Eleven distinct figures stand on the stairs in the central right portion of the design; other indistinct shapes likely represent additional figures. A gowned male with long hair and a beard stands ninth from the left. He faces forward with his head turned slightly right and his mouth open. The figure's left foot is raised on tiptoe and he may descend the staircase. Both arms are bent upward and the palms of his hands are held vertically.

Three figures lie submerged at the bottom of the lake; they are upside down with their heads oriented down, towards the viewer. They may have drowned. A nude(?) male with long hair and a beard appears furthest left. He faces up with his head turned to the left. Both legs are bent and drawn up with the knees prominent. The figure's left arm is bent and rests on the ground beside his head; his left hand is closed in a fist.
