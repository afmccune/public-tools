Eight figures appear left and right of the maypole in the lower

                     portion of the design. The head, left shoulder and left arm of a figure appear

                     eighth from the left. The figure is featureless and is partially obscured by

                     the personified tree to the right and the child below. The figure's head may

                     rest on its shoulder. Its left arm is raised at 135 degrees with the palm held

                     vertically; it may touch or hold the palm of the figure to the left. The figure's right

                     arm(?) may also be raised above his or her head. The figure may be

                  dancing.
