32 And the Divine Voice was heard in the Songs of Beulah Say -ing When I first Married you. I gave you all my whole Soul I thought that you would love my loves & joy in my delights Seeking for pleasures in my pleasures O Daughter of Babylon Then thou wast lovely, mild & gentle, now thou art terrible In jealousy & unlovely in my sight. because thou hast cruelly Cut off my loves in fury till I have no love left for thee Thy love depends on him thou lovest & on his dear loves Depend thy pleasures which thou hast cut off by jealousy Therefore I shew my Jealousy & set before you Death. Behold Milton descended to Redeem the Female Shade From Death Eternal; such your lot, to be continually Redeem'd By death & misery of those you love & by Annihilation When the Sixfold Female percieves that Milton annihilates Himself; that seeing all his loves by her cut off: he leaves Her also: intirely abstracting himself from Female loves She shall relent in fear of death; She shall begin to give Her maidens to her husband: delighting in his delight And then & then alone begins the happy Female joy As it is done in Beulah, & thou O Virgin Babylon Mother of Whoredoms Shalt bring Jerusalem in thine arms in the night watches; and No longer turning her a wandering Harlot in the streets Shalt give her into the arms of God your Lord & Husband. Such are the Songs of Beulah. in the Lamentations of Ololon N Urthona Adam WTharmasLuvahE Satan Miltons Track Urizen
