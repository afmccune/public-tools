Bath. mild Physician of Eternity. mysterious power
Whose springs are unsearchable & knowledg  infinite.
Hereford, ancient Guardian of Wales, whose hands
Builded the mountain palaces of Eden. stupendous  works!
Lincoln, Durham & Carlisle, Councellors of Los.
And Ely. Scribe of Los, whose pen no other hand
Dare touch! Oxford, immortal Bard! with eloquence
Divine, he wept over Albion: speaking the words of  God
In mild perswasion: bringing leaves of the Tree of  Life.
Thou art in Error Albion. the Land of Ulro:
One Error not remov'd. will destroy a human Soul
Repose in Beulahs night, till the Error is remov'd
Reason not on both sides. Repose upon our bosoms
Till the Plow of Jehovah. and the Harrow of  Shaddai
Have passed over the Dead, to awake the Dead to  Judgment.
But Albion turn'd away refusing comfort.
Oxford trembled while he spoke, then fainted in the  arms
Of Norwich. Peterboro. Rochester, Chester awful,  Worcester.
Litchfield. Saint Davids. Landaff, Asaph. Bangor.  Sodor.
Bowing their heads devoted: and the Furnaces of  Los
Began to rage. thundering loud the storms began to  roar
Upon the Furnaces, and loud the Furnaces rebellow  beneath
And these the Four in whom the twenty-four appear'd  four-fold:
Verulam. London. York. Edinburgh. mourning one towards  another
Alas!____The time will come, when a mans worst  enemies
Shall be those of his own house and family: in a  Religion
Of Generation, to destroy by Sin and Atonement, happy  Jerusalem.
The Bride and Wife of the Lamb. O God thou art Not an  Avenger!
