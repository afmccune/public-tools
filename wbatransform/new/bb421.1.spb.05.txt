The Fire of God is fallen from Heaven
And the Lord said unto Satan Behold All that he hath is in thy Power
Thy Sons & thy Daughters were eating & drinking Wine in their
eldest Brothers house and behold there came a great wind from the Wilderness
& smote upon the four faces of the house & it fell upon the young Men & they are Dead
