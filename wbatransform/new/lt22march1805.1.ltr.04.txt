to our Dear Respected Miss                         Poole I remain Yours with                         Sincerity William                             Blake P.S. Your Desire that I should                         write a little Advertisement at the Beginning of the Ballads                         has set my Brains to work & at length producd the following. Simplicity as you desired has been my first object. I send                         it for your Correction or Condemnation begging you to                         supply its deficiency or to New_ Create it according to your wish These The Public ought to be informd that  Ballads were the Effusions of Friendship                         to Countenance what their Author is kindly pleased                         to call Talents for Designing. and to relieve my                         more laborious engagement of Engraving those Portraits which accompany The                         Life of Cowper Out of a number of Designs I                         have selected Five hope that the Public will                         approve of my rather giving few highly labourd Plates than a greater number & less finishd. If I have succeeded in these more may be added at                         Pleasure Will Blake
