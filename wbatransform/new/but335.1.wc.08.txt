Ode on the Death of
a Favourite Cat
Design.
1. "Midst the tide
Two Angel forms were seen to glide"
2. "Demurest of the Tabby kind"
3 "The pensive Selima
Her ears of Jet & Emrald Eyes
She saw & purr'd applause"
4. "Still had she gazd but midst the tide
Two Angel forms were seen to glide
The hapless nymph with wonder saw
A Whisker first & then a Claw &c"
5. "Malignant Fate sat by & smild
The slippery verge her feet beguild
She tumbled head long in"
6 ."Nine times emerging from the flood
"She mew'd to every watry God"
