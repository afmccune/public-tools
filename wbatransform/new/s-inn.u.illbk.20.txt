A CRADLE SONG
Sweet dreams form a shade,
O'er my lovely infants head,
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams,
By happy silent moony beams
Sweet sleep with soft down.
Weave thy brows an infant crown.
Sweet sleep Angel mild,
Hover o'er my happy child.
Sweet smiles in the night,
Hover over my delight.
Sweet smiles Mothers smiles
All the livelong night beguiles.
Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,
Chase not slumber from thy eyes,
Sweet moans, sweeter smiles.
All the dovelike moans beguiles.
Sleep sleep happy child.
All creation slept and smil'd,
Sleep sleep. happy sleep.
While o'er thee thy mother weep
Sweet babe in thy face.
Holy image I can trace.
Sweet babe once like thee.
Thy maker lay and wept for me
Wept
