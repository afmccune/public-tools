Awake! Awake Jerusalem! O lovely Emanation of  Albion
Awake and overspread all Nations as in Ancient  Time
For lo: the Night of Death is past and the Eternal  Day
Appears upon our Hills! Awake Jerusalem. and come  away
So spake the Vision of Albion & in him so spake in my  hearing
The Universal Father Then Albion stretchd his hand  into Infinitude.
And took his Bow, Fourfold the Vision for bright  beaming Urizen
Layd his hand on the South & took a breathing Bow of  carved Gold
Luvah his hand stretch'd to the East & bore a Silver  Bow bright shining
Tharmas Westward a Bow of Brass pure flaming richly  wrought
Urthona Northward in thick storms a Bow of Iron  terrible thundering
And the Bow is a Male & Female & the Quiver of the  Arrows of Love.
Are the Children of this Bow: a Bow of Mercy & Loving-kindness: laying
Open the hidden Heart in Wars of mutual Benevolence  Wars of Love
And the Hand of Man grasps firm between the Male &  Female Loves
And he Clothed himself in Bow & Arrows in awful state  Fourfold
In the midst of his Twenty-eight Cities each with his  Bow breathing
