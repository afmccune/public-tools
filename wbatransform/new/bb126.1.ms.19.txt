Long John Brown & Mary Bell  19 
Little
 Mary Bell had a Fairy in a Nut
Long
 John Brown had the Devil in his Gut
Long Little
 John Brown lovd Mary Bell
And the Fairy drew the Devil                         into the Nut-shell
Her Fairy skipd out & her Fairy Skipd in
He laughd at the Devil saying Love is a Sin 
The Devil he raged & the                         devil he was wroth 
And the Devil enterd into the Young Mans broth
He was soon in the Gut of the                         loving Young Swain
For John eat & drank to                         drive away Loves pain
But all he could do he grew                         thinner & thinner
Tho he eat & drank as                         much as ten Men for his dinner
Some said he had a Wolf in                         his stomach day & night
Some said he had the Devil                         & they guessd right
The fairy skipd about in his Glory Joy & Pride
And he laughd at the Devil till poor John Brown died
Then the Fairy skipd out of the old Nut shell
And woe & alack for                         Pretty Mary Bell
For the Devil crept in when The Fairy skipd out
And there goes Miss Bell with                         her fusty old Nut
