These are the Sons of Los, & these the Labourers of the Vintage
Thou seest the gorgeous clothed Flies that dance & sport in summer
Upon the sunny brooks & meadows: every one the dance.
Knows in its intricate mazes of delight artful to weave:
Each one to sound his instruments of music in the dance, 
To touch each other & recede; to cross & change & return
These are the Children of Los; thou seest the Trees on mountains
The wind blows heavy. loud they thunder thro' the darksom sky
Uttering prophecies & speaking instructive words to the sons
Of men: These are the Sons of Los! These the Visions of Eternity 
But we see only as it were the hem of their garments.
When with our vegetable eyes we view these wond'rous Visions
There are Two Gates thro which all Souls descend.  One Southward
From Dover Cliff to Lizard Point. the other toward the North
Caithness & rocky Durness. Pentland & John Groats House 
The Souls descending to the Body. wail on the right hand
Of Los; & those deliverd from the Body. on the left hand
For Los against the east his force continually bends
Along the Valleys of Middlesex from Hounslow to Blackheath
Lest those Three Heavens of Beulah should the Creation destroy.
And lest they should descend before the north & south Gates
Groaning with pity. he among the wailing Souls laments.
And these the Labours of the Sons of Los in Allamanda.
And in the City of Golgonooza: & in Luban: & around
The Lake of Udan-Adan. in the Forests of Entuthon Benython
Where Souls incessant wail. being piteous Passions & Desires
With neither lineament nor form but like to watry clouds
The Passions & Desires descend upon the hungry winds
For such alone Sleepers remain meer passion & appetite:
The Sons of Los clothe them & feed & provide houses & fields
And every Generated Body in its inward form.
Is a garden of delight & a building of magnificence.
Built by the Sons of Los in Bowlahoola & Allamanda
And the herbs & flowers & furniture & beds & chambers
Continually woven in the Looms of Enitharmons Daughters 
In bright Cathedrons golden Dome with care & love & tears
For the various Classes of Men are all markd out determinate
In Bowlahoola; & as the Spectres choose their affinities
So they are born on Earth, & every Class is determinate
But not by Natural but by Spiritual power alone. Because
The Natural power continually seeks & tends to Destruction
Ending in Death: which would of itself be Eternal Death
And all are Class'd by Spiritual, & not by Natural power.
And every Natural Effect has a Spiritual Cause, and Not
A Natural. for a Natural Cause only seems; it is a Delusion
Of Ulro: & a ratio of the perishing Vegetable Memory:
