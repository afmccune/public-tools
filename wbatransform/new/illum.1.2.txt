    Engravers also used a leather pad (fig. 9) upon which the plate is engraved and turned, a hammer and anvil (figs. 12, 13) to plane and repair plates, a tightly rolled piece of felt and oil (figs. 16, 19) for polishing the plates surface, a compass (fig. 17) for measurements, and calipers (fig. 18) to mark the point on the plates verso that needed to be hammered up when lines on the surface had been scraped down to erase a mistake.
