ing thus much in justice to our                         good Seagrave, whose replies to Mr.
Johnson's aggravating letters have                         been represented to Mr. Rose in
an unfair light, as I have no                         doubt; because Mr. Johnson has, at times,
written such letters to me as                         would have called for the sceptre of Aga-
memnon rather than the tongue of                         Ulysses, and I will venture to give
it as my settled opinion that if                         you suffer yourself to be persuaded to
print in London you will be                         cheated every way; but, however, as
some little excuse, I must say that                         in London every calumny and
falsehood utter'd against another                         of the same trade is thought fair
play. Engravers, Painters,                         Statuaries, Printers, Poets we are not in a
field of battle but in a City of                         Assassinations. This makes your lot truly
enviable, and the country is not                         only more beautiful on account of its
expanded meadows, but also on                         account of its benevolent minds.
My wife joins with me in the                         hearty wish that you may long enjoy
your beautiful retirement.
I am, with best                         respects to Miss Poole, for whose health we
constantly send wishes to our                         spiritual friends,
Yours sincerely,
WILLIAM BLAKE.
P.S.â€”Mr. Walker                         says that Mr. Cumberland is right in his reckon-
ing of Romney's age. Mr. W. says                         Romney was two years older than
himself, consequently was born                         1734.
Mr. Flaxman told me                         that Mr. Romney was three years in Italy;
that he returned twenty-eight                         years since. Mr. Humphry, the Painter,
was in Italy the same time with                         Mr. Romney. Mr. Romney lodged
at Mr. Richter's, Great Newport                         Street, before he went; took the
house in Cavendish Square                         immediately on his return; but as Flax-
man has promised to put pen to                         paper you may expect a full account
of all he can collect. Mr. Sanders                         does not know the time when
Mr. R. took or left Cavendish                         Square house.
