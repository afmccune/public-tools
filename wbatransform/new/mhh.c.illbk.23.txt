greatest men best, those who envy or calumniate 
great men hate God, for there is no other God. 
The Angel hearing this became almost blue 
but mastering himself he grew yellow, & at last 
white pink & smiling. and then replied, 
Thou Idolater, is not God One? & is not he 
visible in Jesus Christ? and has not Jesus Christ 
given his sanction to the law of ten commandments 
and are not all other men fools. sinners, & nothings? 
The Devil answer'd; bray a fool in a morter with 
wheat, yet shall not his folly be beaten out of him: 
if Jesus Christ is the greatest man, you ought to 
love him in the greatest degree; now hear how he 
has given his sanction to the law of ten command- 
ments: did he not mock at the sabbath, and so 
mock the sabbaths God? murder those who were 
murderd because of him? turn away the law from 
the woman taken in adultery? steal the labor of 
others to support him? bear false witness when 
he omitted making a defence before Pilate? covet 
when he pray'd for his disciples, and when he bid 
them shake off the dust of their feet against such 
as refused to lodge them? I tell you, no virtue 
can exist without breaking these ten command- 
-ments; Jesus was all virtue, and acted from im- 
-pulse
