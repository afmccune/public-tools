In his hand, he took, the Golden                         Compasses, prepared In Gods eternal store, to                         circumscribe This Universe, and all created                         things. One foot he center'd, and the other turn'd, Round through the vast profundity                         obscure, And said, thus far extend, thus far                         thy bounds This be thy just circumference, O                             World!
