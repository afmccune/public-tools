Jerusalem.
Chap: 2.
Every ornament of perfection, and every labour of  love,
In all the Garden of Eden, & in all the golden  mountains
Was become an envied horror, and a remembrance of  jealousy:
And every Act a Crime, and Albion the punisher &  judge.
And Albion spoke from his secret seat and said
All these ornaments are crimes. they are made by the  labours
Of loves: of unnatural consanguinities and  friendships
Horrid to think of when enquired deeply into; and  all
These hills & valleys are accursed witnesses of  Sin
I therefore condense them into solid rocks.  stedfast!
A foundation and certainty and demonstrative  truth:
That Man be separate from Man, & here I plant my  seat.
Cold snows drifted around him: ice coverd his loins  around
He sat by Tyburns brook, and underneath his heel, shot up!
A deadly Tree, he nam'd it Moral Virtue. and the  Law
Of God who dwells in Chaos hidden from the human  sight.
The Tree spread over him its cold shadows, (Albion  groand)
They bent down, they felt the earth and again  enrooting
Shot into many a Tree! an endless labyrinth of  woe!
From willing sacrifice of Self. to sacrifice of  (miscall'd) Enemies
For Atonement: Albion began to erect twelve  Altars,
Of rough unhewn rocks. before the Potters Furnace
He nam'd them Justice. and Truth. And Albions Sons
Must have become the first Victims, being the first  transgressors
But they fled to the mountains to seek ransom:  building A Strong
Fortification against the Divine Humanity and  Mercy.
In Shame & Jealousy to annihilate Jerusalem!
