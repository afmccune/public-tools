 The Grey Monk
I die I die the Mother                         said
My Children die for lack of                         Bread
What more has the merciless                         Tyrant said
The Monk sat down on the                         Stony Bed
The blood red ran from the                         Grey Monks side
His hands & feet were                         wounded wide
His Body bent his arms &                         knees
Like to the roots of ancient                         trees
His eye was dry no tear could                         flow
A hollow groan first spoke                         his woe
He trembled & shudderd upon the Bed
At length with a feeble cry                         he said
When God commanded this hand                         to write
In the studious hours of deep                         midnight 
He told me the writing I                         wrote should prove
The Bane of all that in Earth                         I lovd
My Brother starvd between two Walls
His Childrens Cry my Soul                         appalls
I mockd at the wrack & griding chain
My bent body mocks their                         torturing pain
Thy Father drew his Sword in                         the North
With his thousands strong he                         marched forth
