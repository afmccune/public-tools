8 To behold the wandring Moon
 Riding near her highest Noon
 Like one that has been led astray
 Thro the heaving wide pathless way
 And oft as if her head she bowd
 Stooping thro' a fleecy Cloud
 Oft on a plat of rising ground
 I hear the far off Curfew Sound
 Over Some wide waterd Shore
 Swinging slow with Sullen roar
 Milton in his Character of a Student
 at Cambridge. Sees the Moon terrified
 as one led astray in the midst of her
 path thro heaven. The distant Steeple
 Seen across a wide water indicates
 the Sound of the Curfew Bell
