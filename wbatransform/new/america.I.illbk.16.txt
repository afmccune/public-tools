In the flames stood & view'd the armies drawn out in  the sky
Washington Franklin Paine & Warren Allen Gates &  Lee:
And heard the voice of Albions Angel give the  thunderous command,
His plagues obedient to his voice flew forth out of  their clouds
Falling upon America, as a storm to cut them off
As a blight cuts the tender corn when it begins to  appear.
Dark is the heaven above, & cold & hard the earth  beneath;
And as a plague wind fill'd with insects cuts off man  & beast;
And as a sea o'erwhelms a land in the day of an  earthquake;
Fury! rage! madness! in a wind swept through America
And the red flames of Orc that folded roaring fierce  around
The angry shores, and the fierce rushing of  th' inhabitants together;
The citizens of New-York close their books & lock  their chests;
The mariners of Boston drop their anchors and  unlade;
The scribe of Pensylvania casts his pen upon the  earth;
The builder of Virginia throws his hammer down in  fear.
Then had America been lost, o'erwhelm'd by the  Atlantic,
And Earth had lost another portion of the  infinite,
But all rush together in the night in wrath and  raging fire
The red fires rag'd! the plagues recoil'd!  then rolld they back 
with fury
