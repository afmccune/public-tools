as it would cut off ten guineas                         from my next demand on Phillips,
which sum I am in absolute want                         of; as well as that I should lose
all the labour I have been at on                         that plate, which I consider as one
of my best; I know it has cost me                         immense labour. The way in
which I discovered this mistake is                         odd enough. Mr. Phillips objects
altogether to the insertion of my                         Advertisement, calling it an appeal
to charity, and says that it will                         hurt the sale of the work, and he sent
to me the last sheet by the penny                         (that is the twopenny) post,
desiring that I would forward it                         to Mr. Seagrave. But I have
inclosed it to you, as you ought and must see it. I am no judge in
these matters, and leave all to                         your decision, as I know that you will
do what is right on all hands.                         Pray accept my and my wife's sincerest
love and gratitude.
WILL. BLAKE.
