London Sunday Morning
Dear Madam
Mr Linnell will have arrived at his Journeys end
before the time I now write. he set off Last night
before Eight O Clock from the Angel Inn near St Clements
Church Strand in one of the Strongest & Handsomest Built
Stages I ever Saw I should have written Last Night
but as it would not come before now I do as 
Mr Linnell desired I would do by the First Stage
My Wife desires her kindest remembrances to you
& I am Yours Sincerely
Willm Blake
Excuse the writing
I have delayed too long
