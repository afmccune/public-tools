The Pilgrim, by Ann Radcliff.
Slow oe'r the Apannine with bleeding feet,
A Patient Pilgrim wound his lonely                             way,
To deck the Lady of Loretto's                             seat,
With all the little wealth his zeal                         could pay.
From mountain tops cold died the                         evening ray,
And stretch't in twilight slept the vale below,
And now the last last purple streaks                         of day
Along the melancholy West fade slow. 
High o'er his head the restless Pines complain,
As on their summits rolls the breze of night
Beneath, the  hoarse stream chides the rocks in vain,
The Pilgrim pauses on the dizzy                         heights,
Then to the vale his cautious steps                         he prest,
For there a Hermits Cross was dimly                             seen
Cresting the rock, and there his                         limbs might rest,
(cheerd in the good mans cave by faggot sheen).
On leafy beds, nor guile his sleep                         molest,
Unhappy Luke! he trusts a treacherous clue! 
Behind the Cliff the lurking Robber                         stood,
No friendly moon his Giant shadow                             threw,
Athwart the road, to save the                         Pilgrims blood;
On as he went a vesper hymn he                         sang,
The Hymn that nightly soothed him to                         repose;
Fierce on his harmless prey thae                         Ruffian sprang,
The Pilgrim bleeds to death, his                         eyelids close,
Yet his meek spirit knew no vengeful                         care,
But dying for his Murd'rer breathed a sainted prayr!
