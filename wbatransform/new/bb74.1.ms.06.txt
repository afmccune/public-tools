  Chap 6  
They all went home & left the Philosophers. then Suction  Askd
if Pindar was not a better Poet than  Ghiotto was a Painter
Plutarch has not the life of  Ghiotto said Sipsop no said Quid
to be sure he was an Italian. well said Suction that is not
any proof, Plutarch was a nasty ignorant puppy said Quid
I hate your sneaking rascals,  theres Aradobo in  ten or twelve
years will be a far superior genius. Ah said the Pythagorean
Aradobo will make a very clever fellow. why said Quid I think
any
that  natural fool would make a clever fellow if he was properly
brought up __ Ah hang your reasoning said the Epicurean I
hate reasoning I do every thing by my feelings __
Ah said Sipsop. I only wish Jack  Tearguts had had the 
cutting of Plutarch he understands anatomy better than any of the
Ancients  hell plunge his knife up to the hilt in a single drive
and thrust his fist in, and all in the space of a Quarter of an
hour. he does not mind their crying __  tho they cry ever so he'll
Swear at them & keep them down with his fist & tell them that
 hell scrape their bones if they  dont lay still & be quiet _ What.
the devil should the people in the hospital that have it
done for nothing, make such a piece of work for
Hang that said Suction let us have a Song
Then  the Cynic sang
When old corruption first begun
Adornd in yellow vest
He committed on flesh a whoredom
O what a wicked beast
2
From them a callow babe did spring
And old corruption smild
To think his race should never end
For now he had a child
3
He calld him Surgery & fed
The babe with his own milk
For flesh & he could neer agree
She would not let him suck
