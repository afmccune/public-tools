twenty; thank God I was not                         altogether a beast as he was; but I
was a slave bound in a mill among                         beasts and devils; these beasts
and these devils are now, together                         with myself, become children of
light and liberty, and my feet and                         my wife's feet are free from fetters.
O lovely Felpham, parent of                         Immortal Friendship, to thee I am
eternally indebted for my three                         years' rest from perturbation and
the strength I now enjoy.                         Suddenly, on the day after visiting the
Truchsessian Gallery of Pictures,                         I was again enlightened with the
light I enjoyed in my youth, and                         which has for exactly twenty years
been closed from me as by a door                         and by window-shutters. Conse-
quently I can, with confidence,                         promise you ocular demonstration
of my altered state on the plates                         I am now engraving after Romney,
whose spiritual aid has not a                         little conduced to my restoration to the
light of Art. O the distress I                         have undergone, and my poor wife
with me. Incessantly labouring and                         incessantly spoiling what I had
done well. Every one of my friends                         was astonished at my faults,
and could not assign a reason;                         they knew my industry and ab-
stinence from every pleasure for                         the sake of study, and yet—and yet
—and yet there wanted the                         proofs of industry in my works. I
thank God with entire confidence                         that it shall be so no longer:
—he is become my servant who                         domineered over me, he is even as
a brother who was my enemy. Dear                         Sir, excuse my enthusiasm or
rather madness, for I am really                         drunk with intellectual vision when-
ever I take a pencil or graver                         into my hand, even as I used to be
in my youth, and as I have not                         been for twenty dark, but very profitable,
years. I thank God that I                         courageously pursued my course through
darkness. In a short time I shall                         make my assertion good that I
am become suddenly as I was at                         first, by producing the Head of
Romney and the                             Shipwreck quite another thing from what you or
I ever expected them to be. In                         short, I am now satisfied and proud
of my work, which I have not been                         for the above long period.
If our excellent and                         manly friend Meyer is yet with you, please
to make my wife's and my own most                         respectful and affectionate
compliments to him, also to our                         kind friend at Lavant.
I remain, with my                         wife's joint affection,
Your sincere and                         obliged servant,
WILL. BLAKE.
