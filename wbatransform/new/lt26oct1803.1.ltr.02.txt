to be one of those which he has                         rolled on large rollers. He will take
them down and unroll them, but                         cannot do it easily, as they are so
large as to occupy the whole                         length of his workshop, and are laid
across beams at the top.
Mr. Flaxman is now out                         of town. When he returns I will lose
no time in setting him to work on                         the same object.
I have got to work                         after Fuseli for a little Shakespeare. Mr.
Johnson the bookseller tells me                         that there is no want of work. So
far you will be rejoiced with me,                         and your words, 'Do not fear you
can want                             employment!' were verified this morning after I received
your kind letter; but I go on                         finishing Romney with spirit, and for
the relief of variety shall engage                         in other little works as they arise.
I called on Mr. Evans                         who gives small hopes of our ballads; he
says he has sold but fifteen                         numbers at the most, and that going on
would be a certain loss of almost                         all the expenses. I then proposed
to him to take a part with me in                         publishing them on a smaller scale,
which he declined on account of                         its being out of his line of business
to publish, and a line in which he                         is determined never to engage,
attaching himself wholly to the                         sale of fine editions of authors and
curious books in general. He                         advises that some publisher should
be spoken to who would purchase                         the copyright: and, as far as I can
judge of the nature of                         publication, no chance is left to one out of
the trade. Thus the case stands at                         present. God send better
times. Everybody complains, yet                         all go on cheerfully and with
spirit. The shops in London                         improve; everything is elegant, clean,
and neat; the streets are widened                         where they were narrow; even 
Snow Hill is become almost level                         and is a very handsome street, and
the narrow part of the Strand near                         St. Clement's is widened and
become very elegant.
My wife continues                         poorly, but fancies she is better in health here
than by the seaside. We both                         sincerely pray for the health of Miss
Poole and for all our friends in                         Sussex, and remain, dear sir,
Your sincere and                         devoted servants, 
W. and C. BLAKE.
