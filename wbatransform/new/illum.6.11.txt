    Colors can be added to inked plates and printed with ink simultaneously to produce a “color print.” The colors can be oil based inks or, in the case of Blake’s illuminated plates, water-based, pigments mixed with glue or gum Arabic. The water-based colors, should they dry on the plate, are reconstituted when printed onto damp paper.
