27 To the Jews. Jerusalem the Emanation of the Giant  Albion! Can it be? Is it a  Truth that the Learned have explored? Was Britain the  Primitive Seat of the Patriarchal Religion? If it is true: my title-page  is also True, that Jerusalem was & is the Emanation of the Giant Albion.  It is True. and cannot be controverted. Ye are united O ye Inhabitants  of Earth in One Religion. The Religion of Jesus: the most Ancient, the  Eternal: & the Everlasting Gospel __ The Wicked will turn it to  Wickedness, the Righte- -ous to Righteousness. Amen! Huzza! Selah! "All things Begin & End in Albions                                            Ancient Druid Rocky Shore." Your Ancestors derived their origin from  Abraham, Heber. Shem. and Noah. who were Druids: as the Druid Temples (which are  the Patriarch- -al Pillars & Oak Groves) over the whole Earth witness  to this day. You have a tradition, that Man anciently  containd in his mighty limbs all things in Heaven & Earth: this you recieved from  the Druids. "But now the Starry Heavens are fled                                            from the mighty limbs of Albion" Albion was the Parent of the Druids; & in  his Chaotic State of Sleep Satan & Adam & the whole World was Created by the  Elohim. The fields from Islington to Marybone, To Primrose Hill and Saint Johns Wood: Were builded over with pillars of gold,  And there Jerusalems pillars stood.  Her Little-ones ran on the fields The Lamb of God among them seen And fair Jerusalem his Bride: Among the little meadows green. Pancrass & Kentish-town repose Among her golden pillars high; Among her golden arches which Shine upon the starry sky. The Jews-harp-house & the Green Man; The Ponds where Boys to bathe delight: The fields of Cows by Willans farm: Shine in Jerusalems pleasant sight. She walks upon our meadows green: The Lamb of God walks by her side:  And every English Child is seen,  Children of Jesus & his Bride.  Forgiving trespasses and sins Lest Babylon with cruel Og, With Moral & Self-righteous Law Should Crucify in Satans Synagogue! What are those golden Builders doing Near mournful ever-weeping Paddington Standing above that mighty Ruin Where Satan the first victory won. Where Albion slept beneath the Fatal  Tree And the Druids golden Knife, Rioted in human gore. In Offerings of Human Life They groan'd aloud on London Stone They groan'd aloud on Tyburns Brook Albion gave his deadly groan. And all the Atlantic Mountains shook Albions Spectre from his Loins Tore forth in all the pomp of War: Satan his name: in flames of fire He stretch'd his Druid Pillars far, Jerusalem fell from Lambeth's Vale. Down thro Poplar & Old Bow; Thro Malden & acros the Sea, In War & howling death & woe, The Rhine was red with human blood: The Danube rolld a purple tide; On the Euphrates Satan stood: And over Asia stretch'd his pride. He witherd up sweet Zions Hill. From every Nation of the Earth; He witherd up Jerusalems Gates, And in a dark Land gave her birth. He witherd up the Human Form, By laws of sacrifice for sin: Till it became a Mortal Worm: But. O! translucent all within. The Divine Vision still was seen Still was the Human Form, Divine Weeping in weak & mortal clay O Jesus still the Form was thine. And thine the Human Face & thine The Human Hands & Feet & Breath Entering thro' the Gates of Birth And passing thro' the Gates of Death And O thou Lamb of God, whom I Slew in my dark self-righteous pride: Art thou returnd to Albions Land! And is Jerusalem thy Bride? Come to my arms & never more Depart; but dwell for ever here: Create my Spirit to thy Love: Subdue my Spectre to thy Fear. Spectre of Albion! warlike Fiend! In clouds of blood & ruin roll'd: I here reclaim thee as my own My Selfhood; Satan! armd in gold. Is this thy soft Family-Love Thy cruel Patriarchal pride Planting thy Family alone Destroying all the World beside. A mans worst enemies are those Of his own house & family; And he who makes his law a curse, By his own law shall surely die. In my Exchanges every Land Shall walk, & mine in every Land, Mutual shall build Jerusalem: Both heart in heart & hand in hand If Humility is Christianity; you O Jews  are the true Christians; If  your tradition that Man contained in his  Limbs, all Animals, is True &  they were separated from him by cruel  Sacrifices; and when compulsory  cruel Sacrifices had brought Humanity into  a Feminine Tabernacle. in the  loins of Abraham & David; the Lamb of God,  the Saviour became appa- -rent on Earth as the Prophets had foretold? The  Return of Israel is a Re- -turn to Mental Sacrifice & War. Take up the Cross O  Israel & follow Jesus.
