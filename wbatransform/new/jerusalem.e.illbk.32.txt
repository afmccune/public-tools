Leaning against the pillars. & his disease rose from  his skirts
Upon the Precipice he stood: ready to fall into Non- Entity.
Los was all astonishment & terror: he trembled sitting  on the Stone
Of London: but the interiors of Albions fibres &  nerves were hidden
From Los; astonishd he beheld only the petrified  surfaces!
And saw his Furnaces in ruins, for Los is the Demon of  the Furnaces,
He saw also the Four Points of Albion reversd  inwards
He siezd his Hammer & Tongs, his iron Poker & his  Bellows,
Upon the valleys of Middlesex, Shouting loud for aid  Divine.
In stern defiance came from Albions bosom Hand, Hyle,  Koban,
Gwantok, Peachy. Brertun, Slaid. Huttn Skofeld. Kock,  Kotope
Bowen, Albions Sons: they bore him a golden couch into  the porch
And on the Couch reposd his limbs, trembling from the  bloody field.
Rearing their Druid Patriarchal rocky Temples around  his limbs.
All thing begin & end. in Albions Ancient Druid Rocky  Shore.)
