I now have it in my power to                         commence publication with many very formidable works. which                         I have finishd & ready A Book price half a guinea may be                         got out at the Expense of Ten pounds & its almost                         certain profits are 500 G. I am only sorry that I did not know                         the methods of publishing years ago & this is one of the                         numerous benefits I have obtaind by coming here for I                         should never have known the nature of Publication unless I had                         known H & his con would nexions & his method of                         managing. It now ^ be folly not to venture publishing. I am                         now Engraving Six little plates for a little work of Mr H's for which I am to have 10 G . each & the certain profits                         of that work are a fortune uineas such as would make me independent                         supposing that I could substantiate such a one of my own                         & I mean to try many But I again say as I                         said before We are very Happy sitting at tea by a wood fire in                         our Cottage the wind singing above our roof & the                         sea roaring at a distance but if sickness comes all is                         unpleasant But my letter to Mr Butts appears to me not to be so explicit as that to you for I told                         you that I should come has to London in the Spring to                         commence Publisher & he ^ offer'd without knowing my intention me every assistance in his                             power^. But since I wrote yours we had made the resolution of                         which we informed him viz to leave Felpham entirely. I also                         told you what I was about & that I was not                         ignorant of what was doing in London in works of art. But I did                         not mention Illness because I hoped to get better (for                         I was really very ill when I wrote to him the last time) & was not then perswaded as I am now that the air tho warm is                         unhealthy However this I know                         will set you at Ease I am now so full of work that I have had no                         time to go on with the Ballads. & my prospects of                         more & more work continu ally are certain.
