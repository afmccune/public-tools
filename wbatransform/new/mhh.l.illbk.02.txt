hurl'd the new born wonder thro' the starry 
night. 
11. The fire, the fire, is falling! 
12. Look up! look up! O citizen of London 
enlarge thy countenance; O Jew, leave coun 
ting gold! return to thy oil and wine; O 
African! black African! (go. winged thought 
widen his forehead.) 
13. The fiery limbs, the flaming hair, shot 
like the sinking sun into the western sea. 
14. Wak'd from his eternal sleep, the hoary 
element roaring fled away; 
15. Down rushd beating his wings in vain 
the jealous king; his grey brow'd councel- 
-lors, thunderous warriors, curl'd veterans, 
among helms, and shields, and chariots 
horses, elephants: banners, castles, slings 
and rocks, 
16. Falling, rushing, ruining! buried in 
the ruins, on Urthona's dens. 
17. All night beneath the ruins, then 
their sullen flames faded emerge round 
the gloomy king, 
18. With thunder and fire: leading his 
starry, hosts thro' the waste wilderness
