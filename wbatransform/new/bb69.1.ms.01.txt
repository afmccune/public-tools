 Mirth. Allegro
1 Heart easing Mirth.
 Haste thee Nymph & bring with thee
 Jest & Youthful Jollity
 Quips & Cranks & Wanton Wiles
 Nods & Becks & wreathed Smiles
 Sport that wrinkled Care derides
 And Laughter holding both his Sides
 Come & trip it as you go
 On the light phantastic toe
 And in thy right hand lead with thee
 The Mountain Nymph Sweet Liberty

 These Personifications are all brought
 together in the First Design. Surrounding
 the Principal Figure which is Mirth
 herself
