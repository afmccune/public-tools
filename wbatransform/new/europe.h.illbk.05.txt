Unwilling I look up to heaven! unwilling  count the stars!
Sitting in fathomless abyss of my immortal  shrine.
I sieze their burning power
And bring forth howling terrors, all  devouring fiery kings.
Devouring & devour'ed roaming on dark and  desolate mountains  
In forests of eternal death, shrieking in  hollow trees.
Ah mother Enitharmon!
Stamp not with solid form this vig'rous  progeny of fires.
I bring forth from my teeming bosom myriads  of flames.
And thou dost stamp them with a signet,  then they roam abroad
And leave me void as death;
Ah! I am drown'd in shady woe, and  visionary joy.
And who shall bind the infinite with an  eternal band?
To compass it with swaddling bands? and who  shall cherish it
With milk and honey? 
I see it smile & I roll inward & my voice  is past.
She ceast & rolld her shady clouds
Into the secret place.
