Movos o Iesous
Jerusalem
Chap: 1
Of the Sleep of Ulro! and of the passage  through
Eternal Death! and of the awaking to Eternal  Life
This theme calls me in sleep night after night, & ev'ry  morn
Awakes me at sun-rise, then I see the Saviour over  me
Spreading his beams of love, & dictating the words of  this mild song.
Awake! awake O sleeper of the land of shadows, wake!  expand!
I am in you and you in me, mutual in love divine:
Fibres of love from man to man thro Albions pleasant  land.
In all the dark Atlantic vale down from the hills of  Surrey
A black water accumulates, return Albion! return!
Thy brethren call thee. and thy fathers, and thy  sons,
Thy nurses and thy mothers, thy sisters and thy  daughters
Weep at thy souls disease, and the Divine Vision is  darkend:
Thy Emanation that was wont to play before thy  face,
Beaming forth with her daughters into the Divine  bosom.
Where hast thou hidden thy Emanation lovely  Jerusalem
From the vision and fruition of the Holy-one?
I am not a God afar off, I am a brother and friend;
Within your bosoms I reside, and you reside in me:
Lo! we are One; forgiving all Evil; Not seeking  recompense!
Ye are my members O ye sleepers of Beulah. land of  shades!
But the perturbed Man away turns down the valleys dark;

Phantom of the over heated brain! shadow of  immortality!
Seeking to keep my soul a victim to thy Love! which  binds
Man the enemy of man into deceitful friendships;
Jerusalem is not! her daughters are indefinite;
By demonstration, man alone can live, and not by faith.
My mountains are my own, and I will keep them to  myself:
The Malvern and the Cheviot, the Wolds Plinlimmon &  Snowdon
Are mine. here will I build my Laws of Moral  Virtue:
Humanity shall be no more: but war & princedom &  victory!
So spoke Albion in jealous fears, hiding his  Emanation
Upon the Thames and Medway, rivers of Beulah:  dissembling
His jealousy before the throne divine, darkening.  cold!
