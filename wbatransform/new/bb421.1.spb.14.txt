12
For God speaketh once yea twice
& Man percieveth it not
That he may withdraw Man from his purpose
& hide Pride from Man
If there be with him an Interpreter One among a Thousand
In a Dream in a Vision of the Night
in deep Slumberings upon the bed
Then he openeth the ears of Men & sealeth their instruction
then he is gracious unto him
& saith Deliver him from going down to the Pit
I have found a Ransom
For his eyes are upon
the ways of Man & he observeth
all his goings
I am Young & ye are very Old wherefore I was afraid
Lo all these things worketh God oftentimes with Man to bring
back his Soul from the pit to be enlightened
with the light of the living
Look upon the heavens & behold the clouds
which are higher
 than thou
If thou sinnest. what
doest thou against him. or if thou be
righteous what givest thou unto him
