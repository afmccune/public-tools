Dear Sir
If this Notice should be                         too short for your Convenience please
to let me know. But finding myself                         Well enough to come I propose
to set out from here as soon after                         ten as we can on Thursday Morning
Our Carriage will be a                         Cabriolet. for tho getting better & stronger
I am still incapable of riding in                         the Stage & shall be I fear for Some
time being only bones & sinews                         All strings & bobbins like a Weavers
Loom. Walking to & from the                         Stage would be to me impossible tho
I seem well being entirely free                         from both pain & from that Sickness
to which there is no name. Thank                         God I feel no more of it & have
great hopes that the disease is                             Gone
I am dear Sir Yours                         Sincerely
Augst 1. 1826  William Blake
