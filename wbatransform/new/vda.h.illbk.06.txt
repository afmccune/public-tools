   And none but Bromion can hear my lamentations.
    With what sense is it that the chicken shuns the ravenous hawk?
 With what sense does the tame pigeon measure out the expanse?
 With what sense does the bee form cells? have not the mouse & frog
 Eyes and ears and sense of touch? yet are their habitations.
 And their pursuits, as different as their forms and as their joys:
 Ask the wild ass why he refuses burdens: and the meek camel
 Why he loves man: is it because of eye ear mouth or skin
 Or breathing nostrils? No, for these the wolf and tyger have.
 Ask the blind worm the secrets of the grave, and why her spires
 Love to curl round the bones of death! and ask the rav'nous snake 
 Where she gets poison: & the wing'd eagle why he loves the sun
 And then tell me the thoughts of man, that have been hid of old.
    Silent I hover all the night, and all day could be silent.
 If Theotormon once would turn his loved eyes upon me;
 How can I be defild when I reflect thy image pure?   (woe
 Sweetest the fruit that the worm feeds on. & the soul prey'd on by
 The new wash'd lamb ting'd with the village smoke & the bright swan
 By the red earth of our immortal river: I bathe my wings,
 And I am white and pure to hover round Theotormons breast.
    Then Theotormon broke his silence. and he answered.
    Tell me what is the night or day to one o'erflowd with woe?
 Tell me what is a thought? & of what substance is it made?
 Tell me what is a joy? & in what gardens do joys grow?
 And in what rivers swim the sorrows? and upon what mountains
