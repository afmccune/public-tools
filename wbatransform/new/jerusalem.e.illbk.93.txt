Enitharmon heard. She raisd her head like the mild  Moon

O Rintrah! O Palamabron! What are your dire & awful  purposes
Enitharmons name is nothing before you: you forget all  my Love!
The Mothers love of obedience is forgotten & you seek  a Love
Of the pride of dominion. that wilt Divorce Ocalythron  & Elynittria
Upon East Moor in Derbyshire & along the Valleys of  Cheviot
Could you Love me Rintrah, if you Pride not in my  Love
As Reuben found Mandrakes in the field & gave them to  his Mother
Pride meets with Pride upon the Mountains in the  stormy day
In that terrible Day of Rintrahs Plow & of Satans  driving the Team.
Ah! then I heard my little ones weeping along the  Valley:
Ah! then I saw my beloved ones fleeing from my  Tent
Merlin was like thee Rintrah among the Giants of  Albion
Judah was like Palamabron: O Simeon! O Levi! ye fled  away
How can I hear my little ones weeping along the  Valley
Or how upon the distant Hills see my beloveds  Tents.
Then Los again took up his speech as Enitharmon  ceast
Fear not my Sons this Waking Death, he is become One  with me
Behold him here! We shall not Die! we shall be united  in Jesus.
Will you suffer this Satan this Body of Doubt that  Seems but Is Not
To occupy the very threshold of Eternal Life. if  Bacon. Newton. Locke
Deny a Conscience in Man & the Communion of Saints &  Angels
Contemning the Divine Vision & Fruition. Worshiping  the Deus
Of the Heathen. The God of This World. & the Goddess  Nature
Mystery Babylon the Great. The Druid Dragon & hidden  Harlot
Is it not that Signal of the Morning which was told us  in the Beginning
Thus they converse upon Mam-Tor. the Graves thunder  under their feet
