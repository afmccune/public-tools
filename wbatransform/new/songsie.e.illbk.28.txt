28 When wolves and tygers howl for prey They pitying stand and weep; Seeking to drive their thirst away. And keep them from the sheep. But if they rush dreadful; The angels most heedful, Recieve each mild spirit. New worlds to inherit. And there the lions ruddy eyes, Shall flow with tears of gold: And pitying the tender cries. And walking round the fold: Saying: wrath by his meekness And by his health. sickness. Is driven away. From our immortal day. And now beside thee bleating lamb. I can lie down and sleep; Or think on him who bore thy name. Graze after thee and weep. For wash'd in life's river. My bright mane for ever. Shall shine like the gold. As I guard o'er the fold.
