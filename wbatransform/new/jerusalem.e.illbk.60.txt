60 The clouds of Albions Druid Temples rage in the  eastern heaven While Los sat terrified beholding Albions Spectre who  is Luvah Spreading in bloody veins in torments over Europe &  Asia; Not yet formed but a wretched torment unformed &  abyssal In flaming fire; within the Furnaces the Divine Vision  appeard On Albions hills: often walking from the Furnaces in  clouds And flames among the Druid Temples & the Starry  Wheels Gatherd Jerusalems Children in his arms & bore them  like A Shepherd in the night of Albion which overspread all  the Earth I gave thee liberty and life O lovely Jerusalem And thou hast bound me down upon the Stems of  Vegetation I gave thee Sheep-walks upon the Spanish Mountains  Jerusalem I gave thee Priams City and the Isles of Grecia  lovely! I gave thee Hand & Scofield & the Counties of  Albion! They spread forth like a lovely root into the Garden  of God: They were as Adam before me: united into One Man. They stood in innocence & their skiey tent reachd over  Asia To Nimrods Tower to Ham & Canaan walking with  Mizraim Upon the Egyptian Nile, with solemn songs to  Grecia And sweet Hesperia even to Great Chaldea &  Tesshina Following thee as a Shepherd by the Four Rivers of  Eden Why wilt thou rend thyself apart, Jerusalem? And build this Babylon & sacrifice in secret  Groves, Among the Gods of Asia; among the fountains of pitch &  nitre Therefore thy Mountains are become barren                                Jerusalem! Thy Valleys, Plains of burning sand. thy Rivers;  waters of death Thy Villages die of the Famine and thy Cities Beg bread from house to house, lovely Jerusalem Why wilt thou deface thy beauty & the beauty of thy  little-ones To please thy Idols, in the pretended chastities of  Uncircumcision Thy Sons are lovelier than Egypt or Assyria;  wherefore Dost thou blacken their beauty by a Secluded place of  rest. And a peculiar Tabernacle. to cut the integuments of  beauty Into veils of tears and sorrows O lovely  Jerusalem! They have perswaded thee to this, therefore their end  shall come And I will lead thee thro the Wilderness in shadow of  my cloud And in my love I will lead thee, lovely Shadow of  Sleeping Albion, This is the Song of the Lamb. sung by Slaves in  evening time. But Jerusalem faintly saw him, closd in the Dungeons  of Babylon Her Form was held by Beulahs Daughters. but all within  unseen She sat at the Mills. her hair unbound her feet  naked Cut with the flints: her tears run down, her reason  grows like The Wheel of Hand. incessant turning day & night  without rest Insane she raves upon the winds hoarse,  inarticulate: All night Vala hears. she triumphs in pride of  holiness To see Jerusalem deface her lineaments with bitter  blows Of despair. while the Satanic Holiness triumphd in  Vala In a Religion of Chastity & Uncircumcised  Selfishness Both of the Head & Heart & Loins. closd up in Moral  Pride. But the Divine Lamb stood beside Jerusalem. oft she  saw, The lineaments Divine & oft the Voice heard, & oft she  said. O Lord & Saviour, have the Gods of the Heathen pierced  thee? Or hast thou been pierced in the House of thy  Friends? Art thou alive! & livest thou for-evermore? or art  thou Not: but a delusive shadow, a thought that liveth  not. Babel mocks saying, there is no God nor Son of God That thou O Human Imagination. O Divine Body art  all A delusion. but I know thee O Lord when thou arisest  upon My weary eyes even in this dungeon & this iron  mill.
