I                                                   felt necessary to my repose at this time. I feel                                                   very strongly
that                                                   I neglect my Duty to my Friends but It is                                                   not
want                                                   of Gratitude or Friendship but perhaps an Excess                                                   of both
Let                                                   me hear of your welfare. Remember My & My                                                   Wifes
Respectful Compliments to Mrs Cumberland &                                                   Family
& believe me to be for Ever
Yours
