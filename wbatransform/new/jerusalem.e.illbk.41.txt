Bath who is Legions; he is the Seventh, the physician  and
The poisoner: the best and worst in Heaven and  Hell:
Whose Spectre first assimilated with Luvah in Albions  mountains
A triple octave he took, to reduce Jerusalem to  twelve
To cast Jerusalem forth upon the wilds to Poplar &  Bow:
To Malden & Canterbury in the delights of cruelty:
The Shuttles of death sing in the sky to Islington &  Pancrass
Round Marybone to Tyburns River, weaving black  melancholy as a net,
And despair as meshes closely wove over the west of  London,
Where mild Jerusalem sought to repose in death & be no  more.
She fled to Lambeths mild Vale and hid herself  beneath
The Surrey Hills where Rephaim terminates: her Sons  are siez'd
For victims of sacrifice; but Jerusalem cannot be  found! Hid
By the Daughters of Beulah: gently snatch'd away: and  hid in Beulah
There is a Grain of Sand in Lambeth that Satan cannot  find
Nor can his Watch Fiends find it: tis translucent &  has many Angles
But he who finds it will find Oothoons palace. for  within
Opening into Beulah every angle is a lovely heaven
But should the Watch Fiends find it, they would call  it Sin
And lay its Heavens & their inhabitants in blood of  punishment
Here Jerusalem & Vala were hid in soft slumberous  repose
Hid from the terrible East. shut up in the South &  West.
The Twenty-eight trembled in Deaths dark caves. in  cold despair
They kneeld around the Couch of Death in deep  humiliation
And tortures of self condemnation while their Spectres  ragd within:
The Four Zoa's in terrible combustion clouded rage
Drinking the shuddering fears & loves of Albions  Families
Destroying by selfish affections the things that they  most admire
Drinking & eating. & pitying & weeping, as at a trajic  scene.
The soul drinks murder & revenge, & applauds its own  holiness
They saw Albion endeavouring to destroy their  Emanations
Each man is in
his Spectre's power
Untill the arrival
of that hour,
When his Humanity
awake
And cast his Spectre
into the Lake
