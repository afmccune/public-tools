Deutermy. ch:34th:v.6th: & Jude v.9th:
And the Lord buried Moses in a valley, in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor; but no
man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.
Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the Devil he disputed about the body
of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, the Lord rebuke thee.
