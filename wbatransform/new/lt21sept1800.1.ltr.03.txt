New life. because another covering of Earth is shaken off. I am
more famed in Heaven for my works than I could well conceive
In my Brain are studies & Chambers filld with books & pictures
of old which I wrote & painted in ages of Eternity. before my mortal
life & those works are the delight & Study of Archangels. Why then
should I be anxious about the riches or fame of mortality. The
Lord our father will do for us & with us according to his Divine
will for our Good
You O Dear Flaxman are a Sublime Archangel My Friend
& Companion from Eternity in the Divine bosom is our Dwelling place
I look back into the regions of Reminiscence & behold our ancient
days before this Earth appeard in its vegetated mortality to my
mortal vegetated Eyes. I see our houses of Eternity which can never
be separated tho our Mortal vehicles should stand at the remotest
corners of heaven from Each other
Farewell My Best Friend Remember Me & My Wife
in Love & Friendship to our Dear Mrs Flaxman whom we ardently
desire to Entertain beneath our thatched roof of rusted gold & believe
me for ever to remain
Your Grateful & Affectionate
Felpham William Blake
