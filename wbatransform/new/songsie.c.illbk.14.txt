They laugh at our play. And soon they all say. Such such were the joys. When we all girls & boys, In our youth-time were seen, On the Ecchoing Green. Till the little ones weary No more can be merry The sun does descend, And our sports have an end: Round the laps of their mothers. Many sisters and brothers, Like birds in their nest. Are ready for rest: And sport no more seen, On the darkening Green.
