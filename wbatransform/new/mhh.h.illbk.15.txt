15 A Memorable Fancy I was in a Printing house in Hell & saw the  method in which knowledge is transmitted from gene-   ration to generation. In the first chamber was a Dragon-Man, clear-  -ing away the rubbish from a caves mouth; within, a  number of Dragons were hollowing the cave, In the second chamber was a Viper folding round  the rock & the cave, and others adorning it with gold  silver and precious stones. In the third chamber was an Eagle with wings  and feathers of air, he caused the inside of the cave   to be infinite, around were numbers of Eagle like  men, who built palaces in the immense cliffs. In the fourth chamber were Lions of flaming fire  raging around & melting the metals into living fluids. In the fifth chamber were Unnam'd forms, which  cast the metals into the expanse. There they were reciev'd by Men who occupied   the sixth chamber, and took the forms of books &  were arranged in libraries.
