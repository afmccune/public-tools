29 A Dream Once a dream did weave a shade. O'er my Angel-guarded bed. That an Emmet lost it's way, Where on grass methought I lay, Troubled wilderd and folorn Dark benighted travel-worn, Over many a tangled spray. All heart-broke I heard her say. O my children! do they cry, Do they hear their father sigh. Now they look abroad to see, Now return and weep for me. Pitying I drop'd a tear; But I saw a glow-worm near: Who replied. What wailing wight Calls the watchman of the night. I am set to light the ground, While the beetle goes his round: Follow now the beetles hum, Little wanderer hie thee home.
