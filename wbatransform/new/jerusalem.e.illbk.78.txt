The Spectres of Albions Twelve Sons revolve  mightily
Over the Tomb & over the Body: ravning to devour
The Sleeping Humanity. Los with his mace of iron
Walks round: loud his threats. loud his blows fall
On the rocky Spectres, as the Potter breaks the  potsherds;
Dashing in pieces Self-righteousnesses: driving them  from Albions
Cliffs; dividing them into Male & Female forms in his  Furnaces
And on his Anvils: lest they destroy the Feminine  Affections
They are broken. Loud howl the Spectres in his iron  Furnace
While Los laments at his dire labours. viewing  Jerusalem,
Sitting before his Furnaces clothed in sackcloth of  hair;
Albions Twelve Sons surround the Forty-two Gates of  Erin,
In terrible armour, raging against the Lamb & against  Jerusalem,
Surrounding them with armies to destroy the Lamb of  God.
They took their Mother Vala, and they crown'd her with  gold:
They namd her Rahab. & gave her power over the Earth
The Concave Earth round Golgonooza in Entuthon  Benython.
Even to the stars exalting her Throne, to build beyond  the Throne
Of God and the Lamb. to destroy the Lamb & usurp the  Throne of God
Drawing their Ulro Voidness round the Four-fold  Humanity
Naked Jerusalem lay before the Gates upon Mount Zion
The Hill of Giants, all her foundations levelld with  the dust:
Her Twelve Gates thrown down: her children carried  into captivity
Herself in chains: this from within was seen in a  dismal night
Outside, unknown before in Beulah. & the twelve gates  were fill'd
With blood; from Japan eastward to the Giants causway.  west
In Erins Continent: and Jerusalem wept upon Euphrates  banks
Disorganizd; an evanescent shade, scarce seen or heard  among
Her childrens Druid Temples dropping with blood  wanderd weeping!
And thus her voice went forth in the darkness of  Philisthea.
My brother & my father are no more! God hath forsaken  me
The arrows of the Almighty pour upon me & my children
I have sinned and am an outcast from the Divine  Presence!
