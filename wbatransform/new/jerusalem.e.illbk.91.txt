91  It is easier to forgive an Enemy than to forgive a  Friend: The man who permits you to injure him, deserves your  vengeance: He also will recieve it: go Spectre! obey my most  secret desire! Which thou knowest without my speaking: Go to these  Fiends of Righteousness Tell them to obey their Humanities, & not pretend  Holiness; When they are murderers: as far as my Hammer & Anvil  permit Go, tell them that the Worship of God, is honouring  his gifts In other men: & loving the greatest men best. each  according To his Genius; which is the Holy Ghost in Man; there  is no other God, than that God who is the intellectual fountain of  Humanity: He who envies or calumniates: which is murder &  cruelty, Murders the Holy-one! Go tell them this & overthrow  their cup, Their bread, their altar-table, their incense & their  oath: Their marriage & their baptism, their burial &  consecration: I have tried to make friends by corporeal gifts but  have only Made enemies: I never made friends but by spiritual  gifts; By severe contentions of friendship & the burning fire  of thought. He who would see the Divinity must see him in his  Children One first, in friendship & love; then a Divine Family,  & in the midst Jesus will appear; so he who wishes to see a Vision; a  perfect Whole Must see it in its Minute Particulars; Organized & not  as thou O Fiend of Righteousness pretendest; thine is a  Disorganized And snowy cloud; brooder of tempests & destructive  War You smile with pomp & rigor: you talk of benevolence &  virtue! I act with benevolence & virtue & get murderd time  after time: You accumulate Particulars, & murder by analyzing,  that you May take the aggregate; & you call the aggregate Moral  Law: And you call that Swelld & bloated Form; a Minute  Particular, But General Forms have their vitality in Particulars:  & every Particular is a Man; a Divine Member of the Divine  Jesus. So Los cried at his Anvil in the horrible darkness  weeping! The Spectre builded stupendous Works, taking the  Starry Heavens Like to a curtain & folding them according to his  will Repeating the Smaragdine Table of Hermes to draw Los  down Into the Indefinite, refusing to believe without  demonstration Los reads the Stars of Albion! the Spectre reads the  Voids Between the Stars; among the arches of Albions Tomb  sublime Rolling the Sea in rocky paths! forming Leviathan And Behemoth; the War by Sea enormous & the War By Land astounding: erecting pillars in the deepest  Hell. To reach the heavenly arches; Los beheld undaunted  furious His heavd Hammer; he swung it round & at one blow, In unpitying ruin driving down the pyramids of  pride Smiting the Spectre on his Anvil & the integuments of  his Eye And Ear unbinding in dire pain, with many blows, Of strict severity self-subduing, & with many tears  labouring. Then he sent forth the Spectre all his pyramids were  grains Of sand & his pillars: dust on the flys wing: & his  starry Heavens; a moth of gold & silver mocking his anxious  grasp Thus Los alterd his Spectre & every Ratio of his  Reason He alterd time after time, with dire pain & many  tears Till he had completely divided him into a separate  space. Terrified Los sat to behold trembling & weeping &  howling I care not whether a Man is Good or Evil; all that I  care Is whether he is a Wise Man or a Fool, Go! put off  Holiness And put on Intellect: or my thundrous Hammer shall  drive thee To wrath which thou condemnest: till thou obey my  voice So Los terrified cries; trembling & weeping & howling!
