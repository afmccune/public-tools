5 The first, The Elect from before the foundation of the World: The second, The Redeem'd. The Third. The Reprobate & Form'd To destruction from the mothers womb:                      follow with me my plow.  Of the first class was Satan: with incomparable mildness; His primitive tyrannical attempts on Los: with most endearing love He soft intreated Los to give him Palamabrons station; For Palamabron returnd with labour wearied every evening Palamabron oft refus'd; and as often Satan offer'd His service till by repeated offers and repeated intreaties Los gave to him the Harrow of the Almighty; alas blamable Palamabron fear'd to be angry lest Satan should accuse him of Ingratitude. & Los believe the accusation thro Satans extreme Mildness, Satan labour'd all day. it was a thousand years  In the evening returning terrified overlabourd & astonish'd Embrac'd soft with a brothers tears Palamabron. who also wept Mark well my words! they are of your eternal salvation Next morning Palamabron rose; the horses of the Harrow Were maddend with tormenting fury, & the servants of the Harrow  The Gnomes, accus'd Satan. with indignation fury and fire. Then Palamabron reddening like the Moon in an eclipse, Spoke saying, You know Satans mildness and his self-imposition, Seeming a brother, being a tyrant, even thinking himself a brother While he is murdering the just; prophetic I behold His future course thro' darkness and despair to eternal death But we must not be tyrants also! he hath assum'd my place For one whole day. under pretence of pity and love to me: My horses hath he maddend! and my fellow servants injur'd: How should he he know the duties of another? O foolish forbearance Would I had told Los, all my heart! but patience O my friends, All may be well: silent remain, while I call Los and Satan. Loud as the wind of Beulah that unroots the rocks & hills Palamabron call'd: and Los & Satan came before him And Palamabron shew'd the horses & the servants.  Satan wept,  And mildly cursing Palamabron, him accus'd of crimes  Himself had wrought.  Los trembled; Satans blandishments almost Perswaded the Prophet of Eternity that Palamabron Was Satans enemy, & that the Gnomes being Palamabron's friends Were leagued together against Satan thro' ancient enmity.  What could Los do? how could he judge, when Satans self, believ'd That he had not oppres'd the horses of the Harrow, nor the servants. So Los said. Henceforth Palamabron, let each his own station Keep: nor in pity false, nor in officious brotherhood, where None needs, be active.  Mean time Palamabrons horses, Rag'd with thick flames redundant, & the Harrow maddend with fury. Trembling Palamabron stood. the strongest of Demons trembled: Curbing his living creatures; many of the strongest Gnomes, They bit in their wild fury, who also madden'd like wildest beasts Mark well my words; they are of your eternal salvation
