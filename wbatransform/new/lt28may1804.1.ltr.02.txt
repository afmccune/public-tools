an American would tell me that                         Washington did all that was done before he was born, as the French                         now adore Buonaparte and the English our poor George; so the                         Americans will consider Washington as their god. This is only                         Grecian, or rather Trojan, worship, and perhaps will be revis'd (?) in an                         age or two. In the meantime I have the happiness of seeing the Divine                         countenance in such men as Cowper and Milton more distinctly                         than in any prince or hero. Mr. Phillips has sent a small                         poem, he would not tell the author's name, but desired me to inclose it                         for you with Washington's Life. Mr. Carr call'd on me,                         and I, as you desired, gave him a history of the reviewing business as far                         as I am acquainted with it. He desires me to express to you that                         he would heartily devote himself to the business in all its laborious                         parts, if you would take on you the direction; and he thinks it might                         be done with very little trouble to you. He is now going to Russia;                         hopes that the negotiations for this business is not wholly at an                         end, but that on his return he may still perform his best, as your                         assistant in it. I have delivered the letter to Mr. Edwards, who will                         give it immediately to Lady Hamilton. Mr. Walker I have again seen; he                         promises to collect numerous particulars concerning Romney and                         send them to you—wonders he has not had a line from you;                         desires me to assure you of his wish to give every information in his                         power. Says that I shall have Lear and Cordelia to                         copy if you desire it should be done; supposes that Romney was about eighteen when he                         painted it; it is therefore doubly interesting. Mr. Walker is                         truly an amiable man; spoke of Mr. Green as the oldest friend of                         Romney, who knew most concern- ing him of any one; lamented the                         little difference that subsisted between you, speaking of you both                         with great affection. Mr. Flax- man has also promised to write all                         he knows or can collect concerning Romney, and send to you. Mr.                         Sanders has promised to write to Mr. J. Romney immediately,                         desiring him to give us liberty to copy any of his father's designs that                         Mr. Flaxman may select for that purpose; doubts not at all of Mr.                         Romney's readiness to send any of the cartoons to London you                         desire; if this can be done it will be all that could be wished.                         I spoke to Mr. Flaxman about choosing out proper subjects for                         our purpose; he has promised to do so. I hope soon to send you                         Flaxman's advice upon this article. When I repeated to Mr. Phillips                         your intention of taking the books you want from his shop, he made a                         reply to the following purpose:— 'I shall be very proud to have Mr.                         Hayley's name in my books, but 'please to express to him my hope                         that he will consider me as the
