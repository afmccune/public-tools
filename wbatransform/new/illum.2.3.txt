    The first tonal printmaking process, dating from the mid-16 th century, was invented to imitate drawings on colored paper in several monochromatic washes. It consisted of multiple woodcuts, with a key block for outline and one or two for tones, printed on top of one another. This technique, called chiaroscuro woodcut, was revived in the 18th century by John Baptist Jackson, whose Descent from the Cross , after Rembrandt, was executed in 1738 as part of a series of prints in imitation of old master paintings.
