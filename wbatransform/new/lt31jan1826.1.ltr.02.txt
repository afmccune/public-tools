Dear Sir
I am forced to write because I cannot come to you
 this on two accounts First I omitted to desire you would come
& take a Mutton chop with us the day you go to Cheltenham & I
will go with you to the to the Coach also I will go to Hampstead to
see Mrs Linnell on Sunday but will return before dinner (I mean if
you settoff before that) & Second I wish to have a Copy of Job
to shew to Mr ChantryChantrey
For I am again laid up by a cold in my stomach the Hamp
this
stead Air as it always did so I fear it always will do  Except it
be the Morning Air &That; in my Cousins time I found I could bear

can know. When I was young Hampstead Highgate Hornsea Muswell
Hill & even Islington & all places North of London always laid me
up the day after & sometimes two or three days with precisely the
same Complaint & the same torment of the Stomach. Easily removed
but excruciating while it lasts & enfeebling for some time after
Sr Francis Bacon would say it is want of Discipline in Mountainous

Man into another even in the least particle. & such discipline
