And Rahab Babylon the Great hath destroyed  Jerusalem
Bath stood upon the Severn with Merlin & Bladud &  Arthur
The Cup of Rahab in his hand; her Poisons Twenty-seven-fold
And all her Twen -seven Heavens now hid & now  reveal'd
Appear in strong delusive light of Time & Space drawn  out
In shadowy pomp by the Eternal Prophet created  evermore
For Los in Six Thousand Years walks up & down  continually
That not one Moment of Time be lost & every  revolution
Of Space he makes permanent in Bowlahoola &  Cathedron.
And these the names of the Twenty-seven Heavens &  their Churches
Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared,  Enoch.
Methuselah, Lamech; these are the Giants mighty,  Hermaphroditic
Noah, Shem, Arphaxad, Cainan the Second, Salah.  Heber,
Peleg, Reu. Serug, Nahor, Terah: these are the Female  Males:
A Male within a Female hid as in an Ark &  Curtains.
Abraham. Moses, Solomon, Paul, Constantine,  Charlemaine.
Luther. these Seven are the Male Females: the Dragon  Forms
The Female hid within a Male: thus Rahab is  reveald
Mystery Babylon the Great; the Abomination of  Desolation
Religion hid in War; a Dragon red. & hidden Harlot
But Jesus breaking thro' the Central Zones of Death &  Hell
Opens Eternity in Time & Space; triumphant in  Mercy
Thus are the Heavens formd by Los within the Mundane  Shell
And where Luther ends Adam begins again in Eternal  Circle
To awake the Prisoners of Death; to bring Albion  again
With Luvah into light eternal. in his eternal day.
But now the Starry Heavens are fled from the mighty  limbs of Al-
