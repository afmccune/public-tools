John Linnell Esqre Cirencester                         Place. Friday Evening Dear Sir March 31. 1826 I have been very ill                         since I saw you but am again well enough to go                         on with my work but not well enough to                         venture out the Chill of the weather soon                         drives me back into that shivring fit which must be avoided till the Cold is gone. Mr Robinson certainly did Subscribe for Prints only & not for                         Proofs for I remember that he offerd to pay me Three Guineas for each of the Copies However if the                         weather should be warm I will Endeavour to come to you                         before Tuesday but much fear that my present                         tottering state will hold me some time yet I am dear Sir yours Sincerely WillmBlake
