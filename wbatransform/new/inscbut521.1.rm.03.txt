     Rev ns : ch: 13: v.1:&2:
 And I stood and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, & upon
 his horns ten crowns, & upon his heads the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw
 was like unto a leopard, & his feet were as the feet of a bear, & his mouth as the mouth of a lion,
 and the dragon gave him his power & his seat & great authority.
