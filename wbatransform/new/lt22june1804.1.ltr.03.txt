I know that all the Good                         Engravers are so Engaged that they
upon
will be hardly prevaild^ to undertake more than One of 
Plates on so short a notice, This                         is Mr Parkers account
of the matter. & perhaps may                         discourage you from the Pursuit
of so Expensive an undertaking.                         it is certain that the Pictures
deserve to be Engraved by the                         hands of Angels & must not by
any means be done in a careless or too hasty manner
The Price Mr Parker has affixd to each is Exactly what
I myself had before concluded                         upon. Judging as he did
that if the Fuseli Shakespeare is worth 25 Guineas, these
will be at least worth 30. &                         that the inferior ones cannot
be done at any rate under 15.
Mr Flaxman advises that the best Engravers                         should
be engaged in the work as its                         magnitude demands all the
Talents that can be procured
Mr Flaxman named the following Eight as proper
subjects for Prints
1 The Vision of Atossa from Eschylus
2 Apparition of Darius
3 Black Eyd Susan. a figure on the Sea shore
embracing a Corse
4  The Shipwreck with the Man on Horseback &c
