To face page 13, ILLUSTRATIONS OF IMITATION OF ECLOGUE I. FRONTISPIECE. THENOT AND COLINET. The Illustrations of this English Pastoral are by the famous BLAKE, the illustrator of Young's Night Thoughts, and Blair's Grave; who designed and engraved them himself.  This is men- tioned, as they display less of art than genius, and are much admired by some eminent painters.
