Work on outline in Notes to  an                                                   Essay on Sculpture
in Six Epistles to John Flaxman. I have                                                   been too little among
friends which I fear they will not                                                   Excuse & I know not how to
apologize for. Poor Fuseli sore from                                                   the lash of Envious tongues
praises you & dispraises with the                                                   same breath he is not naturally
good natured but he is artificially                                                   very ill natured yet even
from him I learn the Estimation you are                                                   held in among artists
& connoisseurs.
I am still Employd in making Designs & little                                                   Pictures
with now & then an Engraving &                                                   find that in future to live will
not be so difficult as it has been It                                                   is very Extraordinary that
London in so few years from a City of                                                   meer Necessaries or at last
a commerce of the lowest order of                                                   luxuries should have become a
City of Elegance in some degree &                                                   that its once stupid inhabitants
should enter into an Emulation of                                                   Grecian manners. There are
now I believe as many Booksellers as                                                   there are Butchers & as
many Printshops as of any other trade                                                   We remember when
a Print shop was a rare bird in London.                                                   & I myself remember
When I                                                   thought my pursuits of Art a kind of criminal                                                   dissipation
& neglect of the main chance which                                                   I hid my face for not
being able to abandon as a Passion                                                   which is forbidden by Law &
Religion but now it appears to be Law                                                   & Gospel too. at least
I hear so from the few friends I have                                                   dared to visit in my stupid
Melancholy. Excuse this communication                                                   of sentiments. which
