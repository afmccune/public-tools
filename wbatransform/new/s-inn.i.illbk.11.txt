       The Little Girl Lost
    In futurity
 I prophetic see.
 That the earth from sleep,
 (Grave the sentence deep)
    Shall arise and seek
 For her maker meek:
 And the desart wild
 Become a garden mild.
    In the southern clime,
 Where the summers prime,
 Never fades away;
 Lovely Lyca lay.
    Seven summers old
 Lovely Lyca told,
 She had wanderd long,
 Hearing wild birds song,
    Sweet sleep come to me
 Underneath this tree;
 Do father, mother weep.__
 "Where can Lyca sleep".
    Lost in desart wild
 Is your little child.
 How can Lyca sleep,
 If her mother weep:
    If her heart does ake,
 Then let Lyca wake;
 If my mother sleep,
 Lyca shall not weep.
    Frowning frowning night,
 O'er this desart bright,
 Let thy moon arise.
 While I close my eyes.
    Sleeping Lyca lay;
 While the beasts of prey,
 Come from caverns deep,
 View'd the maid asleep
    The kingly lion stood
 And the virgin view'd,
 Then he gambold round
 O'er the hallowd ground:
     Leopards
