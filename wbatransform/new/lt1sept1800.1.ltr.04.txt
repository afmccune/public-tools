PS. I hope to be Settled in Sussex before the End of September
it is certainly the sweetest country upon the face of the Earth
Dear Generous Cumberland nobly solicitous for a Friends welfare. Behold me
Whom your Friendship has Magnified: Rending the manacles of Londons Dungeon dark
I have rent the black net & escap'd. See My Cottage at Felpham in joy
Beams over the sea, a bright light over France, but the Web & the Veil I have left
Behind me at London resists every beam of light; hanging from heaven to Earth
Dropping with human gore. Lo! I have left it! I have torn it from my limbs
I shake my wings ready to take my flight! Pale, Ghastly pale: stands the City in fear
