AFRICA I will sing you a song of Los, the Eternal Prophet: He sung it to four harps at the tables of Eternity,  In heart-formed Africa. Urizen faded! Ariston shudderd! And thus the Song began Adam stood in the garden of Eden; And Noah on the mountains of Ararat; They saw Urizen give his Laws to the Nations By the hands of the children of Los. African Adam shudderd! Noah faded! black grew the sunny When Rintrah gave Abstract Philosophy to Brama in the East. (Night spoke to the Cloud! Lo these Human form'd spirits in smiling hipocrisy, War Against one another; so let them War on; slaves to the eternal Elements) Noah shrunk beneath the waters:  Abram fled in fires from Chaldea; Moses beheld upon Mount Sinai forms of dark delusion; To Trismegistus, Palamabron gave an abstract Law; To Pythagoras Socrates & Plato, Times rolled on o'er all the sons of Har, time after time  Orc on Mount Atlas howld. chain'd down with the Chain of Jealousy Then Oothoon hoverd over Judah & Jerusalem And Jesus heard her voice (a man of sorrows) he recievd A Gospel from wretched Theotormon,  The human race began to wither. for the healthy built Secluded places, fearing the joys of Love And the disease'd only propagated; So Antamon call'd up Leutha from her valleys of delight: And to Mahomet a loose Bible gave. But in the North, to Odin, Sotha gave a Code of War. Because of Diralada thinking to reclaim his joy.
