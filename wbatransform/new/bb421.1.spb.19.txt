He bringeth down to the Grave & bringeth up
we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as He Is
When I behold the Heavens the work of thy hands the Moon & Stars which thou hast ordained. then I say. What is Man that thou art mindful of him?
 & the Son of Man that thou visitest him
I have heard thee with the hearing of the Ear but now my Eye seeth thee
He that hath seen me hath seen my Father also
 I & my Father are One
If you had known
me ye would
have known my
Father also and
from henceforth
ye know him &
have seen him
Believe me that
I am in the Father
& the Father in me
He that loveth me
shall be loved of
my Father
For he dwelleth in
you & shall be with
 you
 He that loveth
me shall be loved
of my father & I
will love him &
manifest myself
unto him
 And my Father
will love him & we
will come unto him
& make our abode
with him
And the Father
shall give you
Another Comforter
that he may abide
with you for ever
Even the Spirit of
Truth whom the
World Cannot
 recieve
At that day ye shall know that I am in
my Father & you in me & I in you
If ye loved me ye would rejoice
because I said I go unto the Father
