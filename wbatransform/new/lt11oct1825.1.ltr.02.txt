Dear Madam I have had the Pleasure                         to see Mr Linnell set off safe in a very comfortable Coach.                         & I may say I accompa nied him part of the way on his                         Journey in the Coach for we both got in together &                         with another Passenger enterd into Conversation when at length                         we found that we were all three proceeding on our                         Journey. but as I had not paid & did not wish to pay for or                         take so long a Ride. we with some difficulty made the Coachman                         understand that one of his Passengers was unwilling to Go. when he obligingly permitted me to get out to my                         great joy. hence I am now enabled to tell you that I                         hope to see you on Sunday morning as usual which I. could                         not have done if they had taken me to Gloucester Tuesday I am D.r Madam yours Sincerely 11 October 1825William Blake
