is out of Town. I desired it might                         be sent to him immediately
â€˜Our benevolent Lady of Lavants                         Recovery, has given me & my
wife the most heartfelt pleasure.                         hope she may soon be perfectly
restored to the hills & valleys                         of beautiful Sussex which must sadly
