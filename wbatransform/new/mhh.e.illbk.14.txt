The ancient tradition that the world will be con- 
-sumed in fire at the end of six thousand years 
is true. as I have heard from Hell,
For the cherub with his flaming sword is 
hereby commanded to leave his guard at tree of  
life, and when he does, the whole creation will 
be consumed, and appear infinite. and holy 
whereas it now appears finite & corrupt.
This will come to pass by an improvement of 
sensual enjoyment.
But first the notion that man has a body 
distinct from his soul, is to be expunged; this 
I shall do, by printing in the infernal method, by 
corrosives, which in Hell are salutary and me- 
-dicinal, melting apparent surfaces away, and 
displaying the infinite which was hid,
If the doors of perception were cleansed 
every thing would appear to man as it is, in- 
-finite.
For man has closed himself up, till he sees 
all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.
