Particular lady Hesketh & Lord                         Cowper ^ Lady H was a
doubtful chance who almost adord                         her Cousin the poet &
thought him all perfection &                         she writes that she is quite satis
fied with the portraits &                         charmd by the great Head in
particular tho she never could                         bear the original Picture
But I ought to mention                         to you that our present idea
is. To take a house in some                         village further from the Sea
Perhaps Lavant. & in or near                         the road to London for

have a bad opinion of the                         reception he has given to me
But My Wife has undertaken to                         Print the whole number of the
Plates for Cowpers work which she                         does to admiration &
being under my own eye the prints                         are as fine as the French
prints & please every one in                         short I have Got every thing
so under my thumb that it is more                         profitable that things

of how we go on. then fear nothing                         & let my Sister fear nothing
because it appears to me that I am                         now too old & have had
too much experience to be any                         longer imposed upon only
