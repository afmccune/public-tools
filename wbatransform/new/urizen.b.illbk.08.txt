8 12: Los howld in a dismal stupor, Groaning! gnashing! groaning! Till the wrenching apart was healed 13: But the wrenching of Urizen heal'd not Cold, featureless, flesh or clay Rifted with direful changes He lay in a dreamless night 14: Till Los rouz'd his his fires affrighted At the formless unmeasurable  death.
