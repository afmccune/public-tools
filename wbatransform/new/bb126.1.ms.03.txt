3 The Mental Traveller I traveld thro' a Land of Men A Land of Men & Women                         too And heard & saw such                         dreadful things As cold Earth wanderers never                         knew For there the Babe is born in                         joy That was begotten in dire                         woe Just as we Reap in joy the                             fruit Which we in bitter tears did                         Sow And if the Babe is born a                         Boy He's given to a Woman Old Who nails him down upon a                         rock Catches his Shrieks in Cups                         of gold She binds iron thorns around                         his head She pierces both his hands                         & feet She cuts his heart out at his                         side To make it feel both cold                         & heat Her fingers number every                         Nerve Just as a Miser counts his                         gold She lives upon his shrieks                         & cries And She grows young as he                         grows old
