Dear Sir
Your eager expectation                         of hearing from me compells me to
write immediately tho I have not done half the business I wishd
owing to a violent cold which confind me to my bed 3 days &
to my chamber a week. I am now so                         well / thank God / as to
get out & have accordingly                         been to Mr Walkers who is not in town
being at Birmingham where he will                         remain 6 Weeks or 2 Months
I took my Portrait of Romney as                         you desired to shew him. his son
was likewise not at home: but I                         will again call on Mr Walker Junr
& beg him to shew me the Pictures, & make every enquiry of him, If
ou think best :–— MrSanders has one or two large Cartoons, The
Subjects he does not know. they                         are folded up on the top of his work–
—shop the rest he packd up & sent into the North. I shewd your
Letter to Mr John Romney to Mr Flaxman who was                         perfectly
Satisfied with it. I seald & sent it immediately as directed by
by Mr                         Sanders to Kendall. Westmoreland. Mr Sanders                             expects
Mr                         Romney in town soon. Note, Your Letter to Mr J                         Romney
I sent off the morning after I recievd it from you being then in health
I have taken your noble present to                             Mr Rose & left it with
charge to the Servant of Great                         Care the Writing looks very
