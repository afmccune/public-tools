24 But the Wine-press of Los is eastward of Golgonooza, before the Seat Of Satan.  Luvah laid the foundation & Urizen finish'd it in howling woe. How red the sons & daughters of Luvah: here they tread the grapes. Laughing & shouting drunk with odours many fall oerwearied Drownd in the wine is many a youth & maiden: those around Lay them on skins of Tygers & of the spotted Leopard & the Wild Ass Till they revive, or bury them in cool grots, making lamentation. This Wine-press is call'd War on Earth, it is the Printing-Press Of Los; and here he lays his words in order above the mortal brain As cogs are formd in a wheel to turn the cogs of the adverse wheel. Timbrels & violins sport round the Wine-presses; the little Seed; The sportive Root. the Earth-worm, the gold Beetle: the wise Emmet; Dance round the Wine-presses of Luvah: the Centipede is there: The ground Spider with many eyes: the Mole clothed in velvet The ambitious Spider in his sullen web; the lucky golden Spinner; The Earwig armd: the tender Maggot emblem of immortality:  The Flea: Louse: Bug: the Tape-Worm: all the Armies of Disease: Visible or invisible to the slothful vegetating Man. The slow Slug: the Grasshopper that sings & laughs & drinks: Winter comes, he folds his slender bones without a murmur. The cruel Scorpion is there: the Gnat: Wasp: Hornet & the Honey Bee: The Toad & venomous Newt; the Serpent clothd in gems & gold: They throw off their gorgeous raiment: they rejoice with loud jubilee Around the Wine-presses of Luvah. naked & drunk with wine. There is the Nettle that stings with soft down; and there The indignant Thistle: whose bitterness is bred in his milk: Who feeds on contempt of his neighbour: there all the idle Weeds That creep around the obscure places, shew their various limbs. Naked in all their beauty dancingâ€”round the Wine-presses. But in the Wine-presses the Human grapes sing not, nor dance They howl & writhe in shoals of torment; in fierce flames consuming, In chains of iron & in dungeons circled with ceaseless fires. In pits & dens & shades of death: in shapes of torment & woe. The plates & screws & wracks & saws & cords & fires & cisterns The cruel joys of Luvahs Daughters laceratin with knives And whips their Victims & the deadly sport of Luvahs Sons. They dance around the dying, & they drink the howl & groan They catch the shrieks in cups of gold, they hand them to one another: These are the sports of love, & these the sweet delights of amorous play Tears of the grape. the death sweat of the cluster the last sigh  Of the mild youth who listens to the lureing songs of Luvah But Allamanda calld on Earth Commerce. is the Cultivated land Around the City of Golgonooza in the Forests of Entuthon; Here the Sons of Los labour against Death Eternal; through all The Twenty-seven Heavens of Beulah in Ulro Seat of Satan, Which is the False Tongue beneath Beulah: it is the Sense of Touch: The Plow goes forth in tempests & lightnings & the Harrow cruel In blights of the east; the heavy Roller follows in howlings of woe. Urizens sons here labour also; & here are seen the Mills Of Theotormon. on the verge of the Lake of Udan-Adan: These are the starry voids of night & the depth & caverns of earth These Mills are oceans, clouds & waters ungovernable in their fury Here are the stars created & the seeds of all things planted And here the Sun & Moon recieve their fixed destinations But in Eternity the Four Arts: Poetry. Painting. Music, And Architecture which is Science: are the Four Faces of Man. Not so in Time & Space: there Three are shut out, and only Science remains thro Mercy: & by means of Science. the Three Become apparent in Time & Space, in the Three Professions  That Man may live upon Earth till the time of his awaking, And from these Three, Science derives every Occupation of Men. And Science is divided into Bowlahoola & Allamanda. Loud
