3 Five windows light the cavern'd Man; thro' one he breathes the air; Thro' one, hears music of the spheres; thro' one, the eternal vine Flourishes, that he may recieve the grapes; thro' one can look. And see small portions of the eternal world that ever groweth; Thro' one, himself pass out what time he please, but he will not; For stolen joys are sweet, & bread eaten in secret pleasant. So sang a Fairy mocking as he sat on a streak'd Tulip, Thinking none saw him: when he ceas'd I started from the trees: And caught him in my hat as boys knock down a butterfly. How know you this said I small Sir? where did you learn this song Seeing himself in my possession thus he answerd me; My master, I am yours, command me, for I must obey. Then tell me, what is the material world, and is it dead? He laughing answer'd: I will write a book on leaves of flowers, If you will feed me on love-thoughts, & give me now and then A cup of sparkling poetic fancies; so when I am tipsie, I'll sing to you to this soft lute; and shew you all alive The world, when every particle of dust breathes forth its joy. I took him home in my warm bosom: as we went along Wild flowers I gatherd; & he shew'd me each eternal flower: He laugh'd aloud to see them whimper because they were pluck'd. They hover'd round me like a cloud of incense: when I came Into my parlour and sat down, and took my pen to write; My Fairy sat upon the table, and dictated EUROPE.
