16 1 Urizen C.V: Thus the Eternal Prophet was divided Before the death image of Urizen For in changeable clouds and darkness In a winterly night beneath, The Abyss of Los stretch'd immense: And now seen. now obscur'd to the eyes Of Eternals, the visions remote Of the dark seperation appear'd. As glasses discover Worlds In the endless-Abyss of space. So the expanding eyes of Immortals Beheld the dark visions of Los, And the globe of life blood trembling.
