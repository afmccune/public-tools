9 Where I may oft outwatch the Bear
 With thrice great Hermes or unsphear
 The Spirit of Plato to unfold
 What Worlds or what vast regions hold
 The Immortal Mind that has forsook
 Its Mansion in this Fleshly nook
 And of those Spirits that are found
 In Fire, Air, Flood. & Underground
 The Spirit of Plato unfolds his Worlds
to Milton in Contemplation.  The Three
 destinies sit on the Circles of Platos
 Heavens weaving the Thread of Mortal
 Life these Heavens are Venus Jupiter
 & Mars.  Hermes flies before as attending
 on the Heaven of Jupiter The Great Bear
 is seen in the Sky beneath Hermes &
 The Spirits of Fire. Air. Water & Earth
 Surround Miltons Chair
