And the Thirty-two Counties of the Four Provinces of  Ireland
Are thus divided: The Four Counties are in the Four  Camps
Munster South in Reubens Gate. Connaut West in Josephs  Gate
Ulster North in Dans Gate, Leinster East in Judahs  Gate
For Albion in Eternity has Sixteen Gates among his  Pillars
But the Four towards the West were Walled up & the  Twelve
That front the Four other Points were turned Four  Square
By Los for Jerusalems sake & called the Gates of  Jerusalem
Because Twelve Sons of Jerusalem fled successive thro  the Gates
But the Four Sons of Jerusalem who fled not but  remaind
Are Rintrah & Palamabron & Theotormon & Bromion
The Four that remain with Los to gu rd the Western  Wall
And these Four remain to guard the Four Walls of  Jerusalem
Whose foundations remain in the Thirty-two Counties of  Ireland
And in Twelve Counties of Wales, & in the Forty  Counties
Of England & in the Thirty-six Counties of  Scotland
And the names of the Thirty-two Counties of Ireland  are these
Under Judah & Issachar & Zebulun are Lowth  Longford
Eastmeath Westmeath Dublin Kildare Kings County
Queens County Wicklow Catherloh Wexford Kilkenny
And those under Reuben & Simeon & Levi are these

And those under Ephraim Manasseh & Benjamin are  these
Galway Roscommon Mayo Sligo Leitrim
And those under Dan Asher & Napthali are these
Donnegal Antrim Tyrone Fermanagh Armagh  Londonderry
Down Managhan Cavan. These are the Land of Erin
All these Center in London & in Golgonooza, from  whence
They are Created continually East & West & North &  South
And from them are Created all the Nations of the  Earth
Europe & Asia & Africa & America, in fury  Fourfold!
Continually Building. Continually Decaying because of Love & Jealousy
And Thirty-two the Nations; to dwell in Jerusalems  Gates
O Come ye Nations Come ye People Come up to  Jerusalem
Return Jerusalem & dwell together as of old:  Return
Return; O Albion let Jerusalem overspread all  Nations
As in the times of old; O Albion awake! Reuben  wanders
The Nations wait for Jerusalem. they look up for the  Bride
France Spain Italy Germany Poland Russia Sweden  Turkey
Arabia Palestine Persia Hindostan China Tartary  Siberia
Egypt Lybia Ethiopia Guinea Caffraria Negroland  Morocco
Congo Zaara Canada Greenland Carolina Mexico
Peru Patagonia Amazonia Brazil. Thirty-two Nations
And under these Thirty-two Classes of Islands in the  Ocean
All the Nations Peoples & Tongues throughout all the  Earth
And the Four Gates of Los surround the Universe Within  and
Without; & whatever is visible in the Vegetable Earth.  the same
Is visible in the Mundane Shell: reversd in mountain &  vale
And a Son of Eden was set over each Daughter of Beulah  to guard
In Albions Tomb the wondrous Creation; & the Four-fold  Gate
Towards Beulah is to the South Fenelon, Guion,  Teresa,
Whitefield & Hervey. guard that Gate; with all the  gentle Souls
Who guide the great Wine-press of Love; Four precious  stones that
Gate:
Women the comforters of Men become the Tormenters & Punishers
