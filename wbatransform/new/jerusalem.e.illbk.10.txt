Into the Furnaces & into the valleys of the Anvils of  Death
And into the mountains of the Anvils & of the heavy  Hammers
Till he should bring the Sons & Daughters of Jerusalem  to be
The Sons & Daughters of Los that he might protect them  from
Albions dread Spectres: storming, loud, thunderous &  mighty
The Bellows & the Hammers move compell'd by Los's  hand.
And this is the manner of the Sons of Albion in their  strength
They take the Two Contraries which are calld  Qualities, with which
Every Substance is clothed, they name them Good &  Evil
From them they make an Abstract. which is a  Negation
Not only of the Substance from which it is derived
A murderer of its own Body: but also a murderer
Of every Divine Member: it is the Reasoning Power
An Abstract objecting power, that Negatives every  thing
This is the Spectre of Man; the Holy Reasoning  Power
And in its Holiness is closed the Abomination of  Desolation
Therefore Los stands in London building Golgonooza 
Compelling his Spectre to labours mighty; trembling in  fear
The Spectre weeps. but Los unmovd by tears or threats  remains
I must Create a System. or be enslav'd by another  Mans
I will not Reason & Compare: my business is to  Create
So Los, in fury & strength: in indignation & burning  wrath
Shuddring the Spectre howls. his howlings terrify the  night
He stamps around the Anvil, beating blows of stern  despair
He curses Heaven & Earth. Day & Night & Sun & Moon
He curses Forest Spring & River, Desart & sandy  Waste
Cities & Nations, Families & Peoples, Tongues &  Laws
Driven to desperation by Loss terrors & threatning  fears
Los cries, Obey my voice & never deviate from my  will
And I will be merciful to thee: be thou invisible to  all
To whom I make thee invisible, but chief to my own  Children
O Spectre of Urthona: Reason not against their dear  approach
Nor them obstruct with thy temptations of doubt &  despair
O Shame O strong & mighty Shame I break thy brazen  fetters
If thou refuse, thy present torments will seem  southern breezes
To what thou shalt endure if thou obey not my great  will.
The Spectre answer'd. Art thou not ashamd of those thy  Sins
That thou callest thy Children? lo the Law of God  commands
That they be offered upon his Altar; O cruelty &  torment
For thine are also mine! I have kept silent  hitherto.
Concerning my chief delight: but thou hast broken  silence
Now I will speak my mind! Where is my lovely  Enitharmon
O thou my enemy, where is my Great Sin? She is also  thine
I said: now is my grief at worst: incapable of  being
Surpassed: but every moment it accumulates more &  more
It continues accumulating to eternity; the joys of God  advance
For he is Righteous: he is not a Being of Pity &  Compassion
He cannot feel Distress: he feeds on Sacrifice &  Offering:
Delighting in cries & tears & clothed in holiness &  solitude
But my griefs advance also, for ever & ever without  end
O that I could cease to be! Despair! I am Despair
Created to be the great example of horror & agony!  also my
Prayer is vain I called for compassion: compassion  mockd
Mercy & pity threw the grave stone over me & with  lead
And iron, bound it over me for ever: Life lives on  my
Consuming: & the Almighty hath made me his  Contrary
To be all evil. all reversed & for ever dead:  knowing
And seeing life. yet living not; how can I then  behold
And not tremble; how can I be beheld & not abhorrd
So spoke the Spectre shuddring, & dark tears ran down  his shadowy face
Which Los wiped off, but comfort none could give! or  beam of hope
Yet ceasd he not from labouring at the roarings of his  Forge
With iron & brass Building Golgonooza in great  contendings
Till his Sons & Daughters came forth from the  Furnaces
At the sublime Labours for Los. compelld the invisible  Spectre
