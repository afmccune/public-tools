One Mite wrung from the Labrers hands  17
Shall buy & sell the                         Misers Lands
Or if protected from on                         high
Does that whole Nation sell                         & buy
He who mocks the Infants                         Faith
Shall be mock'd in Age & Death
He who shall teach the Child                         to Doubt
The rotting Grave shall neer get out
He who respects the Infants                         faith
Triumphs over Hell &                         Death
The Childs Toys & the Old Mans Reasons
Are the Fruits of the Two                         seasons
The Questioner who sits so                         sly
Shall never know how to                             Reply
He who replies to words of                         Doubt
Doth put the Light of                         Knowledge out
The Strongest Poison ever                         known
Came from Caesars Laurel                         Crown
Nought can deform the Human                         Race
Like to the Armours iron brace
When Gold & Gems adorn                         the Plow
To peaceful Arts shall Envy                         Bow
A Riddle or the Crickets                         Cry
Is to Doubt a fit Reply
The Emmets Inch & Eagles                         Mile
Make Lame Philosophy to                         smile
