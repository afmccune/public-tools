  15 And the Lord God took the  m- -   and put him into the garden to    
  to   dress  an   to keep it    
  16 And the Lord  Cood   commanded the Man saying Of every tree of the    
  garden thou mayest freely eat 
  17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good   a nd evil thou shalt not  
  eat   eat  of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely   
  surely die

    And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field    
    19

  19⁋   that was the name thereof :

 b  east   of the field but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him
  21⁋ And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he    
    slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead 
    thereof   
  22 And of the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a    
    2         
 woman and brought her unto the man
      
  23 And Adam Said This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my   
  flesh she shall be called Woman because she was taken out of man
  24 Therefore shall a man leave Father & mother and shall cleave to his wife.  
 and they twain shall be one flesh  
  25 And they were Both Naked the man &   his  wife & were not ashamed
