My Dr Friend
Lest you should not                         have heard of
the Death of Mr Blake I have written this
to inform you – He died on                         Sunday night at
6 Oclock in a most glorious manner                         He said
He was going to that Country he                         had all his
life wished to see –&                         expressed Himself Happy
hoping for Salvation through Jesus                         Christ —
Just before he died His                         Countenance became
fair – His eyes Brighten'd                         and He burst out into
Singing of the   things he Saw in Heaven
In truthe He Died like a Saint as                         a person
who was standing by Him Observed                         – He is to be
Buryed on Fridayay at 12 in morng Should you
like to go to the Funeral–                         If you should there
