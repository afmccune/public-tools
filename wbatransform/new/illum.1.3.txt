    Burins are held in the palm of the hand (fig. 4) and pushed into the plate and away from the body (fig. 5). To make a curved line, the plate is turned on its leather pad while the burin ploughs straight. Unlike drawing, writing, painting, and etching, engraving is nonautographic and a skill requiring years of training. This is why most painters interested in making prints learned etching, a technique in which one uses a needle like a pen and thus drawing skills already acquired, rather than engraving.
