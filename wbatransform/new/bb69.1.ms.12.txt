12 And may at last my weary Age
 Find out the peaceful Hermitage
 The hairy Gown the mossy Cell
 Where I may sit & rightly spell
 Of every Star that heavn doth shew
 And every Herb that Sips the dew
 Till old Experience do attain
 To somewhat like Prophetic Strain
 Milton in his Old Age sitting in his
 Mossy Cell Contemplating the Constel-
 -lations. Surrounded by the Spirits of the
 Herbs & Flowers. bursts forth into a
 rapturous Prophetic Strain
