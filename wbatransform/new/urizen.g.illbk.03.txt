Chap: I
1. Lo, a shadow of horror is risen
In Eternity! Unknown, unprolific?
Self-closd, all-repelling: what Demon
Hath form'd this abominable void
This soul-shudd'ring vacuum? Some
said
'It is Urizen", But unknown, abstracted
Brooding secret, the dark power hid.
2. Times on times he divided, & measur'd
Space by space in his ninefold darkness
Unseen, unknown: changes appeard
In his desolate mountains rifted furious
By the black winds of perturbation
3. For he strove in battles dire
In unseen conflictions with shapes
Bred from his forsaken wilderness.
Of beast, bird, fish, serpent & element
Combustion. blast, vapour and cloud.
4. Dark revolving in silent activity:
Unseen in tormenting passions;
An activity unknown and horrible;
A self-contemplating shadow.
In enormous labours occupied
5. But Eternals beheld his vast forests:
Age on ages he lay, clos'd, unknown.
Brooding shut in the deep; all avoid
The petrific abominable chaos
6. His cold horrors silent. dark Urizen
Prepar'd; his ten thousands of thunders
Rang'd in gloom'd array stretch. out across
The dread world. & the rolling of wheels
As of swelling seas, sound in his clouds
In his hills of stor'd snows, in his mountains
Of hail & ice; voices of terror.
Are heard, like thunders of autumn,
When the cloud blazes over the harvests
Chap: II.
-tion
1. Earth was not: nor globes of attrac-
The will of the Immortal expanded
Or contracted his all flexible senses,
Death was not, but eternal life sprung
2 The sound of a trumpet the heavens
Awoke & vast clouds of blood roll'd
Round the dim rocks of Urizen so nam'd
That solitary one in Immensity
Shrill the trumpet: & myriads of Eter
-nity
