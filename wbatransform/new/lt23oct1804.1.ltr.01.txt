23rd                             Oct. 1804.
DEAR SIR,
I received your kind                         letter with the note to Mr. Payne, and
have had the cash from him. I                         should have returned my thanks
immediately on receipt of it, but                         hoped to be able to send, before
now, proofs of the two plates, the                             Head of R. and the Shipwreck,
which you shall soon see in a much                         more perfect state. I write
immediately because you wish I                         should do so, to satisfy you that
I have received your kind                         favour.
I take the extreme                         pleasure of expressing my joy at our good
Lady of Lavant's continued                         recovery, but with a mixture of sincere
sorrow on account of the beloved                         Councillor. My wife returns her
heartfelt thanks for your kind                         inquiry concerning her health. She is
surprisingly recovered.                         Electricity is the wonderful cause; the swell-
ing of her legs and knees is                         entirely reduced. She is very near as
free from rheumatism as she was                         five years ago, and we have the
greatest confidence in her perfect                         recovery.
The pleasure of seeing                         another poem from your hands has
truly set me longing (my wife says                         I ought to have said us) with
desire and curiosity; but,                         however, "Christmas is a coming."
Our good and kind                         friend Hawkins is not yet in town—hope
soon to have the pleasure of                         seeing him—with the courage of con-
scious industry, worthy of his                         former kindness to me. For now!
O Glory! and O Delight! I have                         entirely reduced that spectrous
Fiend to his station, whose                         annoyance has been the ruin of my
labours for the last passed twenty                         years of my life. He is the
enemy of conjugal love, and is the                         Jupiter of the Greeks, an iron-
hearted tyrant, the ruiner of                         ancient Greece. I speak with perfect
confidence and certainty of the                         fact which has passed upon me.
Nebuchadnezzar had seven times                         passed over him, I have had
