Chap: IV: -ment                      
1. Los smitten with astonish-
Frightend at the hurtling bones
2; And at the surging sulphure-
-ous
Perturbed Immortal mad raging
3: In whirlwinds & pitch & nitre
Round the furious limbs of Los
4; And Los formed nets & gins
And threw the nets round about
5: He watch'd in shuddring fear
The dark changes & bound every
change
With rivets of iron & brass;
6, And these were the changes 
of Urizen.
