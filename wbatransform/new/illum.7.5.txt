    The printed sheet is registered to the sheet under the plate or marks on that bottom sheet. Because the design is in relief and not below the surface, Blake printed his relief etchings with less pressure, which eliminated overt platemarks and enabled him to print on both sides of the sheet and thereby create books with facing pages, a style of printing he used till 1794, when he began printing on one side of the sheet only.
