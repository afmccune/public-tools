83 Corrupability appears upon thy limbs. and never  more Can I arise and leave thy side, but labour here  incessant Till thy awaking! yet alas I shall forget  Eternity! Against the Patriarchal pomp and cruelty. labouring  incessant I shall become an Infant horror. Enion! Tharmas!  friends Absorb me not in such dire grief: O Albion. my  brother! Jerusalem hungers in the desart; affection to her  children! The scorn'd and contemnd youthful girl, where shall  she fly? Sussex shuts up her Villages. Hants, Devon & Wilts Surrounded with masses of stone in orderd forms.  determine then A form for Vala and a form for Luvah. here on the  Thames Where the Victim nightly howls beneath the Druids  knife; A Form of Vegetation, nail them down on the stems of  Mystery; O when shall the Saxon return with the English his  redeemed brother! O when shall the Lamb of God descend among the  Reprobate! I woo to Amalek to protect my fugitives Amalek  trembles: I call to Canaan & Moab in my night watches, they  mourn: They listen not to my cry, they rejoce among their  warriors Woden and Thor and Friga wholly consume my Saxons: On their enormous Altars built in the terrible  north: From Irelands rocks to Scandinavia Persia and  Tartary: From the Atlantic Sea to the universal Erythrean. Found ye London! enormous City! weeps thy River? Upon his parent bosom lay thy little ones O Land Forsaken. Surrey and Sussex are Enitharmons  Chamber. Where I will build her a Couch of repose & my  pillars Shall surround her in beautiful labyrinths:  Oothoon? Where hides my child? in Oxford hidest thou with  Antamon? In graceful hidings of error: in merciful deceit Lest Hand the terrible destroy his Affection, thou  hidest her: In chaste appearances for sweet deceits of love &  modesty Immingled, interwoven, glistening to the sickening  sight. Let Cambel and her Sisters sit within the Mundane  Shell: Forming the fluctuating Globe according to their  will. According as they weave the little embryon nerves &  veins The Eye. the little Nostrils. & the delicate Tongue &  Ears Of labyrinthine intricacy: so shall they fold the  World That whatever is seen upon the Mundane Shell, the  same Be seen upon the Fluctuating Earth woven by the  Sisters. And sometimes the Earth shall roll in the Abyss &  sometimes Stand in the Center & sometimes stretch flat in the  Expanse. According to the will of the lovely Daughters of  Albion. Sometimes it shall assimilate with mighty  Golgonooza: Touching its summits: & sometimes divided roll  apart. As a beautiful Veil so these Females shall fold &  unfold According to their will the outside surface of the  Earth An outside shadowy Surface superadded to the real                                Surface; Which is unchangeable for ever & ever Amen: so be  it! Separate Albions Sons gently from their Emanations Weaving bowers of delight on the current of infant  Thames Where the old Parent still retains his youth as I  alas! Retain my youth eight thousand and five hundred  years. The labourer of ages in the Valleys of Despair; The land is markd for desolation & unless we plant The seeds of Cities & of Villages in the Human  bosom Albion must be a rock of blood: mark ye the points Where Cities shall remain & where Villages for the  rest: It must lie in confusion till Albions time of  awaking. Place the Tribes of Llewellyn in America for a hiding  place! Till sweet Jerusalem emanates again into Eternity The night falls thick: I go upon my watch: be  attentive: The Sons of Albion go forth; I follow from my  Furnaces: That they return no more: that a place be prepard on  Euphrates Listen to your Watchmans voice: sleep not before the  Furnaces Eternal Death stands at the door, O God pity our  labours. So Los spoke. to the Daughters of Beulah while his  Emanation Like a faint rainbow waved before him in the awful  gloom Of London City on the Thames from Surrey Hills to  Highgate: Swift turn the silver spindles, & the golden weights  play soft And lulling harmonies beneath the Looms, from  Caithness in the north To Lizard-point & Dover in the south: his  Emanation Joy'd in the many weaving threads in bright Cathedrons  Dome Weaving the Web of life for Jerusalem. the Web of  life Down flowing into Entuthons Vales glistens with soft  affections. While Los arose upon his Watch. and down from  Golgonooza Putting on his golden sandals to walk from mountain to  mountain He takes his way, girding himself with gold & in his  hand Holding his iron mace: The Spectre remains  attentive Alternate they watch on night; alternate labour in  day Before the Furnaces labouring. while Los all night  watches The stars rising & setting, & the meteors & terrors of  night. With him went down the Dogs of Leutha at his feet They lap the water of the trembling Thames then follow  swift And thus he heard the voice of Albions daughters on  Euphrates,(-lah Our Father Albions land: O it was a lovely land! & the  Daughters of Beu- Walked up and down in its green mountains: but Hand is  fled Away: & mighty Hyle; & after them Jerusalem is gone,Awake
