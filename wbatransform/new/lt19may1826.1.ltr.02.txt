Dear Sir
I have had another desperate Shivring Fit. it came on
yesterday afternoon after as good a morning as I ever experienced.
It began by a gnawing Pain in the Stomach & soon spread, a
deathly feel all over the limbs which brings on the Shivring fit
when I am forced to go to bed where I contrive to get into a little
Perspiration which takes it quite away It was night when it left me
so I did not get up but just as I was going to rise  this morning
the Shivring fit attacked me again & the pain with its accompanying deathly
feel I got again into a perspiration & was well but so much weakend
that I am still in bed. This intirely prevents me from the pleasure of
seeing you on Sunday at Hampstead as I fear the attack again when I
am away from home
I am dr Sir
Yours Sincerely
Friday Evening
