Little TOM the Sailor And does then the Ocean possess The promising, brave, little youth, Who display'd, in a scene of distress, Such Tenderness, Courage, and Truth? Little Tom is a Cottagers Son; His years not amounting to ten! But the Dawn of his Manhood begun With a Soul like the noblest of Men. In an Hospital, distant from Home, He lost his unfortunate Sire; And his Mother was tempted to roam, But to see that kind Father expire. To depart from her Cottage was hard; To desert the dear dying was worse, Tho'! She had an Ideot to guard, And a sick little Infant to nurse. The brave little Tom tried to chear The Grief that He shudder'd to see: "Go! Mother (He said) without Fear! Go! and leave these poor creatures to me! Go you my sick Father restore! And I will take Care of these two: I will not stir out of the Door, For what without me could they do? I will carefully dress them, and feed. Go you our dear Father to save! I will not desert them indeed:" And Tom kept the promise he gave, But his Mother a Widow came back; Want and Sorrow her Portion must be; And her Heart, on Necessity's Rack, Has sent little Thomas to Sea. O Sea! Thou grand Servant of God! The Children of Britain defend! As a braver the Deck never trod, Little Thomas will find Thee a Friend: And when He's aloft in the Shrouds, If a Storm threats aloud to destroy, His Fathers free Soul, in the Clouds, Will watch o'er the venturous Boy: I hear, when the Tempests appall, That Spirit paternal exclaim "O God! Thou Protector of All! Let me shelter this dear little Frame! A Defender, with Honour, his Due! In the Man may his Country admire! Since the Child was a Guardian so true To the desolate Cot of his Sire." W. Blake Inv Printed for & Sold by the Widow Spicer of Folkstone For the Benefit of her Orphans  October 5, 1800
