10 7 In happy copulation; if in evening mild. wearied with work; Sit on a bank and draw the pleasures of this free born joy. The moment of desire! the moment of desire! The virgin That pines for man; shall awaken her womb to enormous joys In the secret shadows of her chamber; the youth shut up from The lustful joy, shall forget to generate, & create an amorous image In the shadows of his curtains and in the folds of his silent pillow. Are not these the places of religion? the rewards of continence! The self enjoyings of self denial? Why dost thou seek religion? Is it because acts are not lovely, that thou seekest solitude, Where the horrible darkness is impressed with reflections of desire. Father of Jealousy, be thou accursed from the earth! Why hast thou taught my Theotormon this accursed thing? Till beauty fades from off my shoulders darken'd and cast out, A solitary shadow wailing on the margin of non-entity. I cry, Love! Love! Love! happy happy Love! free as the mountain wind! Can that be Love, that drinks another as a sponge drinks water? That clouds with jealousy his nights, with weepings all the day:  To spin a web of age around him, grey and hoary! dark! Till his eyes sicken at the fruit that hangs before his sight. Such is self-love, that envies all! a creeping skeleton With lamplike eyes watching around the frozen marriage bed. But silken nets and traps of adamant will Oothoon spread, And catch for thee girls of mild silver, or of furious gold; I'll lie beside thee on a bank & view their wanton play In lovely copulation bliss on bliss with Theotormon; Red as the rosy morning, lustful as the first born beam, Oothoon shall view his dear delight, nor e'er with jealous cloud  Come in the heaven of generous love; nor selfish blightings bring. Does the sun walk in glorious raiment, on the secret floor
