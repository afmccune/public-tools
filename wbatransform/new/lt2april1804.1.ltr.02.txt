the finest drawings. The twelve                         impressions of each of the plates
which I now send ought to be                         unrolled immediately that you receive
them and put under somewhat to                         press them flat. You should have
had fifteen of each, but I had                         not paper enough in proper order for
printing. There is now in hand a                         new edition of Flaxman's Homer
with additional designs, two of                         which I am now engraving. I am
uneasy at not hearing from Mr.                         Dally, to whom I enclosed Â£15
in a letter a fortnight ago, by                         his desire. I write to him by this post
to inquire about it. Money in                         these times is not to be trifled with.
I have now cleared the way to                         Romney, in whose service I now
enter again with great pleasure,                         and hope soon to show you my zeal
with good effect. Am in hopes                         that Miss Poole is recovered, as you
are silent on that most alarming                         and interesting topic in both your
last letters. God be with you in                         all things. My wife joins me in
this prayer.
I am, dear Sir
Your sincerely                         affectionate,
WILLM. BLAKE.
