Of the Mundane Shell which froze on all sides round  Canaan on
The vast Expanse: where the Daughters of Albion Weave  the Web
Of Ages & Generations. folding & unfolding it, like a  Veil of Cherubim
And sometimes it touches the Earths summits, &  sometimes spreads
Abroad into the Indefinite Spectre, who is the  Rational Power.
Then All the Daughters of Albion became One before  Los: even Vala!
And she put forth her hand upon the Looms in dreadful  howlings
Till she vegetated into a hungry Stomach & a devouring  Tongue.
Her Hand is a Court of Justice. her Feet: two Armies  in Battle
Storms & Pestilence: in her Locks: & in her Loins  Earthquake
And Fire. & the Ruin of Cities & Nations & Families &  Tongues
She cries: The Human is but a Worm, & thou O Male;  Thou art
Thyself Female, a Male: a breeder of Seed: a Son &  Husband: & Lo.
The Human Divine is Womans Shadow, a Vapor in the  summers heat
Go assume Papal dignity thou Spectre, thou Male  Harlot! Arthur
Divide into the Kings of Europe in times remote O  Woman-born
And Woman-nourishd & Woman-educated & Woman-scorn'd!
Wherefore art thou living? said Los. & Man cannot live  in thy presence
Art thou Vala the Wife of Albion O thou lovely  Daughter of Luvah
All Quarrels arise from Reasoning. the secret Murder,  and
The violent Man-slaughter. these are the Spectres  double Cave
The Sexual Death living on accusation of Sin &  Judgment
To freeze Love & Innocence into the gold & silver of  the Merchant
Without Forgiveness of Sin Love is Itself Eternal  Death
Then the Spectre drew Vala into his bosom magnificent  terrific
Glittering with precious stones & gold. with Garments  of blood & fire
He wept in deadly wrath of the Spectre. in self-contradicting agony
Crimson with Wrath & green with Jealousy dazling with  Love
And Jealousy immingled & the purple of the violet  darkend deep
Over the Plow of Nations thundring in the hand of  Albions Spectre
A dark Hermaphrodite they stood frownining upon  Londons River
And the Distaff & Spindle in the hands of Vala with  the Flax of
Human Miseries turnd fierce with the Lives of Men  along the Valley
As Reuben fled before the Daughters of Albion Taxing  the Nations
Derby Peak yawnd a horrid Chasm at the cries of  Gwendolen. & at
The stamping feet of Ragan upon the flaming Treddles  of her Loom
That drop with crimson gore with the Loves of Albion &  Canaan
Opening along the Valley of Rephaim. weaving over the  Caves of Mach
