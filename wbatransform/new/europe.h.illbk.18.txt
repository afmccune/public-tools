Shot from the heights of Enitharmon,
And in the vineyards of red France  appear'd the light of his fury.
The sun glow'd fiery red!
The furious terrors flew around!
On golden chariots raging, with red wheels  dropping with blood; 
The Lions lash their wrathful tails!
The Tigers couch upon the prey & suck the  ruddy tide;
And Enitharmon groans & cries in anguish  and dismay,
Then Los arose his head he reard in snaky  thunders clad:
And with a cry that shook all nature to  the utmost pole,
Call'd all his sons to the strife of  blood.
FINIS
