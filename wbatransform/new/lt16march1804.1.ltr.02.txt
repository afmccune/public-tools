Dear Sir
According to your                         Desire I send proofs of
the Monumental Plates tho as you will percieve they
have not the last touches.                         especially the Plate of the
Monument which I have drawn from                             Mr Flaxmans
Model with all the fidelity I                         could & will finish
with equal care. the writing                         being exactly copied from the
tracing paper which was traced                         on the marble _ The
inscriptions to the Plates I                         must beg of you to
send to me that I may Engrave                         them immediately
The drawing of the                         Monument of which Mr Johnson sent
has the following Inscription                         _"Monument Erected"
"to the Memory of William Cowper                             Esq.re in"
"St                         Edmunds Chapel. East Dereham by the Lady"
"Hesketh 1803"_ But it strikes                         me that. St
Edmunds Chapel East Dereham may                         be understood to
mean a Chapel in East Dereham                             Town. & not to
Express sufficiently, that the                         Monument is in East Dereham Church.
