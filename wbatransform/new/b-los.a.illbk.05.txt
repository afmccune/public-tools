An immense Fibrous form, stretching out
Thro' the bottoms of immensity raging.
5: He rose on the floods: then he smote
The wild deep with his terrible wrath,
Seperating the heavy and thin.
6: Down the heavy sunk; cleaving around
To the fragments of solid; up rose
The thin, flowing round the fierce fires
That glow'd furious in the expanse.
Chap: IV:
1: Then Light first began; from the fires
Beams, conducted by fluid so pure
Flow'd around the Immense: Los beheld
Forthwith writhing upon the dark void
The Back bone of Urizen appear
Hurtling upon the wind
Like a serpent! like an iron chain
Whirling about in the Deep.
2: Upfolding his Fibres together
To a Form of impregnable strength
Los astonish'd and terrified, built
Furnaces; he formed an Anvil
A Hammer of adamant then began
The binding of Urizen day and night
3: Circling round the dark Demon, with 
howlings
Dismay & sharp blightings; the Prophet
Of Eternity beat on his iron links
4: And first from those infinite fires
The light that flow'd down on the winds
He siez'd; beating incessant, condensing
The subtil particles in an Orb.
5: Roaring indignant the bright sparks
Endur'd the vast Hammer; but unwearied
Los beat on the Anvil; till glorious
An immense Orb of fire he fram'd
6: Oft he quench'd it beneath in the
Deeps.
Then surveyd the all bright mass: Again
Siezing fires from the terrific Orbs
He heated the round Globe, then beat
While roaring his Furnaces endur'd
The chaind Orb in their infinite wombs
7: Nine ages completed their circles
When Los heated the glowing mass, cast-
-ing
It down into the Deeps: the Deeps fled
Away in redounding smoke; the Sun
Stood self-balanc'd. And Los smild 
with joy.
He the vast Spine of Urizen siez'd
And bound down to the glowing illusion
8: But no light. for the Deep fled away
On all sides. and left an unform'd
Dark vacuity; here Urizen lay
In fierce torments on his glowing bed
9: Till his Brain in a rock, & his Heart
In a fleshy slough formed four rivers
Obscuring the immense Orb of fire
Flowing down into night: till a Form
Was completed. a Human Illusion
In darkness and deep clouds involvd.
