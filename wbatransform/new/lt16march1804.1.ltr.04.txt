Compliments.)(which you will                         find inclosed) one is a copy from
that Miniature; you kindly sufferd me to make, from the Picture
of Romney which I am now                             Engraving; & which was lent by
Mr                         Long for the purpose of being Engraved for the European Magne
The other is Mrs Siddons from the Picture by Romney in
Mr                         Braithwaites possession but as much unlike the original
as possible.
My Wife joins me in                         best Affections to you
& I remain                         Sincerely Yours
