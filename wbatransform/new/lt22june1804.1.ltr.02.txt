Dear Sir
I have got the three                         Sublime Designs of Romney
now in my Lodgings & find                         them all too Grand as well as
too undefined for meer outlines, & indeed it is not only my
opinion but that of Mr Flaxman & Mr                         Parker both of whom
I have consulted that to give a                         true Idea of Romneys Genius
nothing less than Some Finishd Engravings will do. as Outline
intirely omits his chief beauties. but there are some which may
be Executed in a slighter manner                         than others. & Mr Parker
whose Eminence as an Engraver makes his opinion deserve                                 notice
has                         advised. that 4 should be done in the highly finished
manner & 4 in a less Finishd _ & on my desiring him
to tell me for what he Would                         undertake to Engrave One in
Each manner the size to be about                         7 Inches by 5 Â¼ which is
the size of a Quarto printed                         Page. he answerd. 30 Guineas
the finishd. & half the sum for the less finishd. but as you
tell me that they will be wanted                         in November I am of opinion
that if Eight different Engravers                         are Employd the Eight Plates
will not be done by that time. as                         for myself (Note
Parker now speaks) I have today                         turned away a Plate of
of work
400 Guineas because I am too                             full^ to undertake it, &
