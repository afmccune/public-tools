To cut off the bread from the city,
That the remnant may learn to obey.
That the pride of the heart may fail;
That the lust of the eyes may be quench'd, 
That the delicate ear in its infancy
May be dull'd; and the nostrils clos'd up, 
To teach mortal worms the path
That leads from the gates of the Grave.
Urizen heard them cry;
And his shudd'ring waving wings
Went enormous above the red flames
Drawing clouds of despair thro' the heavens
Of Europe as he went; 
And his Books of brass iron & gold
Melted over the land as he flew,
Heavy-waving, howling, weeping.
And he stood over Judea, 
And stay'd in his ancient place; 
And stretch'd his clouds over Jerusalem, 
For Adam, a mouldering skeleton
Lay bleach'd on the garden of Eden; 
And Noah as white as snow
On the mountains of Ararat, 
Then the thunders of Urizen bellow'd aloud
From his woven darkness above. 
Orc raging in European darkness
Arose like a pillar of fire above the Alps
Like a serpent of fiery flame!
The sullen Earth
Shrunk! 
Forth from the dead dust rattling bones to bones
Join: shaking convuls'd the shivring clay breathes, 
And all flesh naked stands; Fathers and Friends;
Mothers & Infants; Kings & Warriors;
The Grave shrieks with delight, & shakes
Her hollow womb, & clasps the solid stem;
Her bosom swells with wild desire;
And milk & blood & glandous wine,
In rivers rush & shout & dance,
On mountain, dale and plain, 
The SONG of LOS is Ended. 
Urizen Wept.
