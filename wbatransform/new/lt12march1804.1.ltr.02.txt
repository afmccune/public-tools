Dear Sir
I begin with the latter end of your letter &
grieve more for Miss Pooles ill health than for my
failure in sending proofs tho I am verry sorry that
I cannot send before Saturdays Coach. Engraving
is Eternal work. the two plates are almost finishd 
You will recieve proofs of them for Lady Hesketh. whose
copy of Cowpers letters ought to be printed in
tters of Gold & ornamented with Jewels of Heaven
Havilah Eden & all the countries where Jewels abound
I curse & bless Engraving alternately because it
takes so much time & is so untractable. tho
capable of such beauty & perfection.
My wife desires with me to Express her
Love to you Praying for Miss Pooles perfect
recovery & we both remain
March 12 Your Affectionate
1804 Will Blake
