for we have Sold all that we have                         had time to print. Evans
the Bookseller in Pallmall says                         they go off very well & why
should we repent of having done                         them it is doing Nothing
that is to be repented of &                         not doing such things as these
Pray remember us both                         to Mr Hall when you see him
I write in great haste                         & with a head full of botheration
about various projected works                         & particularly. a work now
Proposed to the Public at the End                         of Cowpers Life. which
will very likely be of great                         consequence it is Cowpers
Milton the same that Fuselis Milton Gallery was
painted for, & if we succeed                         in our intentions the
prints to this work will be very                         profitable to me &
not only profitable but honourable                         at any rate The
Project pleases Lord Cowpers                         family. & I am now
labouring in my thoughts Designs                         for this & other
works equally creditable These are                         works to be boasted
of & therefore I cannot feel depressd tho I know that
as far as Designing & Poetry                         are concernd I am Envied
in many Quarters. but I will cram                         the dogs for I
know that the Public are my                         friends & love my works &
will embrace them whenever they                         see them My only Dif
-ficulty is to produce fast                         enough.
I go on Merrily with my                         Greek & Latin. am very
sorry that I did not begin to                         learn languages early in life
as I find it very Easy. am now                         learning my Hebrew. א ב ג
I read Greek as fluently as an                         Oxford scholar & the Testament
is my chief master astonishing                         indeed is the English Translation
it is almost word for word &                         if the Hebrew Bible is as well
translated which I do not doubt it                         is we need not doubt of
its having been translated as well                         as written by the Holy Ghost
my wife joins me in Love to you                         both I am Sincerely yours
