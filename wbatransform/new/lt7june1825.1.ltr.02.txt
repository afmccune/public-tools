Dear Sir
I return you thanks for The Two Pounds you now send me
As to Sr T. Lawrence I have not heard from him as yet, & hope that
he has a good opinion of my willingness to appear grateful tho not
able on account of this abominable Ague or whatever it is I am in Bed
& at Work my health I cannot speak of for if it was not for th Cold
weather I think I should soon get about again. Great Men die equaly
with the little. I am sorry for L.d L.- he is a man of very singular abilities 
as also for the D of C but perhaps & I verily believe it Every Death is
an improvement of the State of the Departed. I can draw as well a Bed
as Up & perhaps better but I cannot Engrave I am going on with Dante
& please myself.
I am dr Sir yours Sincerely
