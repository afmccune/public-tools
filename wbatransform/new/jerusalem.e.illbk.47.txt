From Camberwell to Highgate where the mighty Thames shudders along.
Where Los's Furnaces stand, where Jerusalem & Vala howl;
Luvah tore forth from Albions Loins. in fibrous veins. in rivers
Of blood over Europe: a Vegetating Root in grinding pain.
Animating the Dragon Temples, soon to become that Holy Fiend
The Wicker Man of Scandinavia in which cruelly consumed
The Captives reard to heaven howl in flames among the stars
Loud the cries of War on the Rhine & Danube. with Albions Sons,
Away from Beulahs hills & vales break forth the Souls of the Dead.
With cymbal, trumpet, clarion; & the scythed chariots of Britain.
And the Veil of Vala, is composed of the Spectres of the Dead
Hark! the mingling cries of Luvah with the Sons of Albion.
Hark! & Record the terrible wonder! that the Punisher
Mingles with his Victims Spectre. enslaved and tormented
To him whom he has murderd, bound in vengeance & enmity
Shudder not. but Write. & the hand of God will assist you!
Therefore I write Albions last words. Hope is banish'd from me.
