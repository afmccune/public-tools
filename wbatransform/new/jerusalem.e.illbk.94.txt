Albion cold lays on his Rock: storms & snows beat  round him
Beneath the Furnaces & the starry Wheels & the  Immortal Tomb
Howling winds cover him: roaring seas dash furious  against him
In the deep darkness broad lightnings glare long  thunders roll
The weeds of Death inwrap his hands & feet blown  incessant
And washd incessant by the for-ever restless sea-waves  foaming abroad
Upon the white Rock. England a Female Shadow as deadly  damps
Of the Mines of Cornwall & Derbyshire lays upon his  bosom heavy
Moved by the wind in volumes of thick cloud returning  folding round
His loins & bosom unremovable by swelling storms &  loud rending
Of enraged thunders. Around them the Starry Wheels of  their Giant Sons
Revolve: & over them the Furnaces of Los & the  Immortal Tomb around
Erin sitting in the Tomb. to watch them unceasing  night and day
And the Body of Albion was closed apart from all  Nations.
Over them the famishd Eagle screams on boney Wings and  around
Them howls the Wolf of famine deep heaves the Ocean  black thundering
Around the wormy Garments of Albion: then pausing in  deathlike silence
Time was Finished! The Breath Divine Breathed over  Albion
Beneath the Furnaces & starry Wheels and in the  Immortal Tomb
And England who is Brittannia awoke from Death on  Albions bosom
She awoke pale & cold she fainted seven times on the  Body of Albion
O pitious Sleep O pitious Dream! O God O God awake I  have slain
In Dreams of Chastitity & Moral Law I have Murdered  Albion! Ah!
In Stone-henge & on London Stone & in the Oak Groves  of Malden
I have Slain him in my Sleep with the Knife of the  Druid O England
O all ye Nations of the Earth behold ye the Jealous  Wife
The Eagle & the Wolf & Monkey & Owl & the King &  Priest were there
