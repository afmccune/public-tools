14  Shudders Hell                         thro all its regions
A dog starvd at his Masters Gate
Predicts the ruin of the                         State
A Horse misusd upon the Road
Calls to Heaven for Human                         blood
Each outcry of the hunted                         Hare
A fibre from the Brain does                         tear
A Skylark wounded in the wing                             
A Cherubim does cease to                         sing
The Game Cock clipd & armd for fight
Does the Rising Sun                             affright
Every Wolfs & Lions                         howl
Raises from Hell a Human                         Soul
The wild deer wandring here & there
Keeps the Human Soul from                         Care
The Lamb misusd breeds Public strife 
And yet forgives the Butchers                         Knife
The Bat that flits at close                         of Eve
Has left the Brain that wont                         Believe
The Owl that calls upon the Night 
Speaks the Unbelievers                         fright
He who shall hurt the little                         Wren
Shall never be belovd by Men
