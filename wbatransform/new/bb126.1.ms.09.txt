In the Morning the Villagers                         rose with delight  9
And repeated with pleasure                         the joys of the night
And Mary arose among Friends                         to be free
But no Friend from                         henceforward thou Mary shalt see
Some said she was proud some calld her a whore 
And Some when she passed by                         shut to the door 
A damp cold came oer her blushes all fled
Her lillies & roses are                         blighted & shed
O why was I born with a                         different Face
Why was I not born like this Envious Race 
Why did Heaven adorn me with                         bountiful hand
And then set me down in an                         envious Land
To be weak as a Lamb &                         smooth as a dove
And not to raise Envy is calld Christian Love
But if you raise Envy your                         Merits to blame
For planting such spite in                         the weak & the tame
I will humble my Beauty I                         will not dress fine
I will keep from the Ball                         & my Eyes shall not shine
And if any Girls Lover                         forsakes her for me
I'll refuse him my hand &                         from Envy be free 
She went out in Morning attird plain & neat
Proud Marys gone Mad said the                         Child in the Street
She went out in Morning in                         plain neat attire
And came home in Evening bespatterd with mire
