1:st Samuel 28:th ch: v. 12:th to 21.st
And Saul said to the woman, bring me up Samuel.  And when the woman saw Samuel, she
cried with a loud voice, & spake to Saul, saying, why hast thou deceived me?  for thou art Saul.  And the king
said unto her, be not afraid, for what sawest thou?  And the woman said unto Saul, I saw Gods ascending
out of the earth.  And he said unto her, what form is he of?  and she said, an old man cometh up, & and he is
covered with a mantle; And Saul perceived that it was Samuel & bowed himself to the ground.  And
Samuel said unto Saul, why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up.?  And Saul answered, I am sore
distressed for the Philistenes war against me & God is departed from me & answereth me no more; therefore I have
called thee that thou mayest make known unto me what I am to do.  Then said Samuel wherefore then asketh thou
of me, seeing the Lord hath departed from thee, & done as he spake by me for the Lord hath given thy kingdom to thy
neighbour David because thou obeydst not the voice of the Lord.  Moreover the Lord will also deliver Israel with
thee into the hands of the Philistines & to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me.
