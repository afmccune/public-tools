What! shall we recieve Good
at the hand of God & shall we not also
recieve Evil
And when they lifted up their eyes afar off & knew him not
they lifted up their voice & wept. & they rent every Man his
mantle & sprinkled dust upon their heads towards heaven
Ye have heard of the Patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord.
