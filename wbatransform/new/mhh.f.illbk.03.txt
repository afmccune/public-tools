As a new heaven is begun, and it is now thir- 
-ty-three years since its advent: the Eternal Hell 
revives. And lo! Swedenborg is the Angel sitting 
at the tomb; his writings are the linen clothes folded 
up. Now is the dominion of Edom, & the return of 
Adam into Paradise; see Isaiah XXXIV & XXXV Chap:
Without Contraries is no progression. Attraction 
and Repulsion, Reason and Energy, Love and 
Hate, are necessary to Human existence.
From these contraries spring what the religious call 
Good & Evil. Good is the passive that obeys Reason 
Evil is the active springing from Energy.
Good is Heaven. Evil is Hell,
