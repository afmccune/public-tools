never may. I have no Curiosity                         to see him as I well know
what is within the compass of a                         boy of 14. & as to Real Acting
it is Like Historical Painting                         No Boys Work
Fuseli is made Master                         of the Royal Academy. Banks the
Sculptor is Gone to his Eternal                         House. I have heard that
Flaxman means to give a Lecture                         on Sculpture at the
Royal Academy on the Occasion of                         Banks's Death
he died at the Age of 75 of a                         Paralytic Stroke. Now

I must not omit to                         tell you that on leaving Mr Phillips
I askd if he had any Message to you as I meant to write

to this in the course of our                         Conversation. his words were
I feel somewhat Embarrasd at the Idea of setting a
value on any work of Mr Hayleys & fear that he will
wish me to do so_ I asked him                         how a Value was set
on any Literary work he answerd The Probable sale of
the work would be the measure of                         Estimating the Profits
& that would lead to a                         Valuation of the Copy right_
This may be of no Consequence.                         but I could not omit
telling it you
My Wife Continues in                         health & desires
to join me in every Grateful                         Wish to you &
