But I wander on the rocks
With hard necessity.
6: Where is my golden palace
Where my ivory bed
Where the joy of my morning hour
Where the sons of eternity. singing
7: To awake bright Urizen my king:
To arise to the mountain sport,
To the bliss of eternal valleys:
8: To awake my king in the morn:
To embrace Ahanias joy
On the breath of his open bosom:
From my soft cloud of dew to fall
In showers of life on his harvests.
9: When he gave my happy soul
To the sons of eternal joy:
When he took the daughters of life.
Into my chambers of love:
10: When I found babes of bliss on my beds.
And bosoms of milk in my chambers
Fill'd with eternal seed
O! eternal births sung round Ahania
In interchange sweet of their joys.
11: Swell'd with ripeness & fat with fatness
Bursting on winds my odors.
My ripe figs and rich pomegranates
In infant joy at thy feet
O Urizen sported and sang;
12: Then thou with thy lap full of seed
With thy hand full of generous fire
Walked forth from the clouds of morning
On the virgins of springing joy,
On the human soul to cast
The seed of eternal science,
13: The sweat poured down thy temples
To Ahania return'd in evening
The moisture awoke to birth
My mothers-joys, sleeping in bliss.
14: But now alone over rocks. mountains
Cast out from thy lovely bosom:
Cruel jealousy: selfish fear!
Self-destroying: how can delight.
Renew in these chains of darkness
Where bones of beasts are strown
On the bleak and snowy mountains
Where bones from the birth are buried
Before they see the light.
