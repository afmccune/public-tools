Dear Sir
This Morning I have been with Mr Phillips & have
intirely settled with him the plan of Engraving for the new Edition
of the Ballads_ The Prints 5 in Number I have Engaged
to finish by 28 May. they are to be as highly finishd as I can
do them the Size the same as the Serena plates the Price 20 Guineas Each
half to be paid by P_ The Subjects I cannot do better than those
already chosen. as they are the most eminent among Animals Viz
The Lion. The Eagle. The Horse. The Dog. Of the Dog Species
the Two Ballads are so preeminent & my Designs for them please me
so well that I have chosen that design in our Last Number of the
dead
Dog & Crocodile. & that of the Dog defending his ^ Master from the Vultures
of these five I am making little high finishd Pictures the size the
Engravings are to be. & am hard at it to accomplish in time what
I intend. Mr P_ says he will send Mr Seagrave the Paper directly
The Journeyman Printers throughout London are at War with
their Masters & are likely to get the better Each Party meet to
consult against the other, nothing can be greater than the Violence
on both sides Printing is suspended in London Except at private
Presses. I hope this will become a source of Advantage to our
Friend Seagrave
The Idea of Seeing an Engraving of Cowper by the
hand of Caroline Watson is I assure you a pleasing one to me
it will be highly gratifying to see another Copy by another hand
& not only gratifying but Improving. which is better
