11 My bones are pierced in me in the night season & my sinews take no rest My skin is black upon me & my bones are burned with heat The triumphing of the wicked is short, the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment Satan himself is transformed into an Angel of Light & his Ministers into Ministers of Righteousness With Dreams upon my bed thou scarest me & affrightest me with Visions Why do you persecute me as God & are not satisfied with my flesh. Oh that my words were printed in a Book that they were graven with an iron pen & lead in the rock for ever For I know that my Redeemer liveth & that he shall stand in the latter days upon the Earth & after my .skin destroy thou This body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for Myselfand mine eyes shall behold & not Anothertho consumed by my wrought Image Who opposeth & exalteth himself above all that is called God or is Worshipped WBlake invenit & sculp London.
