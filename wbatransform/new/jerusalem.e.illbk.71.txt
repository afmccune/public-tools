And above Albions Land was seen the Heavenly  Canaan
As the Substance is to the Shadow: and above Albions  Twelve Sons
Were seen Jerusalems Sons: and all the Twelve Tribes spreading
Over Albion. As the Soul is to the Body, so Jerusalems  Sons,
Are to the Sons of Albion: and Jerusalem is Albions  Emanation
What is Above is Within. for every-thing in Eternity  is translucent! 
The Circumference is Within: Without, is formed the  Selfish Center 
And the Circumference still expands going forward to  Eternity.
And the Center has Eternal States! these States we now  explore.
And these the Names of Albions Twelve Sons. & of his  Twelve Daughters
With their Districts. Hand dwelt in Selsey & had  Sussex & Surrey
And Kent & Middlesex: all their Rivers & their Hills.  of flocks & herds:
Their Villages Towns Cities Sea-Ports Temples sublime  Cathedrals;
All were his Friends & their Sons & Daughters  intermarry in Beulah
For all are Men in Eternity. Rivers Mountains Cities  Villages.
All are Human & when you enter into their Bosoms you  walk
In Heavens & Earths; as in your own Bosom you bear  your Heaven
And Earth, & all you behold, tho it appears Without it  is Within
In your Imagination of which this World of Mortality  is but a Shadow.
Hyle dwelt in Winchester comprehending Hants Dorset  Devon Cornwall.
Their Villages Cities Sea Ports. their Corn fields &  Gardens spacious
Palaces. Rivers & Mountains. and between Hand & Hyle  arose
Gwendolen & Cambel who is Boadicea: they go abroad &  return
Like lovely beams of light from the mingled affections  of the Brothers
The Inhabitants of the whole Earth rejoice in their  beautiful light.
Coban dwelt in Bath. Somerset Wiltshire  Gloucestershire,
Obeyd his awful voice Ignoge is his lovely  Emanation;
She adjoind with Gwantokes Children, soon lovely  Cordella arose.
Gwantoke forgave & joyd over South Wales & all its  Mountains.
Peachey had North Wales Shropshire Cheshire & the Isle  of Man.
His Emanation is Mehetabel terrible & lovely upon the  Mountains
Brertun had Yorkshire Durham Westmoreland & his  Emanation
Is Ragan, she adjoind to Slade, & produced Gonorill  far beaming.
Slade had Lincoln Stafford Derby Nottingham & his  lovely
Emanation Gonorill rejoices over hills & rocks & woods  & rivers.
Huttn had Warwick Northampton Bedford Buckingham
Leicester & Berkshire; & his Emanation is Gwinefred  beautiful
Skofeld had Ely Rutland Cambridge Huntingdon  Norfolk
Suffolk Hartford & Essex; & his Emanation is  Gwinevera
Beautiful, she beams towards the east. all kinds of  precious stones
And pearl, with instruments of music in holy  Jerusalem
Kox had Oxford Warwick Wilts: his Emanation is  Estrild;
Joind with Cordella she shines southward over the  Atlantic.
Kotope had Hereford Stafford Worcester, & his  Emanation
Is Sabrina joind with Mehetabel she shines west over  America
Bowen had all Scotland. the Isles, Northumberland &  Cumberland
His Emanation is Conwenna, she shines a triple  form
Over the north with pearly beams gorgeous &  terrible
Jerusalem & Vala rejoice in Bowen & Conwenna,
But the Four Sons of Jerusalem that never were  Generated
Are Rintrah and Palamabron and Theotormon and Bromion.  They
Dwell over the Four Provinces of Ireland in heavenly  light
The Four Universities of Scotland, & in Oxford &  Cambridge & Winchester
But now Albion is darkened & Jerusalem lies in  ruins:
Above the Mountains of Albion. above the head of  Los.
And Los shouted with ceaseless shoutings & his tears  poured down
His immortal cheeks, rearing his hands to heaven for  aid Divine!
But he spoke not to Albion: fearing lest Albion should  turn his Back
Against the Divine Vision: & fall over the Precipice  of Eternal Death.
But he receded before Albion & before Vala weaving the  Veil
With the iron shuttle of War among the rooted Oaks of  Albion;
Weeping & shouting to the Lord day & night; and his  Children
Wept round him as a flock silent Seven Days of  Eternity
