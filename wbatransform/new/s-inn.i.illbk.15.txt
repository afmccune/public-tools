       Nurse's Song
    When the voices of children are heard on the green
 And laughing is heard on the hill,
 My heart is at rest within my breast
 And every thing else is still
    Then come home my children, the sun is gone down
 And the dews of night arise
 Come come leave off play, and let us away
 Till the morning appears in the skies
    No no let us play, for it is yet day
 And we cannot go to sleep
 Besides in the sky, the little birds fly
 And the hills are all coverd with sheep
    Well well go & play till the light fades away
 And then go home to bed
 The little ones leaped & shouted & laugh'd
 And all the hills ecchoed
