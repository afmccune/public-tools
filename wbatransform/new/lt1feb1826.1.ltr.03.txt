I call Presumption & Folly I                         have tried it too much not to know this & am very sorry for all                         such who may be led to such ostentatious Exertion against their Eternal                         Existence itself because it is Mental Rebellion against the Holy Spirit                         & fit only for a Soldier of Satan to perform Though I hope in a                         morning or two to call on you in Cirencester Place I feared you might be gone or I might be too ill to let you know how I am & what I wish I am dear Sir Feby 1. 1826Yours Sincerely William Blake
