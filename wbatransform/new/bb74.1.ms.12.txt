Or if she's deaf or is wall                   eyed
Yet if her heart is well                   inclined
Some tender lover she shall                   find
That panteth for a Bride 

The universal Poultice this
To cure whatever is amiss
In damsel or in Widow                      gay
It makes them smile it makes them                   skip
Like Birds just cured of the                   pip
They chirp & hop away

Then come ye Maidens come ye                      Swains
Come & be eased of all your                   pains
In Matrimony's Golden cage __
I  Go &                   be hanged said Scopprel how can you have the face 
to make game of Matrimony â€“  
 

Then Quid  calld upon Obtuse Angle for a Song & he wiping his face
& looking on the corner of the  cieling Sang
To be or not to be
Of great capacity
Like Sir Isaac Newton
Or Locke or Doctor South
Or Sherlock upon death
Id rather be Sutton
For he did build a house
For aged men & youth 
With walls of brick & stone
He  furnishd it within
With whatever he could win
And all his own
He drew out of the Stocks
His money in a box
And sent his servant
To Green the Bricklayer
And to the Carpenter
He was so fervent
The chimneys were three score
The windows many more 
And for convenience
He sinks & gutters made
And all the way he  pavd
To hinder pestilence
Was not this a good man
Whose life was but a span
Whose name was Sutton
