No No let us play for it is yet day
 go to
And we cannot  sleep 

in
Besides the Sky the little birds fly
And the meadows are  coverd with Sheep
Well Well go & play till the light fades away
And then go home to bed
The little ones leaped & shouted &  laughd
And all the hills  ecchoed
Then  Sung Quid
O father father where are you going 
O do not walk so fast
O speak father speak to your little boy
Or else I shall be lost
The night it was dark & no father was there
And the child was wet with dew
The mire was deep & the child did weep
And away the vapour flew
Here nobody could sing any longer. till Tilly Lally  pluckd up a
spirit & he sung.
O I say you Joe
Throw us the ball
Ive a good mind to go
And leave you all
I never saw saw such a bowler
To bowl the ball in a  tansey
And to clean it with my handkercher
Without saying a word
That Bills a foolish fellow

He has given me a black eye
He does not know how to handle a bat
dog or a
Any more than a  cat
He has  knockd down the wicket
And broke the stumps
And runs without shoes to save his pumps
Here a laugh began and Miss Gittipin sung
Leave O leave to my sorrows
Here  Ill sit & fade away 
Till  Im nothing but a spirit 
And I lose this form of clay
