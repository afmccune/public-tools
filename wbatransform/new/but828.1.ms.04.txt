 of heaven

 the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl
 after his kind. and God saw that it was good.

  the waters in the seas & let fowl multiply in the earth. 
 23  And the evening and the morning were the fifth day    
 24  And God said. Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his 
    kind cattle & cree  ping   thing & beast of the earth after his kind 
 and it was so.
