     Rev. ns ch: 13 th v. 11: th & 12: th
 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two
 horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exerciseth all the powers
 of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth & them which dwell therein to
 worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
