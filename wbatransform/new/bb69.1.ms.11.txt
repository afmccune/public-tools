11 There in close Covert by some Brook
 When no profaner Eye may look
 With such concert as they keep
 Entice the dewy featherd Sleep
 And let some strange mysterious dream
 Wave on his Wings in airy stream
 Of liveliest Portraiture displayd
 On my Sleeping eyelids laid
 And as I wake sweet Music breathe
 Above; about: or underneath
 Sent by some Spirit to Mortals good
 Or the unseen Genius of the Wood
 Milton Sleeping on a Bank. Sleep
descending with a Strange mysterious
dream upon his Wings of Scrolls & 
Nets & Webs unfolded by Spirits in the
Air & in the Brook around Milton
are Six Spirits or Fairies hovering on the
Air with Instruments of Music
