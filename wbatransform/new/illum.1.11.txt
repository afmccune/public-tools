    In his 22 Illustrations of the Book of Job engravings, published in 1826, Blake reproduced his own designs and, hence, as artist and engraver produced what was understood as original rather than reproductive prints. He returned to the earliest style of engraving, to the pure engraving practiced by his heroes, Albrecht Durer and Marcantonio Raimondi. The lines, engraved directly into the plate without preliminary etching, are densely laid in a parallel rather than cross-hatched style, as evinced by the detail of plate 12. Essick Collection.
