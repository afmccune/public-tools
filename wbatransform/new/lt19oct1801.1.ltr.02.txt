for ever & ever. The Reign of Literature & the Arts Commences
Blessed are those who are found Studious of Literature & Humane &
polite accomplishments. such have their lamps burning & such shall
shine as the stars

honourable mention of me. has been at Felpham & did me the favor
to call on me. I have promisd to send my designs for Comus
when I have done them directed to you
Now I hope to see the Great Works of Art as they are
so near to Felpham Paris being scarce further off than London.
But I hope that France & England will henceforth be as One Country
and their Arts One & that you will Ere long be erecting Monuments
In Paris Emblems of Peace
