Dear Sir
I thank you for the Ten                         Pounds you are so kind
as to send me at this time. My                         journey to Hamptd on
Sunday brought on a relapse which                         is lasted till now. I find
I am notso well as I thought I must not go on in a youthful 
Style however I am upon the                         mending hand to day & hope
soon to look as I did for I have                         been yellow accompanied by
all the old Symptoms
I am dear Sir
Yours Sincerly
