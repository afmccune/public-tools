now for ever fallen into the Abyss. God bless & preserve You
& our Good Lady Paulina with the Good things both of this
life & of eternity & with you my much admired & respected 
Edward the Bard of Oxford whose verses still sound upon
my Ear like the distant approach of things mighty & magnificent
like the sound of harps which I hear before the Suns rising
like the remembrance of Felphams waves & of the Glorious
& far beaming Turret, like the Villa of Lavant
blessed & blessing Amen God bless you all O
people of Sussex arond your Hermit & Bard So prays
the Emulator of both his & your mild & happy tempers
of Soul your devoted
