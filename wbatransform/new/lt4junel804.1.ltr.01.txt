June 4th, 1805.
DEAR SIR,
I have fortunately, I ought to say providentially, discovered
that I have engraved one of the plates for that ballad of The Horse
which is omitted in the new edition; time enough to save the extreme
loss and disappointment which I should have suffered had the work
been completed without that ballad's insertion. I write to entreat
that you would contrive so as that my plate may come into the work,
as its ommission would be to me a loss that I could not now sustain
