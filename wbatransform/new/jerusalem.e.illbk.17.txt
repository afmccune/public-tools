17 His Spectre divides & Los in fury compells it to  divide: To labour in the fire. in the water. in the earth. in  the air. To follow the Daughters of Albion as the hound follows  the scent Of the wild inhabitant of the forest. to drive them  from his own: To make a way for the Children of Los to come from the  Furnaces But Los himself against Albions Sons his fury bends.  for he Dare not approach the Daughters openly lest he be  consumed In the fires of their beauty & perfection & be  Vegetated beneath Their Looms. in a Generation of death & resurrection  to forgetfulness They wooe Los continually to subdue his strength: he                                          continually                      Shews them his Spectre: sending him abroad over the  four points of heaven In the fierce desires of beauty & in the tortures of  repulse! He is The Spectre of the Living pursuing the Emanations of  the Dead. Shuddring they flee: they hide in the Druid Temples in  cold chastity: Subdued by the Spectre of the Living & terrified by  undisguisd desire. For Los said: Tho my Spectre is divided: as I am a  Living Man I must compell him to obey me wholly! that Enitharmon  may not Be lost: & lest he should devour Enitharmon: Ah  me! Piteous image of my soft desires & loves: O  Enitharmon! I will compell my Spectre to obey: I will restore to  thee thy Children. No one bruises or starves himself to make himself fit  for labour: Tormented with sweet desire for these beauties of  Albion They would never love my power if they did not seek to  destroy Enitharmon: Vala would never have sought & loved  Albion If she had not sought to destroy Jerusalem: such is  that false And Generating Love: a pretence of love to destroy  love: Cruel hipocrisy unlike the lovely delusions of  Beulah: And cruel forms, unlike the merciful forms of Beulahs  Night They know not why they love nor wherefore they sicken  & die Calling that Holy Love: which is Envy Revenge &  CrueltyMan Which separated the stars from the mountains: the  mountains from And left Man. a little grovelling Root, outside of  Himself. Negations are not Contraries: Contraries mutually  Exist: But Negations Exist Not: Exceptions & Objections &  Unbeliefs Exist not: nor shall they ever be Organized for ever &  ever: If thou separate from me, thou art a Negation: a  meer Reasoning & Derogation from me. an Objecting & cruel  Spite And Malice & Envy: but my Emanation. Alas! will  become My Contrary: O thou Negation. I will continually  compell Thee to be invisible to any but whom I please, &  when And where & how I please, and never! never! shalt thou  be Organized But as a distorted & reversed Reflexion in the  Darkness And in the Non Entity: nor shall that which is  above Ever descend into thee: but thou shalt be a Non Entity  for ever And if any enter into thee, thou shalt be an  Unquenchable Fire And he shall be a never dying Worm. mutually tormented  by Those that thou tormentest, a Hell & Despair For ever  & ever. So Los in secret with himself communed & Enitharmon  heard In her darkness & was comforted: yet still she divided  away In gnawing pain from Los's bosom in the deadly  Night; First as a red Globe of blood trembling beneath his  bosom Suspended over her he hung: he infolded her in his  garments Of wool: he hid her from the Spectre, in shame &  confusion of Face; in terrors & pains of Hell & Eternal Death,  the Trembling Globe shot forth Self-living & Los howld  over it: Feeding it with his groans & tears day & night without  ceasing: And the Spectrous Darkness from his back divided in  temptations. And in grinding agonies in threats: stiflings: &  direful strugglings Go thou to Skofield: ask him if he is Bath or if he is  Canterbury Tell him to be no more dubious: demand explicit  words Tell him: I will dash him into shivers, where & at  what time I please: tell Hand & Skofield they are my ministers  of evil To those I hate; for I can hate also as well as  they!
