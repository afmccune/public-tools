Dear Sir
I am so much better                         that I have hopes of
fulfilling my expectation &                         desire of Visiting Hampstead
I am nevertheless very                         considerably weakend by the Last
severe attacks Pray remember me                         with Kind Love to
Mrs                         Linnell & her lovely Family
Yours Sincerely
July 14:1826  William Blake
