38 A Little BOY Lost Nought loves another as itself Nor venerates another so, Nor is it possible to thought A greater than itself to know: And Father, how can I love you, Or any of my brothers more? I love you like the little bird That picks up crumbs around the door. The Priest sat by and heard the child. In trembling zeal he siez'd his hair: He led him by his little coat; And all admir'd the Priestly care. And standing on the altar high. Lo what a fiend is here! said he: One who sets reason up for judge Of our most holy Mystery. The weeping child could not be heard. The weeping parents wept in vain: They strip'd him to his little shirt. And bound him in an iron chain. And burn'd him in a holy place. Where many had been burn'd before: The weeping parents wept in vain. Are such things done on Albions shore.
