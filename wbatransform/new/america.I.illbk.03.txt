Preludium The shadowy daughter of Urthona stood before red Orc, When fourteen suns had faintly journey'd o'er his dark  abode; His food she brought in iron baskets, his drink in cups  of iron; Crown'd with a helmet & dark hair the nameless female  stood; A quiver with its burning stores, a bow like that of  night, When pestilence is shot from heaven; no other arms she  need: Invulnerable tho' naked, save where clouds roll round  her loins, Their awful folds in the dark air; silent she stood as  night; For never from her iron tongue could voice or sound  arise; But dumb till that dread day when Orc assay'd his  fierce embrace. Dark virgin; said the hairy youth. thy father stern  abhorr'd; Rivets my tenfold chains while still on high my spirit  soars; Sometimes an eagle screaming in the sky, sometimes a  lion, Stalking upon the mountains, & sometimes a whale I  lash The raging fathomless abyss, anon a serpent folding Around the pillars of Urthona, and round thy dark  limbs, On the Canadian wilds I fold, feeble my spirit  folds. For chaind beneath I rend these caverns; when thou  bringest food I howl my joy: and my red eyes seek to behold thy  face In vain! these clouds roll to & fro, & hide thee from  my sight.
