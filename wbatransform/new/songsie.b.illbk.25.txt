The sun descending in the west.
The evening star does shine,
The birds are silent in their nest.
And I must seek for mine,
The moon like a flower,
In heavens high bower;
With silent delight,

Where flocks have took delight;
Where lambs have nibbled, silent moves
The feet of angels bright;
Unseen they pour blessing,
And joy without ceasing,
On each bud and blossom,
And each sleeping bosom.
They look in every thoughtless nest.
Where birds are coverd warm;
They visit caves of every beast,
To keep them all from harm:
If they see any weeping.
That should have been sleeping
They pour sleep on their head
And sit down by their bed.
