 Melancholy. Pensieroso
7 Come pensive Nun devout & pure
 Sober stedfast & demure
 All in Robe of darkest grain
 Flowing with majestic train
 Come but keep thy wonted state
 With even step & musing gate
 And looks commercing with the Skies 

 And join with thee calm Peace & Quiet
 Spare Fast who oft with Gods doth diet
 And hears the Muses in a ring
 Ay. round about Joves altar Sing
 And add to these retired Leisure
 Who in trim Gardens takes his pleasure
 But first & chiefest with thee bring
 Him who yon Soars on golden Wing
 Guiding the Fiery wheeled Throne
 The Cherub Contemplation

 Less Philomel will deign a song
 In her sweetest saddest plight
 Smoothing the rugged Brow of Night
 While Cynthia Checks her dragon yoke
 Gently o'er the accustomed Oak
These Personifications are all brought together in
this design surrounding the Principal Figure Who is
 Melancholy herself
