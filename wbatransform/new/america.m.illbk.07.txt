Albions Angel stood beside the Stone 
of night, and saw
The terror like a comet, or more like the
planet red
That once inclos'd the terrible wandering comets in its sphere.
Then Mars thou wast our center, & the planets three flew round
Thy crimson disk; so e'er the Sun was rent from thy red sphere; 
The Spectre glowd his horrid length staining the temple long
With beams of blood; & thus a voice came forth. and shook the 
 temple
