12 Why wilt thou give to her a Body whose life is but a  Shade?  Her joy and love, a shade! a shade of sweet  repose: But animated and vegetated, she is a devouring  worm: What shall we do for thee O lovely mild Jerusalem? And Los said. I behold the finger of God in  terrors! Albion is dead! his Emanation is divided from him! But I am living! yet I feel my Emanation also  dividing Such thing was never known! O pity me, thou all-piteous-one! What shall I do! or how exist. divided from  Enitharmon? Yet why despair! I saw the finger of God go forth Upon my Furnaces, from within the Wheels of Albions  Sons: Fixing their Systems, permanent: by mathematic  power Giving a body to Falshood that it may be cast off for  ever. With Demonstrative Science piercing Apollyon with his  own bow: God is within. & without! he is even in the depths of  Hell: Such were the lamentations of the Labourers in the  Furnaces: And they appeard within & without incircling on both  sides The Starry Wheels of Albions Sons, with Spaces for  Jerusalem: And for Vala the shadow of Jerusalem: the ever  mourning shade: On both sides. within & without beaming  gloriously: Terrified at the sublime Wonder. Los stood before his  Furnaces. And they stood around, terrified with admiration at  Erins Spaces For the Spaces reachd from the starry heighth, to the  starry depth; And they builded Golgonooza: terrible eternal  labour! What are those golden builders doing? where was the  burying-place Of soft Ethinthus? near Tyburns fatal Tree? is  that Mild Zions hills most ancient promontory; near  mournful Ever weeping Paddington? is that Calvary and  Golgotha? Becoming a building of pity and compassion? Lo! The stones are pity, and the bricks, well wrought  affections; Enameld with love & kindness, & the tiles engraven  gold Labour of merciful hands: the beams & rafters are  forgiveness: The mortar & cement of the work. tears of honesty: the  nails, And the screws & iron braces, are well wrought  blandishments, And well contrived words, firm fixing, never  forgotten, Always comforting the remembrance: the floors,  humility, The cielings, devotion: the hearths, thanksgiving: Prepare the furniture O Lambeth in thy pitying  looms! The curtains, woven tears & sighs, wrought into lovely  forms For comfort. there the secret furniture of Jerusalems  chamber Is wrought: Lambeth! the Bride the Lambs Wife loveth  thee; Thou art one with her & knowest not of self in thy  supreme joy Go on, builders in hope: tho Jerusalem wanders far  away. Without the gate of Los: among the dark Satanic  wheels. Fourfold the Sons of Los in their divisions: and  fourfold. The great City of Golgonooza: fourfold toward the  north And toward the south fourfold, & fourfold toward the  east & west Each within other toward the four points: that  toward Eden. and that toward the World of Generation. And that toward Beulah. and that toward Ulro; Ulro is the space of the terrible starry wheels of  Albions sons: But that toward Eden is walled up. till time of  renovation: Yet it is perfect in its building. ornaments &  perfection. And the Four Points are thus beheld in Great  Eternity West, the Circumference: South, the Zenith: North. The Nadir; East, the Center, unapproachable for  ever. These are the four Faces towards the Four Worlds of  Humanity In every Man. Ezekiel saw them by Chebars flood. And the Eyes are the South. and the Nostrils are the  East. And the Tongue is the West, and the Ear is the  North. And the North Gate of Golgonooza toward  Generation: Has four sculpturd Bulls terrible before the Gate of  iron. And iron, the Bulls: and that which looks toward  Ulro. Clay bak'd & enamel'd. eternal glowing as four  furnaces: Turning upon the Wheels of Albions sons with enormous  power. And that toward Beulah four, gold. silver, brass, &                                iron; And
