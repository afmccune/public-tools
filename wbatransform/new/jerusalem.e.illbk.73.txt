Such are Cathedrons golden Halls: in the City of  Golgonooza
And Los's Furnaces howl loud; living; self-moving;  lamenting
With fury & despair. & they stretch from South to  North
Thro all the Four Points: Lo! the Labourers at the  Furnaces
Rintrah & Palamabron, Theotormon & Bromion. loud  labring
With the innumerable multitudes of Golgonooza, round  the Anvils
Of Death, But how they came forth from the Furnaces &  how long
Vast & severe the anguish eer they knew their Father;  were
Long to tell & of the iron rollers, golden axle-trees  & yokes
Of brass. iron chains & braces & the gold. silver &  brass
Mingled or separate: for swords; arrows; cannons;  mortars
The terrible ball: the wedge: the loud sounding hammer  of destruction
The sounding flail to thresh: the winnow: to winnow  kingdoms
The water wheel & mill of many innumerable wheels  resistless
Over the Fourfold Monarchy from Earth to the Mundane  Shell.
Perusing Albions Tomb in the starry characters of Og &  Anak:
To Create the lion & wolf the bear: the tyger &  ounce:
To Create the wooly lamb & downy fowl & scaly  serpent
The summer & winter: day & night: the sun & moon &  stars
The tree: the plant: the flower: the rock: the stone:  the metal;
Of Vegetative Nature; by their hard restricting  condensations.
Where Luvahs World of Opakeness grew to a period:  It
Became a Limit. a Rocky hardness without form &  void
Accumulating without end: here Los who is of the  Elohim
Opens the Furnaces of affliction in the Emanation
Fixing The Sexual into an ever-prolific Generation
Naming the Limit of Opakeness Satan & the Limit of  Contraction
Adam, who is Peleg & Joktan: & Esau & Jacob: & Saul &  David
Voltaire insinuates that these Limits are the cruel  work of God
Mocking the Remover of Limits & the Resurrection of  the Dead
Setting up Kings in wrath: in holiness of Natural  Religion
Which Los with his mighty Hammer demolishes time on  time
In miracles & wonders in the Four-fold Desart of  Albion
Permanently Creating to be in Time Reveald &  Demolishd
Satan Cain Tubal Nimrod Pharoh Priam Bladud Belin
Arthur Alfred the Norman Conqueror Richard John

And all the Kings & Nobles of the Earth & all their  Glories
These are Created by Rahab & Tirzah in Ulro; but  around
These. to preserve them from Eternal Death Los  Creates
Adam Noah Abraham Moses Samuel David Ezekiel

Dissipating the rocky forms of Death. by his  thunderous Hammer
As the Pilgrim passes while the Country permanent  remains
So Men pass on! but States remain permanent for  ever
The Spectres of the Dead howl round the porches of  Los
In the terrible Family feuds of Albions cities &  villages
To devour the Body of Albion, hungring & thirsting &  ravning
The Sons of Los clothe them & feed. & provide houses &  gardens
And every Human Vegetated Form in its inward  recesses
Is a house of pleantness & a garden of delight Built  by the
Sons & Daughters of Los in Bowlahoola & in  Cathedron
From London to York & Edinburgh the Furnaces rage  terrible
Primrose Hill is the mouth of the Furnace & the Iron  Door;
