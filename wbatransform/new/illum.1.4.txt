    Lines cut deeper into the plate will be wider, hold more ink, and print darker than those cut slightly (figs. 12, 13). By varying the depths and widths of lines, the engraver creates lines that taper and swell (fig. 10), and by combining and hatching them in various ways (figs. 6, 7), creates the illusion of tone and mass.
