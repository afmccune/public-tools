Proverbs of Hell
Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with  
bricks of Religion. 
The pride of the peacock is the glory of God. 
The lust of the goat is the bounty of God.  
The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God. 
The nakedness of woman is the work of God. 
Excess of sorrow laughs.  Excess of joy weeps. 
The roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging  
of the stormy sea, and the destructive sword, are  
portions of eternity too great for the eye of man. 
The fox condemns the trap, not himself. 
Joys impregnate, Sorrows bring forth. 
Let man wear the fell of the lion, woman the fleece of  
the sheep. 
The bird a nest. the spider a web, man friendship. 
The selfish smiling fool. & the sullen frowning fool. shall 
be both thought wise. that they may be a rod. 
What is now proved was once, only imagin'd. 
The rat, the mouse. the fox, the rabbet; watch the roots, 
the lion. the tyger, the horse, the elephant, watch  
the fruits, 
The cistern contains; the fountain overflows 
One thought, fills immensity. 
Always be ready to speak your mind, and a base man 
will avoid you. 
Every thing possible to be believ'd is an image of truth. 
The eagle never lost so much time, as when he submit- 
-ted to learn of the crow.
