are often sitting by our cottage                         fire, and often we think we hear your
voice calling at the gate. Surely                         these things are real and eternal in
our eternal mind, and can never                         pass away. My wife continues well,
thanks to Mr. Birch's Electrical                         Magic, which she has discontinued
these three months.
I remain your sincere                         and obliged,
WILLIAM BLAKE.
