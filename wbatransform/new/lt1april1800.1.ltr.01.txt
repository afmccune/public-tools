Dear Sir
With all possible Expedition I send you a proof of my
attempt to Express your & our Much Beloveds Countenance
Mr Flaxman has seen it & approved of my now sending it
to you for your remarks. Your sorrows & your dear sons
May Jesus & his Angels assuage & if it is consistent with
his divine providence restore him to us & to his labours
of Art & Science in this World
So prays a fellow sufferer
1 April 1800  & Your humble servant
Hercules Buildings Lambeth  Willm Blake
