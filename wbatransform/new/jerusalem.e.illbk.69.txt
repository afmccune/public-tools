69 Then all the Males combined into One Male & every  one Became a ravening eating Cancer growing in the  Female A Polypus of Roots of Reasoning Doubt Despair &  Death. Going forth & returning from Albions Rocks to  Canaan: Devouring Jerusalem from every Nation of the  Earth. Envying stood the enormous Form at variance with  Itself In all its Members: in eternal torment of love &  jealousy: Drivn forth by Los time after time from Albions cliffy  shore, Drawing the free loves of Jerusalem into infernal  bondage; That they might be born in contentions of Chastity &  in Deadly Hate between Leah & Rachel. Daughters of Deceit  & Fraud Bearing the Images of various Species of  Contention And Jealousy & Abhorrence & Revenge & deadly  Murder.

In the Circumference: & every Minute Particular is  Holy: Embraces are Cominglings: from the Head even to the  Feet And not a pompous High Priest entering by a Secret  Place.
