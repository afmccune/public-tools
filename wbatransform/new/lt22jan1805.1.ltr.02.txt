edition. And he will go equal shares with me in the expense and
the profits, and that Seagrave is to be the printer. That we must
consider all that has been printed as lost, and begin anew, unless we
can apply some of the plates to the new edition. I consider myself
as only put in trust with this work, and that the copyright is for ever
yours. I, therefore, beg that you will not suffer it to be injured by my
ignorance, or that it should in any way be separated from the grand
bulk of your literary property. Truly proud I am to be in possession
of this beautiful little estate; for that it will be highly productive, I
have no doubt, in the way now proposed; and I shall consider myself
a robber to retain more than you at any time please to grant. In
short, I am tenant at will, and may write over my door as the poor
barber did, "Money for live here."
I entreat your immediate advice what I am to do, for I would not
for the world injure this beautiful work, and cannot answer P.'s pro-
posal till I have your directions and commands concerning it; for he
wishes to set about it immediately, and has desired that I will give
him my proposal concerning it in writing.
I remain, dear Sir,
Your obliged and affectionate,
WILL. BLAKE.
