And I have given thee a crown that none can take away: But how this is sweet maid, I know not, and I cannot know. I ponder, and I cannot ponder; yet I live and love. The daughter of beauty wip'd her pitying tears with her white veil, And said. Alas! I knew not this. and therefore did I weep: That God would love a Worm I knew, and punish the evil foot That wilful, bruis'd its helpless form: but that he cherish'd it With milk and oil. I never knew; and therefore did I weep. And I complaind in the mild air, because I fade away. And lay me down in thy cold bed. and leave my shining lot. Queen of the vales, the matron Clay answerd; I heard thy sighs. And all thy moans flew o'er my roof. but I have call'd them down: Wilt thou O Queen enter my house, 'tis given thee to enter. And to return; fear nothing. enter with thy virgin feet. IV
