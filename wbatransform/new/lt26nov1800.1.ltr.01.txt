DEAR SIR,
Absorbed by the poets Milton, Homer, Camoens, Ercilla,
Ariosto, and Spenser, whose physiognomies have been my delightful
study, Little Tom has been of late unattended to, and my wife's
illness not being quite gone off she has not printed any more since
you went to London. But we can muster a few in colours and some
in black which I hope will be no less favour'd tho' they are rough
 like rough sailors. We mean to begin printing again to-morrow.
Time flies very fast and very merrily. I sometimes try to be miser-
able that I may do more work, but find it is a foolish experiment.
Happinesses have wings and wheels; miseries are leaden legged and
their whole employment is to clip the wings and to take off the
wheels of our chariots. We determine, therefore, to be happy and
do all that we can, tho' not all that we would. Our dear friend
Flaxman is the theme of my emulation in this of industry, as well as
in other virtues and merits. Gladly I hear of his full health and
spirits. Happy son of the Immortal Phidias, his lot is truly glorious,
and mine no less happy in his friendship and in that of his friends.
Our cottage is surrounded by the same guardians you left with us;
they keep off every wind. We hear the west howl at a distance, the
south bounds on high over our thatch, and smiling on our cottage
says, 'You lay too low for my anger to injure.' As to the east and
north I believe they cannot get past the turret.
