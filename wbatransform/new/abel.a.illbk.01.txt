THE GHOST of ABEL
A Revelation In the Visions of Jehovah
Seen by William Blake
To LORD BYRON in the Wilderness
What doest thou here Elijah?
Can a Poet doubt the Visions of Jehovah? Nature has no Outline:
but Imagination has, Nature has no Tune: but Imagination has!
Nature has no Supernatural & dissolves: Imagination is Eternity
Scene. A rocky Country. Eve fainted over the dead body
of Abel which lays near a Grave. Adam kneels by her Jehovah
stands above
Jehovah  혰 Adam!
Adam  -혰 I will not hear thee more thou Spiritual Voice
Is this Death?
Jehovah_ Adam!
Adam  ___ It is in vain: I will not hear thee
Henceforth! Is this thy Promise that the Womans Seed
Should bruise the Serpents head: Is this the Serpent? Ah!
Seven times O Eve thou hast fainted over the Dead Ah! Ah!
Eve revives
Eve Is this the Promise of Jehovah! O it is all a vain delusion
This Death & this Life & this Jehovah!
Jehovah 혰 Woman! lift thine eyes
A Voice is heard coming on
Voice O Earth cover not thou my Blood! cover not thou my Blood
Enter the Ghost of Abel
Eve Thou Visionary Phantasm thou art not the real Abel.
Abel Among the Elohim a Human Victim I wander I am their House
Prince of the Air & our dimensions compass Zenith & Nadir
Vain is thy Covenant O Jehovah I am the Accuser & Avenger
Of Blood O Earth Cover not thou the Blood of Abel
Jehovah What Vengeance dost thou require
Abel  -혰 Life for Life! Life for Life!
Jehovah He who shall take Cains life must also Die O Abel
And who is he? Adam wilt thou. or Eve thou do this
Adam It is all a Vain delusion of the all creative Imagination
Eve come away & let us not believe these vain delusions
Abel is dead & Cain slew him! We shall also Die a Death
And then! what then! be as poor Abel a Thought: or as
This! O what shall I call thee Form Divine: Father of Mercies
That appearest to my Spiritual Vision: Eve seest thou also.
Eve _ I see him plainly with my Minds Eye, I see also Abel living:
Tho terribly afflicted as We also are. yet Jehovah sees him
