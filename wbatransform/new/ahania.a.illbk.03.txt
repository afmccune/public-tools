AHANIA Chap: Ist 1: Fuzon. on a chariot iron-wing'd On spiked flames rose; his hot visage Flam'd furious! sparkles his hair & beard Shot down his wide bosom and shoulders On clouds of smoke rages his chariot And his right hand burns red in its cloud Moulding into a vast globe. his wrath As the thunder-stone is moulded Son of Urizens silent burnings 2: Shall we worship this Demon of smoke. Said Fuzon. this abstract non-entity This cloudy God seated on waters Now seen. now obscur'd; King of sorrow? 3: So he spoke. in a fiery flame, On Urizen frowning indignant, The Globe of wrath shaking on high Roaring with fury. he threw The howling Globe: burning it flew Lengthning into a hungry beam. Swiftly 4: Oppos'd to the exulting flam'd beam The broad Disk of Urizen upheav'd Across the Void many a mile. 5: It was forg'd in mills where the winter Beats incessant: ten winters the disk Unremitting endur'd the cold hammer. -ber'd 6: But the strong arm that sent it. remem- The sounding beam; laughing it tore through That beaten mass: keeping its direction The cold loins of Urizen dividing. 7: Dire shriek'd his invisible Lust Deep groan'd Urizen! stretching his awful hand Ahania (so name his parted soul) He siez'd on his mountains of Jealousy, He groand anguishd & called her Sin, Kissing her and weeping over her: Then hid her in darkness in silence; Jealous tho' she was invisible. 8: She fell down a faint shadow wandring In chaos and circling dark Urizen. As the moon anguishd circles the earth; Hopeless! abhorrd! a death-shadow. Unseen. unbodied. unknown, The mother of Pestilence. 9: But the fiery beam of Fuzon Was a pillar of fire to Egypt Five hundred years wandring on earth Till Los siezd it and beat in a mass With the body of the sun.
