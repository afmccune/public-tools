Dear Cumberland I have been very                         near the Gates of Death & have returned very weak & an                         Old Man feeble & tottering. but not in Spirit & Life not in The Real Man                         The Imagination which Liveth for Ever. In that I am stronger &                         stronger as this Foolish Body decays. I thank you for the Pains you                         have taken with Poor Job. I know too well that a great majority of                         Englishmen are fond of The Indefinite which they Measure by Newton's                         doctrine of the Fluxions of an Atom. A Thing that does not Exist.                         These are Politicians & think that Republican Art is Inimical to their                         Atom. For a Line or Lineament is not formed by Chance a Line is a                         Line in its Minutest Subdivisions Strait or Crooked It is Itself & Not                         Intermeasurable with or by any Thing Else Such is Job but since the French                         Revolution Englishmen are all Intermeasurable One by Another                         Certainly a happy state of Agreement to which I for One do not Agree God                         keep me from the Divinity of Yes & No too The Yea Nay Creeping Jesus from supposing Up & Down to be the                             same Thing as all                         Experimentalists must suppose You are desirous I                         know to dispose of some of my Works & to make them Pleasin I am obliged to you & to all who do so But having none                             remaining of all that I had                         Printed I cannot Print more Except at a great loss for at the time I                         printed those things I had a whole House to range in now I am shut up in a                         Corner therefore am forced to ask a Price for them that I scarce                         expect to get from a Stranger. I am now Printing a Set of the Songs of                         Innocence & Experience for a Friend at Ten Guineas which I cannot do                         under Six Months consistent with my other Work, so that I have little                         hope of doing any more of such things. the Last Work I produced is a                         Poem Entitled Jerusalem the Emanation of the Giant Albion. but find that                         to Print it will Cost my Time the amount of
