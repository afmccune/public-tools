 Joe Bradley saw for he had but one eye  saw a treacle Jar 
 So he goes of his blind side & dips his hand up to the shoulder in
 treacle, here  lick lick lick said he Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha 
 For he had but one eye Ha Ha Ha Ho then sung Scopprell
 And I ask the Gods no more

 Hail Matrimony made of Love
 To thy wide gates how great a drove
 On purpose to be  yok'd do come
    W idows & maids & Youths also
 That lightly trip on beauty's toe
 Or sit on beauty's bum
   
 Hail  fingerfooted lovely Creatures 
 The females of our human Natures
 Formed to suckle all Mankind
   Tis  you that come in time of need
 Without you we  shoud shouldnever Breed
 Or any Comfort find
   
 For if a Damsel's blind or lame
 Or nature's hand has crooked her frame
