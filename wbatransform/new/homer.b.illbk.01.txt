On Homers' Poetry
Every Poem must necessarily be a perfect Unity, but why
 Homers is peculiarly so. I cannot tell: he has told the
 story of Bellerophon & omitted the Judgment of Paris which
 is not only a part, but a principal part of Homers subject
 But when a Work has Unity it is as much in a Part as in the
 Whole. the Torso is as much a Unity as the Laocoon
 As Unity is the cloke of folly so Goodness is the cloke of
 knavery Those who will have Unity exclusively in Homer
 come out with a Moral like a sting in the tail: Aristotle says
 Characters are either Good or Bad: now Goodness or Badness
 has nothing to do with Character. an Apple tree a Pear tree
 a Horse a Lion. are Characters but a Good Apple tree or a
 Bad. is an Apple tree still: a Horse is not more a Lion for
 being a Bad Horse, that is its Character: its Goodness or
 Badness is another consideration.
 It is the same with the Moral of a whole Poem as with the
 Moral Goodness of its parts Unity & Morality. are secondary
 considerations & belong to Philosophy & not to Poetry. to Excep-
-tion & not to Rule. to Accident & not to Substance. the Anci-
 ents calld it eating of the tree of good & evil.

On Virgil
 Sacred Truth has pronounced that Greece & Rome as
 Babylon & Egypt: so far from being parents of Arts & Sci-
 -ences as they pretend: were destroyers of all Art. Homer
 Virgil & Ovid confirm this opinion & make us reverence
 The Word of God, the only light of antiquity that remains
 unperverted by War. Virgil in the Eneid Book VI. line 848
 says Let others study Art;  Rome has somewhat better to
 do. namely War & Dominion
 Rome & Greece swept Art into their maw & destroyd it
 a Warlike State never can produce Art. It will Rob & Plunder
 & accumulate into one place. & Translate & Copy & Buy &
