root of an oak, he was suspended in a fungus
which hung with the head downward into the deep:
By degrees we beheld the infinite Abyss, fiery 
as the smoke of a burning city; beneath us at an 
immense distance was the sun, black but shining 
round it were fiery tracks on which revolv'd vast 
spiders. crawling after their prey; which flew or 
rather swum in the infinite deep, in the most ter- 
-rific shapes of animals sprung from corruption. 
& the air was full of them, & seemd composed 
of them; these are Devils. and are called Powers 
of the air, I now asked my companion which was my 
eternal lot? he said, between the black & white spiders
But now, from between the black & white spiders 
a cloud and fire burst and rolled thro the deep 
blackning all beneath. so that the nether deep grew 
black as a sea & rolled with a terrible noise: be- 
-neath us was nothing now to be seen but a black 
tempest, till looking east between the clouds & the 
waves. we saw a cataract of blood mixed with fire 
and not many stones throw from us appeard and 
sunk again the scaly fold of a monstrous serpent 
at last to the east, distant about three degrees ap- 
-peard a fiery crest above the waves slowly it rear- 
-ed like a ridge of golden rocks till we discoverd 
two globes of crimson fire. from which the sea 
fled away in clouds of smoke, and now we saw, it 
was the head of Leviathan, his forehead was di 
-vided into streaks of green & purple like those on 
a tygers forehead: soon we saw his mouth & red 
gills hang just above the raging foam tinging the 
black deep with beams of blood, advancing toward
us
