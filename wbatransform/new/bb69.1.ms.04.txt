4 Sometimes with secure delight
 The upland Hamlets will invite
 When the merry Bells ring round
 And the jocund Rebecks Sound
 To many a youth & many a Maid
 Dancing in the chequerd Shade
 And Young & Old come forth to play
 On a Sunshine Holiday
In this design is Introduced
 Mountains on whose barren breast 
 The Labring Clouds do often rest
 Mountains Clouds Rivers Trees appear
Humanized on the Sunshine Holiday. The
Church Steeple with its merry bells The
Clouds arise from the bosoms of Mountains
While Two Angels Sound their Trumpets
in the Heavens to announce the Sunshine
Holiday
