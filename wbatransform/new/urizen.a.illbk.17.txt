Urizen. C;V.
8. The globe of life blood trembled
Branching out into roots;
Fib'rous, writhing upon the winds;
Fibres of blood. milk and tears;
In pangs. eternity on eternity,
At length in tears & cries imbodied
A female form trembling and pale
Waves before his deathy face
9, All Eternity shudderd at sight
Of the first female now separate
Pale as a cloud of snow
Waving before the face of Los
10. Wonder, awe, fear, astonishment
Petrify the eternal myriads,
At the first female form now separate
