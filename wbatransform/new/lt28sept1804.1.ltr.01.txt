 Dear Sir
I hope you will                         excuse my delay in sending the Books which I have had
some time but kept them back till                         I could send a Proof of the Shipwreck
which I hope will please. It yet                         wants all its last & finishing touches. but I
hope you will be enabled by it to                         judge of the Pathos of the Picture
I send Washingtons                             2 d Vol:___ 5 Numbers of Fuseli's                         Shakespeare &
two Vol's with a Letter from Mr Spilsbury with whom I accidentally met
in the Strand. he says that he                         relinquishd Painting as a Profession. for
which I think he is to be                         applauded. but I concieve that he may be a much
better Painter if he practices secretly & for amusement than he could ever be 
if employed in the drudgery of                         fashionable dawbing for a poor pittance of
money in return for the sacrifice                         of Art & Genius. he says he never will
leave to Practise the Art because                         he loves it & This Alone will pay its labour 
by Success if not of money yet of                         True Art. which is All _
I had the pleasure of a call from                             Mrs Chetwynd & her Brother. a Giant                         in
body mild & polite in soul as                         I have in general found great bodies to be
they were much pleased with                         Romneys Designs, Mrs C. sent to me the two
articles for you & for the                         safety of which by the Coach I had some fears till
Mr                         Meyer obligingly undertook to convey them safe he is now I suppose                         enjoying
the delights of the Turret of                         Lovely Felpham please to give my affectionate
compliments to him.
I cannot help                         suggesting an Idea which has struck me very forcibly
that the Tobit and Tobias in your                         bedchamber would make a very beautiful Engraving done
in the same manner as the Head of                         Cowper after Lawrence. The Head to be finishd
& the figures left exactly in                         imitation of the first strokes of the Painter The Expression
of those truly Pathetic heads                         would then be transmitted to the Public a singular Monument
of Romneys Genius in that Highest                         branch of Art
I must now tell my                         wants & beg the favor of some more of the needful
