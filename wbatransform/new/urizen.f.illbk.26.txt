I Urizen. C:IX. They lived a period of years Then left a noisom body To the jaws of devouring darkness 5. And their children wept, & built Tombs in the desolate places. And form'd laws of prudence, and call'd them The eternal laws of God 6, And the thirty cities remaind Surrounded by salt floods, now call'd Africa; its name was then Egypt. 7. The remaining sons of Urizen Beheld their brethren shrink together Beneath the Net of Urizen: Perswasion was in vain; For the ears of the inhabitants, Were wither'd, & deafen'd, & cold; And their eyes could not discern, Their brethren of other cities, 8. So Fuzon call'd all together The remaining children of Urizen: And they left the pendulous earth: They called it Egypt. & left it. 9, And the salt ocean rolled englob'd The End of the first book of Urizen.
