Jan.                             22nd, 1805. DEAR SIR, I hope this letter will                         outstrip Mr. Phillips', as I sit down to write immediately on returning                         from his house. He says he is agree- able to every proposal you have                         made, and will himself immediately reply to you. I should have                         supposed him mad if he had not, for such clear and generous proposals                         as yours to him he will not easily meet from any one else. He will,                         of course, inform you what his sentiments are of the proposal                         concerning the three dramas. I found it unnecessary to mention anything                         relating to the purposed applica- tion of the profits, as he, on                         reading your letter, expressed his wish that you should yourself set a price,                         and that he would, in his letter to you, explain his reasons for wishing                         it. The idea of publishing one volume a year he considers as impolitic,                         and that a handsome general edi- tion of your works would be more                         productive. He likewise objects to any periodical mode of publishing                         any of your works, as he thinks it somewhat derogatory as well as                         unprofitable. I must now express my thanks for your generous manner                         of proposing the Ballads to him on my account, and inform you                         of his advice concerning them; and he thinks that they should be                         published all together in a volume the size of the small edition of                         the Triumphs of Temper, with six or seven plates. That one thousand                         copies should be the first edition, and if we choose, we might add to                         the number of plates in a second
