			<updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of Blake's water color illustrations for Robert Blair's 
				<hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>
				. These are probably the 20 designs selected in 1805 by R. H. Cromek for publication in his forthcoming edition of 
				<hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>
				, although only 12 were engraved by Louis Schiavonetti for the volume, published in 1808. One design, 
				<hi rend="i">The Widow Embracing her Husband's Grave</hi>
				, has been known for many years, but the other 19 water colors disappeared between their auction in 1836 and their dramatic rediscovery in 2001. These 19 were sold individually at auction in spring 2006 and are now widely dispersed. The Grave water colors are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program). They join Schiavonetti's engravings and Blake's white-line etching of one design, &quot;Deaths Door,&quot; previously published in the Archive.

				<price>£2100</price>
				<note>Commissioned from Blake by Robert H. Cromek in the fall of 1805 (Cromek probably paid £21 for the group of twenty finished designs).  This water color was probably part of the group acquired by Thomas Sivright of Edinburgh but was separated from its companions at an unknown time (see Work Information for all the water colors).  Perhaps still with the other nineteen water colors when the group was sold from Sivright's collection, C. B. Tait auction, Edinburgh, 10 Feb. 1836, lot 1835, described as a &quot;Volume of Drawings by Blake, Illustrative of Blair's Grave&quot; and &quot;entitled,&quot; apparently on a label no longer extant, &quot;Black Spirits and White, Blue Spirits and Grey&quot; (£1.1s., possibly to John Stannard or a dealer acting for him).  This water color may be the design sold from the stock of the dealer Joseph Hogarth, Southgate and Barrett auction, London, 7 June 1854, lot 237, described as &quot;Children at the Grave of their Parent&quot; (with 5 others, 11s. to H. Palser).  The later history of this water color is as follows: J. F. Hall by 1876; the dealer Carfax &amp; Co., London; Mrs. Louisa Bishop, nee Salaman, by 1912; her son, Euston Bishop, probably by gift or inheritance; sold Sotheby's, 19 May 1958, lot 11 (£280 to the dealer Agnew's acting for Gwen, Lady Melchett); sold from Lady Melchett's collection, Christie's, 9 Nov. 1971, lot 74 (£2100 to the dealer Baskett and Day acting for Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon); given by Mellon in 1975 to the Yale Center for British Art.</note>
