            <hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
            century were relief and intaglio. In the former, the design
          is put into relief by cutting what is not part of the design below the surface,
          and in the latter, designs are incised into metal plates. Woodcut, an example
          of the former, was the first printing technique, in use by the late 14th
          century. Engraving, invented in the 15th century, was the first of the intaglio
          techniques. It requires gravers or burins (figs. 1, 2, C) with
          wedge-shaped tips for gouging lines into the surface of metal plates, scrapers
          (figs. 4, 5) to remove the metal forced up by the burin (the
          burr), and burnishers (figs. 6, 7) to polish lines smooth. A
          whetstone (fig. D) is used to sharpen the burins.

          polishing the plates surface, a compass (fig. 17) for measurements, and
          calipers (fig. 18) to mark the point on the plates verso that needed to
          be hammered up when lines on the surface had been scraped down to erase a

          drawing, writing, painting, and etching, engraving is nonautographic and a
          skill requiring years of training. This is why most painters interested in
          making prints learned etching, a technique in which one uses a needle like a
          pen and thus drawing skills already acquired, rather than engraving.

            century, this practice had been replaced by
          mixed method engraving, a combination of etching and engraving,
          in which the design was first scratched through the ground with a needle and
          bitten into the plate with acid and then finished with burins (see series of
          illustrations demonstrating etching). </lexh>

          <lexh justify="left">Mixed-method engraving had become the economic and
          aesthetic norms, because it greatly shortened the amount of time required to
          produce a print and because the resulting line systems were believed (though
          not by Blake) to be more supple, versatile, and grand than either engraving or
          etching alone and hence superior to the works of the ancient
          engravers. As an apprentice to James Basire, a master engraver, Blake learned
          the arts of etching and engraving and excelled in the commercial styles then
          popular, and though he felt spiritually aligned with the ancient engravers, he
          did not emulate their practice until late in the last decade of his
          life.</lexh>

          as their paradigm, which had evolved into a highly artificial, albeit virtuoso,

        <lg justify="left">
          <lexh justify="left">Despite their remarkable graphic language and skill,
          engravers were considered more copyist and craftsman than artist because they
          were not the inventors of the designs. The muse inspires the artist, pointing
          to his head as the true origin of the design, which moves from concept to work
          on paper or canvas and through the reproductive process, through etching (boy
          agitating the acid) to engraving, a move symbolizing the distance between
          original and copy. The dismissal of craft or execution as less significant than
          invention deeply bothered Blake; philosophically, in a platonic aesthetic, this
          hierarchy and separation extended to the artist as well, since the material
          artifact could not realize perfectly the idea as originally conceived in the
          mind. While Blake stated that he copied imagination as others copied nature, he
          countered this received hierarchy and separation by arguing that invention can
          only be known as it is executed and that execution generates invention.

          the press. The intaglio plate is placed face up on the long plank
          (bed) of the press, dampened paper is placed on top of it, and
          three or four felt blankets cover them as the bed passes through heavy top and

          the incised lines of the plate.
