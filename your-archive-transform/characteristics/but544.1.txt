
A group of three devils—or a multi-headed devil—is pictured below Christ in the lower left corner of the image.  These may be personifications of the "winds" and "grisly spectres" named in the text.  The figures are buried in the earth; only their heads and two arms are visible.  The head of the figure furthest left is buried up to its nose.  To the right, the second figure's left shoulder is raised; her(?) left arm is bent and rests on the ground with her hand resting on the head to the left.  The figure's back appears to be covered in scales.  To the right, the third figure is old and has long hair and a beard.  His left hand rests on top of his head.  All three figures look up and to the right and wear expressions of fear or surprise.  The reticulated body of a worm or serpent's tail extends out of the earth to the left and right; it may be a part of central figure with scales.
A large snake or serpent with a spiky crest on its head rises to the left of Christ.  Mottled coloring along the length of its body suggests scales.  The serpent's body forms a single loop near the left border of the design.  The serpent's head is positioned just to the left of Christ's head.  The serpent faces right with its mouth open and tongue extended.
