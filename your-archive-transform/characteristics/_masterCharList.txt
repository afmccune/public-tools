A group of three devils—or a multi-headed devil—is pictured below Christ in the lower left corner of the image.  These may be personifications of the "winds" and "grisly spectres" named in the text.  The figures are buried in the earth; only their heads and two arms are visible.  The head of the figure furthest left is buried up to its nose.  To the right, the second figure's left shoulder is raised; her(?) left arm is bent and rests on the ground with her hand resting on the head to the left.  The figure's back appears to be covered in scales.  To the right, the third figure is old and has long hair and a beard.  His left hand rests on top of his head.  All three figures look up and to the right and wear expressions of fear or surprise.  The reticulated body of a worm or serpent's tail extends out of the earth to the left and right; it may be a part of central figure with scales.
Ahania

A large snake or serpent with a spiky crest on its head rises to the left of Christ.  Mottled coloring along the length of its body suggests scales.  The serpent's body forms a single loop near the left border of the design.  The serpent's head is positioned just to the left of Christ's head.  The serpent faces right with its mouth open and tongue extended.

Eight figures appear left and right of the maypole in the lower

                     portion of the design. The head, left shoulder and left arm of a figure appear

                     eighth from the left. The figure is featureless and is partially obscured by

                     the personified tree to the right and the child below. The figure's head may

                     rest on its shoulder. Its left arm is raised at 135 degrees with the palm held

                     vertically; it may touch or hold the palm of the figure to the left. The figure's right

                     arm(?) may also be raised above his or her head. The figure may be

                  dancing.

Eleven distinct figures stand on the stairs in the central right portion of the design; other indistinct shapes likely represent additional figures. A gowned male with long hair and a beard stands ninth from the left. He faces forward with his head turned slightly right and his mouth open. The figure's left foot is raised on tiptoe and he may descend the staircase. Both arms are bent upward and the palms of his hands are held vertically.

Three figures lie submerged at the bottom of the lake; they are upside down with their heads oriented down, towards the viewer. They may have drowned. A nude(?) male with long hair and a beard appears furthest left. He faces up with his head turned to the left. Both legs are bent and drawn up with the knees prominent. The figure's left arm is bent and rests on the ground beside his head; his left hand is closed in a fist.
