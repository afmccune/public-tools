     Songs of Innocencecopy E, 1789, as it left Blake’s printshop: the impressions were stabbed through three holes between sheets of wove paper (“wrappers”).

Blake knew that purchasers would have the books rebound to fit the style of the other books in their libraries. Berg Collection, New York Public Library.
