       The ancient Poets animated all sensible objects
  with Gods or Geniuses, calling them by the names and 
  adorning them with the properties of woods. rivers, 
  mountains. lakes, cities, nations, and whatever their 
 enlarged & numerous senses could percieve.
   And particularly they studied the genius of each
 city & country. placing it under its mental deity.
   Till a system was formed, which some took ad-
 vantage of & enslav'd the vulgar by attempting to
 realize or abstract the mental deities from their
 objects; thus began Priesthood.
   Choosing forms of worship from poetic tales.
   And at length they pronouncd that the Gods
 had orderd such things.
   Thus men forgot that All deities reside
 in the human breast.
