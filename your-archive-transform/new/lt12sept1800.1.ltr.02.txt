My Dearest Friend
It is to you I owe All my present Happiness
It is to you I owe perhaps the Principal Happiness of
my life. I have presumed on your friendship in
staying so long away & not calling to know of your
welfare but hope, now every thing is nearly completed
for our removal to Felpham that I shall see you
on Sunday as we have appointed Sunday afternoon to
ll on Mrs Flaxman at Hampstead. I send you
a few lines which I hope you will Excuse. And
As the time is now arrivd when Men shall again
converse in Heaven & walk with Angels I know
you will be pleased with the Intention & hope
you will forgive the Poetry
To
