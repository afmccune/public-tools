 1  Now the Serpent was more  subtil    than any beast of the field that the Lord God had  
      mad  . and he said unto the Woman Yea hath God said Ye shall not eat of  
    every tree of the garden   
 2    And the woman said unto the Serpent We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
  3     garden    
 3    But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said Ye   
    shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die   
 4  And the serpent said unto the woman Ye shall not surely die    
 5  For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof your eyes shall be opened &       
    and ye shall be as Gods (Elohim) knowing good & evil    
 6¶⁋ And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant    
    to the eyes & a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof   
    and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did eat    
 7  And the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and    
    they sewed Fig leaves  togethe   and made themselves aprons    
 8  And they heard the Voice of the Lord God walking in the garden. in the cool of the day  
    and adam & his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst 
    the trees of the garden   
 9   And the Lord  Cod   called unto Ad  am   and said unto him Where art thou    
 10 And he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was   
    naked and I hid myself    
 1   1   And he said Who told thee that thou wast naked hast thou eaten of the tree–   
    whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat   
 12 And   Adam  said the woman whom thou gavest me to be with me she gave me of the    
    tree and I did eat   
 13 And the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou hast done and the 
  14     woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat    
  14 And the Lord God said unto the  srepent   Because thou hast done this thou art    
    accursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon they belly    
   shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life
