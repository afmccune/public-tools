    Engravings, like all intaglio plates, are printed on rolling presses. A printer operates a rolling press, another inks a plate on a brassier, and another wipes a plates surfaces of ink in preparation for the press. The intaglio plate is placed face up on the long plank (bed) of the press, dampened paper is placed on top of it, and three or four felt blankets cover them as the bed passes through heavy top and bottom rollers. The top roller exerts great pressure to force the paper into the incised lines of the plate. Encyclop√©die , 1767. Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
