Dear Sir
done
. I have I believe^ nearly all that we agreed
on &c If you should put on your considering Cap just as
you did last time we met I have no doubt that the Plates
would be all the better for it _ I cannot get Well
& am now in Bed but seem as if I should be better
tomorrow rest does me good â€” Pray take care of
your health this wet weather & Tho I write do not
venture out on such days as today has been. I hope
a few more days will bring us to a conclusion
I am dear Sir
Thursday Evening  Yours Sincerely
