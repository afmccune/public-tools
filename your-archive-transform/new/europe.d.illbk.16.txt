    Ethinthus queen of waters, how thou shinest in the sky:
 My daughter how do I rejoice! for thy children flock around
 Like the gay fishes on the wave, when the cold moon drinks the dew.
 Ethinthus! thou art sweet as comforts to my fainting soul:
 For now thy waters warble round the feet of Enitharmon.

 Sweet smiling pestilence! I see thy blushing light:

 Down the steps of my crystal house.
    Sotha & Thiralatha: secret dwellers of dreamful caves.
 Arise and please the horrent fiend with your melodious songs.
 Still all your thunders golden hoofd, & bind your horses black
 Orc! smile upon my children!
 Smile son of my afflictions,
 Arise O Orc and give our mountains joy of thy red light.
    She ceas'd, for All were forth at sport beneath the solemn moon 
 Waking the stars of Urizen with their immortal songs.
 That nature felt thro' all her pores the enormous revelry.
 Till morning ope'd the eastern gate. 
 Then every one fled to his station. & Enitharmon wept.
    But terrible Orc, when he beheld the morning in the east,
