16
Hell is naked before him & Destruction has no covering
Canst thou by searching find out God
Canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection
 The Accuser of our Brethren is Cast down
which accused them before our God day & night
It is higher than Heaven what canst thou do
 It is deeper than Hell what canst thou know
 The Prince of this World shall be cast out
Thou hast fulfilled the Judgment of the Wicked
Even the Devils are Subject to Us thro thy Name. Jesus said unto them. I saw Satan as lightning fall from Heaven
God hath chosen the foolish things of the World to confound the wise 
 And God hath chosen the weak things of the World to confound the things that are mighty
