Dear Sir
I have at length seen Mr Hoare after having
repeatedly calld on him every day & not finding him. I now
understand that he recievd your reply to P.'s Proposal
at Brighton where he has a residence. from whence he
sent it to London to Mr Phillips. he has not seen
P. since his return & therefore cannot tell me how
he understood your Answer. Mr H. appears to
me to consider it as a rejection of the Proposal altogether
I took the liberty to tell him that I could not consider
it so. but that as I understood you, You had accepted
the Spirit of P's intention which was to leave the
whole conduct of the affair to you & that you had
accordingly nominated one of your Friends & agreed
to nominate others. but if P. meant that you should
yourself take on you the drudgery of the ordinary
business of a Review his Proposal was by no means
a generous one. Mr H. has promised to see Mr Phillips
immediately & to know what his intentions are. but he
says. Perhaps Mr P. may not yet have seen your letter
