having recievd a Letter from you on the same Day I
recievd mine & said somewhat, I cannot tell which, that
made me think you had opend your Proposal to him _
I thought at any rate it would not be premature to
tell him what you had said about the Designs for Edward
the first. & he advised it to be done as above related
I will soon speak with Phillips about it if you will
favor me with a line of direction how to proceed,_Hope
in a few days to send Proofs of Plates which I must
say are far beyond Any thing I have ever done. For
O happiness never enough to be grateful for! I have
lost my Confusion of Thought while at work & am as
much myself when I take the Pencil or Graver into
my hand as I used to be in my Youth I have indeed
fought thro a Hell of terrors & horrors (which none could
know but myself.) in a Divided Existence now no longer
Divided. nor at war with myself I shall travel on in
the strength of the Lord God as Poor Pilgrim says
My wife joins me in Love to You & to our Dear
Friend & Friends at Lavant & in all Sussex
I remain Dear Sir Your Sincere & obliged
