    The first engravers practiced pure engraving: an outline of the design was transferred from paper onto a thin wax ground covering the plates surface and the lines were cut directly into the metal with burins. By the 18 th century, this practice had been replaced by mixed method engraving, a combination of etching and engraving, in which the design was first scratched through the ground with a needle and bitten into the plate with acid and then finished with burins (see series of illustrations demonstrating etching).
