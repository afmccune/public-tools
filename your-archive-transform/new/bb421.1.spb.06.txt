And there came a Messenger unto Job & said The Oxen were plowing & the Sabeans came down. & they have slain the Young Men with the Sword
Going to & fro in the Earth & walking up & down in it

 there came also another & said  
 The fire of God is fallen from heaven & hath burned up the flocks & the
Young Men & consumed them. & only I am escaped alone to tell thee
