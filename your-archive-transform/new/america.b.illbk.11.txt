      Sound! sound! my loud war-trumpets & alarm my Thirteen Angels!
 Loud howls the eternal Wolf! the eternal Lion lashes his tail!
 America is darkned; and my punishing Demons terrified
 Crouch howling before their caverns deep like skins dry'd in the wind,
 They cannot smite the wheat, nor quench the fatness of the earth,
 They cannot smite with sorrows, nor subdue the plow and spade,
 They cannot wall the city, nor moat round the castle of princes.
 They cannot bring the stubbed oak to overgrow the hills.
 For terrible men stand on the shores, & in their robes I see
 Children take shelter from the lightnings, there stands Washington
 And Paine and Warren with their foreheads reard toward the east
 But clouds obscure my aged sight. A vision from afar!
 Sound! sound! my loud war-trumpets & alarm my thirteen Angels:
 Ah vision from afar! Ah rebel form that rent the ancient
 Heavens! Eternal Viper self-renew'd, rolling in clouds 
 I see thee in thick clouds and darkness on America's shore.
 Writhing in pangs of abhorred birth; red flames the crest rebellious
 And eyes of death; the harlot womb oft opened in vain
 Heaves in enormous circles, now the times are return'd upon thee,
 Devourer of thy parent, now thy unutterable torment renews. 
 Sound! sound! my loud war trumpets & alarm my thirteen Angels,
 Ah terrible birth! a young one bursting! where is the weeping mouth?
 And where the mother's milk? instead those ever-hissing jaws
 And parched lips drop with fresh gore; now roll thou in the clouds
 Thy mother lays her length outstretch'd upon the shore beneath.
 Sound! sound! my loud war-trumpets & alarm my thirteen Angels!
 Loud howls the eternal Wolf: the eternal Lion lashes his tail!
