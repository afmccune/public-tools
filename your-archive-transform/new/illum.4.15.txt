    Design of text and illustration drawn directly on the plate without the aid of transfers. The lettering style, letter size, spacing between word and line, number of lines, the texts shape, the vignettes placement are all determined when the text is rewritten on the plate, which means that the parts that form the page design are visually composed when executed. Because the page design as such does not pre-exist its execution, relief etching produces rather than reproduces its designs.
