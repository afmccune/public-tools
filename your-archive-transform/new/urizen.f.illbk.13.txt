1 Urizen CV,
Two Nostrils bent down to the deep
And a fifth Age passed over;
And a state of dismal woe.
11. In ghastly torment sick;
Within his ribs bloated round.
A craving Hungry Cavern
Thence arose his channeld Throat.
And like a red flame a Tongue
Of thirst & of hunger appeard
And a sixth Age passed over.
And a state of dismal woe.
12. Enraged & stifled with torment
He threw his right Arm to the north
His left Arm to the south
Shooting out in anguish deep,
And his Feet stampd the nether Abyss
In trembling & howling & dismay,
And a seventh Age passed over;
And a state of dismal woe.
Chap: V.
1. In terrors Los shrunk from his
task;
His great hammer fell from his hand.
His fires beheld, and sickening.
Hid their strong limbs in smoke.
For with noises ruinous loud;
With hurtlings & clashings & groans
The Immortal endur'd his chains,
Tho' bound in a deadly sleep.
2, All the myriads of Eternity:
All the wisdom & joy of life:
Roll like a sea around him.
Except what his little orbs
Of sight by degrees unfold.
3, And now his eternal life
Like a dream was obliterated
4, Shudd'ring. the Eternal Prophet smote
With a stroke, from his north to south
region
The bellows & hammer are silent now
A nerveless silence, his prophetic voice
Siez'd; a cold solitude & dark void
The Eternal Prophet & Urizen clos'd
5. Ages on ages rolld over them
Cut off from life & light frozen
Into horrible forms of deformity
Los suffer'd his fires to decay
Then he look'd back with anxious desire
But the space undivided by existence
Struck horror into his soul.
6. Los wept obscur'd with mourning;
His bosom earthquak'd with sighs,
He saw Urizen deadly black,
In his chains bound, & Pity began.
7 In anguish dividing & dividing
For pity divides the soul
In pangs eternity on eternity
Life in cataracts pourd down his
cliffs
The void shrunk the lymph into Nerves
Wand'ring wide on the bosom of night
And left a round globe of blood
Trembling upon the Void
