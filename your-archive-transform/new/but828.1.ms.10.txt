 Ch â€“ V How generation & death took Possession of the Natural Man 
 & of the forgiveness of Sins written upon the Murderers  forhead    
  1 And Adam knew Eve his wife and she  conceovd   & bare Cain and said I h    av     
    I have gotten a man from Jehovah    
  2 And she again bore his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the    
    sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground         
  3 And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of  
       the ground for an Offering to the Lord       
  4 And Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat there   
    of. and the Lord had respect unto Abel and his Offering But to Cain     
    5 But to Cain and to his offering he had not res  pect   and Cain was very wroth  
    and his countenance fell   
  6 And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth & why is thy countenance fallen 
    7 If thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin    
    lieth at the door and to thee shall be his desire & thou shalt rule over him  
    8 And Cain talked with his brother and it came to pass when they were in the  
    field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother & slew him    
  9 And the Lord said unto Cain Where is Abel thy brother and he said I know    
    not am I my brothers keeper   
  10 And he said What hast thou done the voice of thy brothers blood crieth   
    unto me from the ground (Adamah)    
  11 And now thou art cursed from the groun  d   (adamah) which hath opened    
    her mouth to receive thy brothers blood from thy hand   
  12 When thou tillest the ground (adamah) it shall not henceforth yield unto thee  
    her strength a fugitive & a vagabond thou shal  t    be in the earth    
  13 And Cain said unto the Lord My punishment is greater than I can bear   
    14 Behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth & from 
    thy face shall I be hid and a fugitive & a vagabond in the earth and it    
    shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me
