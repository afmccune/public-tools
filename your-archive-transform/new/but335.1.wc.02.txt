2 Gray writing his Poems
3 The Purple Year awaking from the Roots of
Nature. & The Hours suckling their.
Flowery Infants
4 "With me the Muse shall sit & think
At ease reclin'd in rustic state"

F Brushd by the hand of
Or chilld by Age"
Rough mischance or Chilld by Age
6 Summer Flies reproaching the Poet
Summer flies reproachg th Poet
