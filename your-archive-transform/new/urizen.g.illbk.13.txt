I Urizen. C:IV
7. From the caverns of his jointed Spine,
Down sunk with fright a red
Round globe hot burning deep
Deep down into the Abyss;
Panting: Conglobing, Trembling
Shooting out ten thousand branches
Around his solid bones.
And a second Age passed over,
And a state of dismal woe.
8. In harrowing fear rolling round;
His nervous brain shot branches
Round the branches of his heart
On high into two little orbs
And fixed in two little caves
Hiding carefully from the wind.
His Eyes beheld the deep.
And a third Age passed over;
And a state of dismal woe,
9. The pangs of hope began.
In heavy pain striving, struggling.
Two Ears in close volutions.
From beneath his orbs of vision
Shot spiring out. and petrified
As they grew, And a fourth Age pass
And a state of dismal woe.
10. In ghastly torment sick;
Hanging upon the wind;
