1 Urizen C: III.
As the stars are apart from the earth
9. Los wept howling around the dark
Demon:
And cursing his lot for in anguish.
Urizen was rent from his side:
And a fathomless void for his feet;
And intense fires for his dwelling.
10. But Urizen laid in a stony sleep
Unorganiz'd, rent from Eternity
11. The Eternals sai  What is this? Death
Urizen is a clod of clay.
