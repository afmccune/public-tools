PRELUDIUM
The nameless shadowy female rose from out the breast of Orc:
Her snaky hair brandis in the winds of Enitharmon:
And thus her voice arose.
O mother Enitharmon wilt thou bring forth other sons?
To cause my name to vanish, that my place may not be found,
For I am faint with travel!
Like the dark cloud disburdend in the day of dismal thunder.
My roots are brandish'd in the heavens, my fruits in earth beneath
Surge, foam, and labour into life, first born & first consum'd!
Consumed and consuming!
Then why shouldst thou accursed mother bring me into life?
I wrap my turban of thick clouds around my lab'ring head:
And fold the sheety waters as a mantle round my limbs,
Yet the red sun and moon,
And all the overflowing stars rain down prolific pains.
