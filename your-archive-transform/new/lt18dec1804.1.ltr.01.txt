DEAR SIR,
I send with some confidence, proofs of my two plates, having
had the assistance and approbation of our good friend Flaxman. He
approves much (I cannot help telling you so much) of the *Shipwreck.*
Mrs. Flaxman also, who is a good conoisseur in engraving, has given
her warm approbation, and to the plate of the *Portrait*, though not yet
in so high finished a state. I am sure (mark my confidence) with Flax-
man's advice, which he gives with all the warmth of friendship both to
you and me, it must be soon a highly finished and properly finished
print; but yet I must solicit for a supply of money, and hope you will be
convinced that the labour I have used on the two plates has left me
without any resource but that of applying to you. I am again in want
of ten pounds; hope that the size and neatness of my plate of the
*Shipwreck* will plead for me the excuse for troubling you before it can
be properly called finished, though Flaxman has already pronounced
it so. I beg your remarks also on both my performances, as in their
present state they will be capable of very much improvement from a
few lucky or well advised touches. I cannot omit observing that the
price Mr. Johnson gives for the plates of Fuseli's *Shakespeare* (the
concluding numbers of which I now send) is twenty-five guineas
each. On comparing them with mine of the *Shipwreck*, you will
perceive that I have done my duty and put forth my whole strength.
Your beautiful and elegant daughter *Venusea* grows in our estima-
tion on a second and third perusal. I have not yet received the
History of Chichester. I mention this not because I would hasten
its arrival before it is convenient, but fancy it may have miscarried.
My wife joins me in wishing you a merry Christmas. Remembering
our happy Christmas at lovely Felpham, our spirits seem still to hover
round our sweet cottage and round the beautiful Turret. I have said
*seem*, but am persuaded that distance is nothing but a phantasy. We
