     The House of Death, color-print drawing, 1795, from a series of twelve. These color prints, approximately 40 x 60 cm., brilliantly combine printmaking and painting. Most of the plates were printed twice, with the second impression a little lighter than the first because it was taken from the plate without it being recolored. Most of the plates were reprinted c. 1805. Fitzwilliam Museum.
