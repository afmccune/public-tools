    Blake used his rolling press to print relief-etchings, adjusting it so it printed with less pressure. Whereas commercial printers of intaglio plates could use three people in the printing processone handling the press and paper, one for inking the plate, another for wiping ink from the surface of the plateBlake needed only two, since he did not have to wipe the surface of his plates clean of ink. He and his wife probably worked as a team, with Mrs. Blake handling the paper and press and Blake inking the plates and placing them on the bed of the press.
