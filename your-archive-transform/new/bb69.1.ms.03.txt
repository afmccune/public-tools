3 Sometime walking not unseen
 By hedge row Ellms on Hillocks green
 Right against the Eastern Gate
 Where the Great Sun begins his state
 Robed in Flames & amber Light
 The Clouds in thousand Liveries dight
 While the Plowman near at hand
 Whistles o'er the Furrowd Land
 And the Milkmaid singeth blithe
 And the Mower whets his Scythe
 And every Shepherd tells his Tale
 Under the Hawthorne in the Dale
 The Great Sun is represented clothed in
 Flames Surrounded by the Clouds in their
 Liveries, in their various Offices at the
 Eastern Gate. beneath in Small Figures
 Milton walking by Elms on Hillocks green 
 The Plowman. The Milkmaid The Mower
 whetting his Scythe. & the Shepherd & his
 Lass under a Hawthorne in the dale
