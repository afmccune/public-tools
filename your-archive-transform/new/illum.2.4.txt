    The first intaglio tonal method was mezzotint, developed in the late 17th century to reproduce the tonal gradations of oil paint. Mezzotinters work from black to white, rather than on a white ground with black line. The plate is roughened with a rocker, a tool with serrated edges (fig. 1) that incised the entire plate with thousands of overlapping lines to create, when printed, a solid black ground. Working with scrapers and burnishers, the mezzotinter reduces the ground and thus the amount of ink printed to create grays and whites (fig. 9). Encyclop√©die , 1767.
