 Deuter my . ch:34 th :v.6 th : & Jude v.9 th :
   And the Lord buried Moses in a valley, in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor; but no
 man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.
 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the Devil he disputed about the body
 of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, the Lord rebuke thee.
