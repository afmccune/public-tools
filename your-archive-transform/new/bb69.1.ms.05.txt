5 Then to the Spicy Nut brown Ale
 With Stories told of many a Treat
 How Fairy Mab the junkets eat
 She was pinchd & pulld she said
 And he by Friars Lantern led
 Tells how the drudging Goblin sweat
 To earn his Cream Bowl duly Set
 When in one Night e'er glimpse of Morn
 His shadowy Flail had threshd the Corn
 That ten day labourers could not end
 Then crop-full out of door he flings
 E'er the first Cock his Matin rings

 The Goblin crop full flings out of doors
 from his Laborious task dropping his Flail
 & Cream bowl yawning & stretching vanishes
 into the Sky. in which is Seen Queen Mab
 Eating the Junkets. The Sports of the Fairies
 are seen thro the Cottage where "She" lays
 in Bed "pinchd & pulld" by Fairies as they dance
on the Bed the Cieling & the Floor & a Ghost
pulls the Bed Clothes at her Feet. "He" is seen
following the Friars Lantern towards the Convent
