    Despite their remarkable graphic language and skill, engravers were considered more copyist and craftsman than artist because they were not the inventors of the designs. The muse inspires the artist, pointing to his head as the true origin of the design, which moves from concept to work on paper or canvas and through the reproductive process, through etching (boy agitating the acid) to engraving, a move symbolizing the distance between original and copy. The dismissal of craft or execution as less significant than invention deeply bothered Blake; philosophically, in a platonic aesthetic, this hierarchy and separation extended to the artist as well, since the material artifact could not realize perfectly the idea as originally conceived in the mind. While Blake stated that he copied imagination as others copied nature, he countered this received hierarchy and separation by arguing that invention can only be known as it is executed and that execution generates invention.
