Dear Brother Felpham Jany 30 _ 1803
Your Letter mentioning Mr Butts's account of my Ague
surprized me because I have no Ague but have had a Cold
this Winter. You know that it is my way to make the best of
every thing. I never make myself nor my friends uneasy if
I can help it_ My Wife has had Agues & Rheumatisms
almost ever since she has been here but our timeis almost

Sickness to you & should not to Mr Butts but for a determination
which we have lately made namely To leave This Place

As a poet he is frightened at me & as a Painter his

all the devils in hell will never do. I must own that
seeing H. like S Envious (& that he is I am now certain)
made me very uneasy. but it is over & I now defy the
worst & fear not while I am true to myself which I will
be. This is the uneasiness I spoke of to Mr Butts but
I did not tell him so plain & wish you to keep it a
secret & to burn this letter because it speaks so plain
I told Mr Butts that I did not wish to Explore too much
the cause of our determination to leave Felpham because
of pecuniary connexions between H & me_ Be not
then uneasy on any account & tell my Sister not to be
uneasy for I am fully Employd & Well Paid I have
made it so much H's interest to employ me that he can
no longer treat me with indifference & now it is in my
power to stay or return or remove to any other place that I
choose because I am getting before hand in money matters
The Profits arising from Publications are immense &
