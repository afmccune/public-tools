 And this he always kept in mind
 And  formd a crooked knife
 And ran about with bloody hands
 To seek his  mothers life
 5
 And as he ran to seek his mother
 He met with a dead woman
 He fell in love & married her
 A deed which is not common
 6
 She soon grew pregnant & brought forth
 Scurvy & spotted fever
 The father  grind &  skipt about
 And said I'm made for ever

 For now I have  procurd these imps
   Ill  try experiments
 With that he tied poor scurvy down
 &  stopt up all its vents

 And when the child began to swell
 He  shoutd out aloud
   Ive  found the dropsy out & soon
 Shall do the world more good

 He took up fever by the neck
 And cut out all its spots
 And  thro the holes which he had made
 He first discoverd guts
