Dear Sir
You can have no Idea unless you was in
London as I am how much your Name is lovd &
respected _ I have the Extreme pleasure of transmitting
to you one proof of this Respect which you will be
pleased with & I hope will adopt & embrace.
It comes thro' Mr Hoare. from Mr Phillips of
St Pauls Church Yard. it is as yet an intire
secret between Mr P, Mr H; & myself & will remain so
till you have given Your Decision __ Mr Phillips
is a man of vast spirit & enterprize. with a solidity
of character which few have; he is the man who applied
to Cowper for that sonnet in favor of a Prisoner at 
Leicester which I believe you thought fit not to Print
So you see he is spiritually adjoind with us. His
