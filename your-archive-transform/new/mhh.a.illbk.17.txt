      to reconcile them seeks to destroy existence.
   Religion is an endeavour to reconcile the two.
   Note. Jesus Christ did not wish to unite
  but to seperate them, as in the Parable of sheep and 
 goats! & he says I came not to send Peace but a
 Sword.
   Messiah or Satan or Tempter was formerly
 thought to be one of the Antediluvians who are our
 Energies.
   A Memorable Fancy
   An Angel came to me and said O pitiable foolish
  young man! O horrible! O dreadful state! consider 
  the hot burning dungeon thou art preparing for thyself 
  to all eternity, to which thou art going in such career. 
   I said. perhaps you will be willing to shew me
  my eternal lot & we will contemplate together upon it 
 and see whether your lot or mine is most desirable
   So he took me thro' a stable & thro' a church
 & down into the church vault at the end of which
 was a mill; thro' the mill we went. and came to a
 cave. down the winding cavern we groped our tedi-
 -ous way till a void boundless as a nether sky ap-
 -peard beneath us. & we held by the roots of trees
 and hung over this immensity. but I said, if you
 please we will commit ourselves to this void, and
  see whether providence is here also, if you will not 
 I will? but he answerd, do not presume O young-
 man but as we here remain behold thy lot which
 will soon appear when the darkness passes away
   So I remaind with him sitting in the twisted
    root
