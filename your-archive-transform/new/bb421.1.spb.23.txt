21
Great & Marvellous are thy Works
 Lord God Almighty
Just & True are thy Ways
 O thou King of Saints
So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job
more than the beginning
After this Job lived
an hundred & forty years
& saw his Sons & his
 Sons Sons
even four Generations
 So Job died
 being old 
& full of days 
 In burnt Offerings for Sin
thou hast had no Pleasure
