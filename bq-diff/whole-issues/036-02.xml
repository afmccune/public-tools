        <p>G.E. Bentley, Jr. writes about Blake’s life and his books; his <hi rend="i">The Stranger from Paradise: A Biography of William Blake</hi> was
                    published by Yale in 2001, and the second edition of his <hi rend="i">Blake
                        Records</hi> (1969), incorporating <hi rend="i">Blake Records
                        Supplement</hi> (1988) and much added matter, is scheduled for publication
                    by Yale in 2002.</p>
        <p>Martin Butlin was formerly Keeper of the Historic British Collection at the Tate
                    Gallery, London. Since retirement, he has continued to work on Blake, J.M.W.
                    Turner, and other British artists.</p>
        <p>Robert N. Essick teaches English Literature at the University of California,
                    Riverside. He is not nearly as good a printmaker as Joe Viscomi.</p>
        <p>Alexander Gourlay recently edited <hi rend="i">Prophetic Character: Essays on
                        William Blake in Honor of John E. Grant</hi> (Locust Hill Press, 2002), a
                    collection of new work on Blake, much of it by regular contributors to <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly.</hi> He teaches at the Rhode Island
                    School of Design.</p>
        <p>Michael Phillips teaches an interdisciplinary one-year MA course at the Centre
                    for Eighteenth Century Studies, University of York, on William Blake and the Age
                    of Revolution. In addition to publication of <hi rend="i">The Creation of
                        the</hi> Songs, and being guest curator of the recent William Blake
                    exhibition at Tate Britain, he is completing a biography of Blake in Lambeth
                    during the anti-Jacobin terror in Britain. The biography will be anticipated by
                    the Waynflete Lectures he is to deliver as Visiting Fellow at Magdalen College,
                    Oxford, in Spring 2003.</p>
        <p>Joseph Viscomi is James G. Kenan Distinguished Professor of English Literature at
                    the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Unlike Robert Essick, he does
                    not live ten minutes from <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>

          </head>
          <byline>By <docAuthor>Michael <name>Phillips</name></docAuthor></byline>
          <p>I wish to correct a mistake in <hi rend="i">William Blake The Creation of
                            the</hi> Songs <hi rend="i">From Manuscript to Illuminated Printing</hi>
                        (London: The British Library; Princeton: Princeton UP, 2000), specifically
                        in Chapter V, “Colour-Printing <hi rend="i">Songs of
                        Experience.</hi>” This concerns the claim that Blake used a form of
                        pinhole registration in color printing four impressions from Copy T<hi rend="s">1</hi> of <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> in the
                        collection of the National Gallery of Canada.</p>
          <p>In my effort to see every copy of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> in researching
                        my book, I visited the National Gallery of Canada in August 1991. While
                        inspecting the examples in the collection my attention was drawn to the four
                        color-printed impressions of the title-page, “Introduction,”
                        “EARTH’S Answer” and “LONDON.” With the
                        help of the Senior Conservator of Prints and Drawings, Geoffrey Morrow,
                        these were taken to the conservation laboratory and viewed under
                        magnification, raking light and ultraviolet light. This clearly revealed
                        that Blake had used a method involving two printing stages, the first to
                        print in monochrome and the second in colors. In some instances, like that
                        of the title-page, Blake had then applied color with a brush over areas of
                        the color-printed pigments. It was clear that the monochrome ink had been
                        largely absorbed into the fabric of the paper, while the viscous color
                        pigments had been printed with less pressure and remained on the surface,
                        often forming minute peaks and shallows when the print had been lifted from
                        the copper plate.</p>
          <p>From the evidence of our study in the laboratory, we were both curious as to
                        how Blake could have printed these impressions in two stages. In May 1992,
                        Geoffrey sent 35mm. color slides of each of the four color-printed
                        impressions from Copy T<hi rend="s">1</hi>, including a number of details.
                        In his covering letter he suggested that perhaps the “small black dot
                        which can be clearly seen in the very corner of the plate is related to a
                        method of registering the plate.” I wrote asking how he thought this
                        could have been done. He replied that Blake may have used a
                        “swivel” technique, “where the single registration
                        point in the top left corner allowed him to somehow swivel the paper
                        sideways for the addition of colour to the plate and then back into
                        registration for a second printing.” Adding, “It is just a
                        thought, I have never seen such a technique used.” From this
                        speculation I deduced that Blake must have used a pin or etching needle to
                        hold the monochrome impression and registration sheet in place while he
                        swiveled the impression out of the way, either to add color to the plate or
                        to remove it to do so. I tried this method in the printmaking studio. By
                        marking off the opposite corner of the impression (from where it was held by
                        the pin) on the registration sheet, the impression could be swiveled and
                        returned into register. As represented in the 35mm. color slide details, the
                        tiny dot visible in the upper left corner of each impression I interpreted
                        to be the indentation or hole that had been left by the pin or needle using
                        this method.</p>
          <p>In September 2000, while correcting proof of my book, I wrote to ask Geoffrey
                        to check my text where it referred to the color-printed impressions from
                        Copy T<hi rend="s">1</hi> in the collection of the National Gallery of
                        Canada, including the passages referring to pinhole registration (on pp. 98,
                        99 and 101 as published). He replied to say that “Everything looks
                        good except for one sentence” that concerned my description of the
                        blackened lead white pigment that was found on the title-page; a description
                        that I duly amended and passed to the printer.</p>
          <p>Geoffrey Morrow has now confirmed that I was mistaken in deducing from his
                        description that the small black dots seen in the 35mm. color slides were in
                        fact pinholes. I am now able to draw attention to this error in my book.
                        Unfortunately, it was not possible to correct the label in the Tate Britain
                        Blake exhibition describing the title-page of Copy T<hi rend="s">1</hi> of
                            <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> as showing pinhole registration.
                        There was no allowance in the exhibition budget for me to revisit the
                        collections from which I had requested exhibits, where I would have had a
                        chance to look again at the title-page. It was also not possible to see the
                        exhibits in London in time to make changes. All of the exhibits arrived
                        during the week before the opening, and immediately they arrived were
                        unpacked and secured in their showcases under the supervision of their
                        couriers.</p>
          <p>Geoffrey Morrow’s reply to my request to check my descriptions in
                        proof gave me no reason to question the presence of pinhole registration on
                        these four impressions. Nevertheless, as I made clear (p. 101): “The
                        four impressions in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada,
                        title-page, ‘Introduction’ ‘EARTH’S
                        Answer’ and ‘LONDON,’ are the only examples that I have
                        found that have been registered by using a pin. All of the remaining
                        colour-printed impressions have no visible sign of registration.”</p>
          <p>It was the overwhelming evidence that Blake had found another, simpler method
                        of registration that led to the experiments that I describe in my book.
                        After printing the impression in monochrome, Blake could have nipped the
                        margin of the registration sheet and impression between the rollers. This
                        allowed the impression to be lifted at the opposite end to daub the plate
                        with color pigment, or to remove the plate to do so (described on pp.
                        101-02). This method is illustrated in my chapter using the
                        eighteenth-century rolling <pb id="p36-45" n="45"/> press in the Science
                        Museum, London (Fig. 34), the same rolling press that was on display in the
                        Tate Britain Blake exhibition and illustrated in the exhibition catalogue
                        (p. 101).</p>
          <p>A more flexible method of registration was also described. Using this method
                        the monochrome impression and registration sheet passed between the rollers,
                        but before the impression was lifted from the plate a weight was placed at
                        one end. This allowed the opposite end of the impression to be lifted and
                        the copper plate to be daubed with color, or for the plate to be removed,
                        cleaned and applied with color before being placed back into register. As I
                        describe, using this second method also made it possible to remove the print
                        and replace it with a second monochrome impression, which could then be
                        color printed using the color pigments remaining on the plate (pp.
                        107-08).</p>
          <p>Relying upon photographic reproduction led to the error published in my book.
                        Such a mistake illustrates how there is no substitute, however
                        sophisticated, for seeing Blake’s illuminated books and prints
                        firsthand, ideally in laboratory conditions where special lighting and
                        magnification are available. Only by studying Blake’s illuminated
                        books and prints in this way are we able to discover the materials that he
                        used and how they were printed. This in turn will bring us closer to an
                        understanding of the time and effort that were involved in their making, and
                        place us in a position to address questions of intention and audience that
                        follow directly from such an understanding.</p>
          <p>I have recently confirmed my description of events with Geoffrey Morrow. He
                        adds: “The main point, that Blake did use a double printing technique
                        on occasion, is one about which we are in full agreement. Only by examining
                        prints like the title-page under the conditions you describe can the
                        technical reality be experienced with full understanding.”</p>

                            Illustrated Quarterly</hi> 35 (winter 2002): 74-103. This piece, in its
                        concentration on technical detail and its assertion that Blake’s
                        color-printing in his illuminated books was only feasible through an
                        exclusively single-pull technique, seems to me to miss out more general
                        considerations of Blake’s overall development in the 1790s and to
                        leave several important questions unanswered.<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref><note id="n1">

                            d’histoire.</hi> The opening paragraphs
                        (“Introduction” in the web site version) assert that the
                        “first, prominent appearance” of the two-pull technique was in
                        the catalogue of the Tate Britain Blake exhibition of 2000-01, followed by
                        Michael Phillips’ <hi rend="i">William Blake: The Creation of

                        Printing</hi>, published by the British Library in 2000. It was only in 2000
                        that “printing techniques rose to the forefront of attention among
                        the small band of scholars interested in how Blake made his books . .
                        .” (74). This assertion is almost immediately contradicted by
                        footnote 2 (significantly revised in the printed version, 74), which shows
                        that the question of Blake’s color-printing techniques has been
                        discussed from at least as early as Graham Robertson’s account in the
                        1907 edition of Alexander Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">The Life of
                            William Blake</hi> (404-06). This supports the double-pull theory, but
                        the authors discount this by distinguishing Blake’s technique in the
                        large color prints of “1795,” discussed by Robertson, from the
                        color-printing technique in the books, despite the fact that the former grew
                        directly out of the latter. In fact, the double-pull theory was generally
                        accepted, if only as an assumption rather than on the basis of any deep
                        research, until relatively recently. The footnote also refers to the fact
                        that the one-pull method was described by Essick in <hi rend="i">William
                            Blake Printmaker</hi>, but fails to point out that the description is
                        somewhat qualified: “Blake’s technique unites the design or
                        ‘key’ plate and additional color plates into one relief plate,
                        and requires one, or at most two, printing operations” (125). It was
                        in fact Viscomi, in his epochmaking <hi rend="i">Blake and the Idea of the
                            Book</hi> (119-28, 287-88, etc.), who first wholeheartedly promulgated
                        the idea of the one-pull technique at the expense of any other method; this
                        is again relegated to the footnote. The authors fail to point out that, in
                        this respect, Viscomi’s theory was challenged in an otherwise highly
                        positive review of the book in <hi rend="i">The Burlington Magazine</hi> 137
                        (Feb. 1995): 123. Alas, <hi rend="i">The Burlington Magazine</hi>, the
                        leading art-historical journal in Great Britain, clearly does not make a
                        prominent appearance in American literary circles, despite the fact that the
                        review was listed in G.E. Bentley, Jr.’s listings for that year.<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref><pb id="p36-46" n="46"/> It may seem petty to niggle about a mere footnote
                        but, sadly, its approach is symptomatic of the Inquiry as a whole. Surely,
                        the article was, specifically, a review of Phillips’ views on
                        color-printing in his book and at the Tate Gallery. <note id="n2">2.

          <p>And now, to go back nearly three hundred years for another piece of history,
                        Blake’s prospectus “To The Public” of 10 October 1793
                        (E 692-93). The authors of the Inquiry go to some pains to define
                        Blake’s term “Illuminated Printing,” later qualified by
                        Blake as to be “Printed in Colours,” as being “created
                        simply by printing from relief-etched plates” (75). This excludes the
                        books of 1795 printed in intaglio. It seems far more likely however that
                        Blake is relating his books to the “illuminated manuscripts”
                        of the Middle Ages in which text and design are combined on the same page;
                        the use of the word “illuminate” in this sense goes back to
                        the beginning of the eighteenth century. Incidentally, the authors’
                        restricted definition of the books in “Illuminated Printing”
                        has now become their accepted usage, as in their essay in the recent
                        festschrift for Morton Paley;<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> so quickly
                        does a theory become an assertion of fact. <note id="n3">3. Morris Eaves,

                            Palgrave, 2002) 220.</note></p>
          <p>Lacking the detailed expertise and technical experience of the authors of the
                        Inquiry, I must leave most technical details to the better qualified, though
                        one or two points deserve comment, such as the question of the
                        mis-registration of the “Nurses Song” in Copy E of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience.</hi> The Inquiry seems
                        effectively to demonstrate (96-98) that what caused the mis-registration in
                        this case was not color-printing but a reprinting of the outlines of the
                        text in a yellow ink rather than the more painterly pigments of
                        Blake’s color-printing technique; the yellow ink must have been fluid
                        enough to have produced a linear, rather than a more general blotting
                        effect, and indeed the authors refer to the fact that “Yellow ink on
                        top of green color means that the inked text was printed <hi rend="i">after</hi> the color printing in green” (97). In other words, it
                        is not color-printing at all in the usual sense, and Blake soon realized
                        that it was much easier to reinforce such linear elements with the pen or
                        the point of the brush (96). Incidentally, while disposing of the suggestion
                        that the mis-registration of “Nurses Song” proves a two-pull
                        process, the Inquiry fails to take up Phillips’ point (103) that
                        “small failures of registration in colour-printing can also be seen
                        in” other plates in Copy E of the <hi rend="i">Songs.</hi> In fact
                        the authors repeatedly assert that the “Nurses Song” is the
                        sole example of mis-registration (81, 94, 96, 98, 100). Interestingly, these
                        cases seem to have been confined to the odd pages that Blake salvaged for
                        his special copy of the book that he prepared for Thomas Butts in about
                        1805.</p>
          <p>Blake’s main use of color-printing in his books was to produce a depth
                        of color and a textural effect that was impossible in his previous procedure
                        of coloring by hand in watercolors, and it was used for the illustrations
                        and decorative features rather than for the text itself. Linear quality was
                        the one thing for which this technique was not suited. In the first book
                        that Blake seems to have designed from the beginning to be color-printed,
                            <hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen</hi>, 1794, he was careful to
                        distinguish the pictorial areas, whether they filled a whole page or part of
                        a page, from those occupied by the text. In already existing books, such as
                            <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, he did add color-printing to the
                        decorative details that appear among the body of the text. Here the blobs of
                        color-printed pigment can be seen to be more or less superimposed upon the
                        linear decoration but they do not follow the lines with any exactitude. Nor
                        do the fields occupied by the independent designs follow the areas defined
                        by the passages of text with any precision, tending to spread beyond the
                        borders implied by the width of the text. The same happens in <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> of 1795 where, presumably to match the preceding
                        “Continental” books, the format is larger and retains
                        decorative features among the text. (Here, to complicate matters still
                        further, Dörrbecker has suggested that the full-page illustrations
                        were “coloured-printed from almost unetched plates, occasionally in
                        multiple layers of paint . . .” (<hi rend="i">Continental
                            Prophecies</hi> 319); this implies multiple pulls.) Exact registration
                        is therefore hardly a consideration when discussing Blake’s usual
                        form of color-printing and, despite the assertions in the Inquiry, it is
                        very difficult to see that any of the color-printing in Blake’s
                        books, as defined in this sense, avoids the muzziness that the authors claim
                        would result from a two-pull process.</p>
          <p>The Inquiry’s description of how Blake might have used a two-pull
                        process (taken but elaborated from Phillips 95) seems to be deliberately
                        designed to put this process in its worst light by making it as complex as
                        possible (80). The authors seem to have forgotten one of Viscomi’s
                        most important discoveries, that Blake, in his illuminated books of 1789 and
                        the early 1790s, tended to print individual pages in series with one inking
                        of the plate, sometimes continued with a renewed printing possibly in a
                        differently colored ink, before assembling the pages into different copies
                        of the book and coloring them by hand (<hi rend="i">Idea</hi> 112-18,
                        260-61). The Inquiry admits that such series printing could occur in the
                        color-printed books, as in the argument over the “Nurses Song”
                        (96), and also that the color-printing medium could be applied more than
                        once (84n15, 87), but insists on assuming that Blake would have had to wipe
                        the plate completely clean of ink before adding colors, and then wipe the
                        color off the plate before adding ink for the second impression (80). If in
                        fact Blake first continued with his existing practice of printing the
                        outlines on a number of sheets in series, and then went back and printed the
                        same series of sheets with his thick color medium (renewing the color as
                        necessary), the problem of registration would not have been nearly so
                        difficult, particularly in view of the fact that, as we <pb id="p36-47" n="47"/> have already seen, precise registration is not in question.
                        Indeed, Viscomi (<hi rend="i">Idea</hi> 126-28) accepts that “Color
                        printing did not prohibit edition printing,” adding that
                        “Unlike ink, water-soluble colors, even those mixed with a retardant,
                        would have dried on the plate had Blake dawdled.”</p>
          <p>Another assumption made by the authors of the Inquiry is that, in a two-pull
                        process, the color-printing would have to be done whilst the ink was still
                        wet (87). If individual sheets were printed in series, first in ink and then
                        by color-printing, there would have been no necessity for this. However, the
                        authors never examine directly the question of the different drying times of
                        ink and Blake’s color medium, though the implication is that ink took
                        considerably longer to dry, both on the plate and on the paper.</p>
          <p>There is also the problem of what actually happens to the ink in a one-pull
                        process. In my simplistic way I see the processes, whether one-pull or
                        two-pull, as producing a sort of sandwich. In a one-pull process one has the
                        plate at the bottom, then the ink defining the text and the outlines of the
                        designs (the authors suggest that there are exceptions to this when only
                        part of the raised surface of the relief etching is inked) and finally the
                        color-printed medium (again applied selectively); one then adds the paper on
                        top. Removing the paper from the plate reverses the sandwich and one has the
                        final colored page. In a one-pull process one would then expect to find the
                        ink lines lying on top of the denser colored areas. In the case of a
                        two-pull process, the inked text and outlines would be applied to the paper
                        first and subsequently covered, at least in part, by the thick color medium.
                        To the naked eye it would appear that, in so far as one can see the printed
                        outlines, they lie below the color-printed pigment. The authors of the
                        Inquiry use enlargements and enhancements to refute (86-88) Phillips’
                        theory (102-03) that the printed date 1794 in Copy T<hi rend="s">1</hi> was
                        covered by color-printing, saying that this was in fact done by hand. This
                        is, of course, extremely difficult to prove absolutely, and the
                        Inquiry’s approach does not altogether arouse confidence.<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> The caption to illus. 16 (85) reads

          <p>The recently sold independent plate 3 from <hi rend="i">The First Book of
                            Urizen</hi> (Christie’s London, 18 December 2001, lot 84, illus.
                        in color) seems to show, as well as the lines added after the coloring by
                        pen or the point of a brush, printed lines beneath the color. To add to the
                        complications Richard Lloyd, head of the prints department at
                        Christie’s London, has argued to me, unprompted, that in one place a
                        layer of water-color has been added over the printing in ink but under the
                        color-printed pigments. Despite the miracles of modern technology, one feels
                        that such distinctions will always be a question of opinion rather than
                        provable fact.</p>
          <p>Another general point not fully discussed by the authors is that of the
                        relative pressures needed to print on the one hand the outlines in ink and
                        on the other the designs in Blake’s color medium. We are told that
                        printing in color from the depths of a relief etching requires greater
                        pressure than from the surface of a plate (83; Viscomi, <hi rend="i">Idea</hi> 123, 126) but not how this compares with the pressure needed
                        for printing in ink. It is assumed that color-printing from a relief-etched
                        plate and printing in ink are compatible. However, what does seem to be
                        clear is that printing in intaglio requires a much greater degree of
                        pressure (Viscomi 103, 367). That the color-printing was done
                        planographically from the surface of a more or less smooth plate rather than
                        from a relief-etched plate would still create a two-pull process, nor can
                        one see how, for instance, the design at the foot of page 6 of <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi>, let alone that filling the bottom right-hand
                        corner of page 5 of <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi>, could somehow have
                        been applied at the same time as the areas of text above were being printed
                        under much greater pressure. Here surely a two-pull process was necessary,
                        as is admitted by Essick (<hi rend="i">Printmaker</hi> 130): <q> The
                            pressure needed to print the intaglio texts in these books was too much
                            for simultaneous color printing from the plate surfaces. That Blake used
                            a separate printing for the designs is confirmed by the title-page of
                                <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> .... Even in a reproduction, the
                            deep platemark caused by intaglio printing is visible. On both the left
                            and right margins, the design extends about 2 mm. beyond the platemark,
                            indicating that the design could not have been printed from the text
                            plate. The design must have been painted directly on the print and
                            blotted, printed from another plate with a very light pressure, or
                            printed from a sheet of paper .... </q> Again, whatever the precise
                        technique, the process was a multiple one.<ref target="n5" type="note">5</ref><note id="n5">5. The title page of <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi>
                            seems to show Blake experimenting in a different form of color-printing
                            to create textural effects on the otherwise blank paper as well as more
                            typical areas of color around the figure; see David Worrall, <hi rend="i">William Blake, The Urizenic Books</hi> (London: William

                            180, and 181. The effect is very different from, say, the facing
                            frontispiece, Indeed, as Essick says of the two Beinecke Library proofs,
                            “these proofs may record Blake’s progress from single to
                            double printing for his intaglio color printed books . . .”

                            12)—that is, if Blake was actually moving from a single-pull
                            process.</note></p>
          <pb id="p36-48" n="48"/>
          <p>Moreover, if, as we are assured by the authors of the Inquiry, the one-pull
                        process was “more efficient, direct, immediate, and artistically
                        exciting . . .” (100-01), why should Blake move from this supposedly
                        much easier and more exciting process by switching to intaglio printing? It
                        is much easier to believe that this switch was intended to make it easier to
                        print by the two-pull process. The whole development of the books of 1794
                        and 1795 supports this.<ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref> Firstly, there
                        is the simplification found in <hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen</hi>
                        whereby the color-printed designs are confined to particular areas. This was
                        accompanied by the increase in the number of full-page illustrations which,
                        in the case of <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi>, may not have required any
                        etching or printing of the outlines as such at all. Finally, in the last two
                        books of the 1790s, <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> and <hi rend="i">The
                            Book of Ahania</hi>, Blake realized that it was easier to use a two-pull
                        process if he distinguished between linear elements and pictorial elements,
                        and also that it was simpler to print planographically from a basically
                        smooth surface rather than from the pitted surface of a relief-etched plate,
                        hence intaglio printing. Given that, in these two books of 1795, Blake seems
                        to have been obliged to use a two-pull process, and given the way that this
                        seems to have arisen as part of the development shown in the previous books,
                        one can no longer assert that Blake must have confined himself exclusively
                        to a one-pull process. <note id="n6">6. I have been discussing, rather
                            superficially it must be admitted, the development in Blake’s
                            books leading up to the great color prints of “1795” ever
                            since I began a series of reviews of the original Blake Trust’s
                            facsimiles with <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> (<hi rend="i">Burlington Magazine</hi> 101 (July/Aug. 1959): 301-02; see also
                            ibid. 102 (1960): 544-46, and 103 (1961): 368); these reviews are
                            omitted from Bentley’s <hi rend="i">Blake
                        Records.</hi></note></p>
          <p>One must also remember that, until he started using color-printing, Blake
                        employed a double process, printing the text and design outlines from the
                        relief-etched plate and then coloring the plate by hand in watercolor.
                        Conceptually this is as much a “two-pull” process as if he did
                        it in two different sorts of printing. Moreover, the two-pull process does
                        not necessitate “a man who favored precision over variation”
                        (101). It was indeed anything but a mechanical process creating precise
                        registration; rather, it was the reverse of the precision that, it is
                        claimed, could have been produced by a one-pull process. Blake recognized
                        this, in his more detailed designs, by being forced to fill in the outlines
                        in ink or with the point of a brush. Just the same happened in the large
                        color prints of “1795” which the Inquiry leaves out of the
                        discussion. Surely, whatever the precise dates of these large prints and the
                        separate Books of Designs of 1796, they represent a culmination of
                        Blake’s color-printing experiments in which, recognizing the power of
                        his designs on their own, he was able to discard any written text. These
                        prints in their turn led to the small paintings in tempera of 1799-1800,
                        just as the later pulls of the larger color prints, those on paper
                        watermarked 1804<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> (and still neglected
                        for their implications for the dating of the color-printed books), led to
                        the tempera paintings that formed the basis of Blake’s one-man
                        exhibition of 1809. <note id="n7">7. Martin Butlin, “A Newly

          <p>There are also further related topics to be explored. At the end of this
                        crucial period in Blake’s development there is the question of the
                        independent color prints, where Blake seems to have dispensed totally with a
                        printed outline, leading to such experiments as the repeated printing of his
                        color medium under increasing pressure as the medium thinned out from copy
                        to copy. Bentley has led the way with his fascinating article on the
                        full-page plate 21 of <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> from Copy B of
                            <hi rend="i">The Large Book of Designs</hi> in the National Gallery of
                        Victoria, Melbourne.<ref target="n8" type="note">8</ref> This appears to be
                        a repeat pull without any further coloring of the page in Copy A of the same
                        book, and Blake, to obtain a more effective transfer of color, considerably
                        increased the pressure of his printing, resulting in a heavily embossed
                        platemark and the registration of Blake’s relief-etched lines on the
                        reverse of the paper. <note id="n8">8. G.E. Bentley, Jr., “The Shadow

                            color, verso in black and white.</note></p>
          <p>In addition, at the beginning of this period, 1793, there is the (to me)
                        strange case of <hi rend="i">America</hi>, of which only four of the known
                        eighteen copies (of which three are posthumous) have been colored, and that
                        in watercolor rather than by color-printing. Stephen Behrendt has stressed
                        the “monochromaticism” of the uncolored copies and the way in
                        which this underscores their “radical departures from the visual form
                        of the conventional typeset book adorned with engraved
                            illustrations,”<ref target="n9" type="note">9</ref> and Viscomi
                        has pointed out how the lack of color makes “<hi rend="i">America</hi> the most printlike of the early illuminated books”
                            (<hi rend="i">Idea</hi> 264). Dörrbecker goes further in claiming
                        that the particularly elaborate etching technique, including white-line
                        modelling, of <hi rend="i">America</hi> demonstrates that, at least in
                        “the first edition of the ‘Prophecy’, Blake must not
                        have intended to add watercolour washes to these prints” (<hi rend="i">Continental Prophecies</hi> 77). All this suggests that Blake
                        was experimenting in two radically opposed directions in the crucial years
                        1793-94, on the one hand towards the richer effects produced by
                        color-printing and on <pb id="p36-49" n="49"/> the other towards an
                        engraving technique by which he could dispense with color altogether. <note id="n9">9. Stephen C. Behrendt, <hi rend="i">Reading William Blake</hi>
                            (London: Macmillan, 1992) xiii.</note></p>
          <p>Such questions necessitate a much wider approach to this short but radical
                        period of technical experimentation than one confined to the establishment
                        of whether Blake used an exclusive one-pull process or a two-pull process. I
                        do not claim to have answered all the points raised by the Inquiry, let
                        alone to have proved that Blake used an exclusively two-pull process. What
                        is necessary, however, is that those with the skill and technical expertise
                        to research this question should distance themselves a little from the
                        technical details and approach the subject impartially in the light of
                        Blake’s development as a whole. Research along these directions
                        cannot but be more enlightening for our appreciation of Blake’s
                        achievement.</p>

          <p>We are pleased that a scholar of Martin Butlin’s eminence would find
                        our long, technical essay on Blake’s color printing of interest. We
                        are also pleased that, in his reply, he does not take exception to any of
                        our basic arguments in favor of one-pull color printing or question their
                        evidentiary basis. Rather, he raises several issues related, if somewhat
                        peripherally, to our topic, continues to favor a two-pull process, and
                        proposes a new method for two-pull printing distinctly different from the
                        methods offered by Michael Phillips in his recent book, <hi rend="i">William
                            Blake: The Creation of the</hi> Songs <hi rend="i">from Manuscript to
                            Illuminated Printing.</hi> We wish to comment on Butlin’s
                        observations seriatim as they arise in his essay.</p>
          <p>Butlin notes that “the concentration” of our article “on
                        technical detail” missed out the “more general considerations
                        of Blake’s overall development in the 1790s” and left
                        “several important questions unanswered.” Our essay indeed
                        concentrated on a single issue raised by Phillips’ book,
                        Blake’s color printing of relief-etched plates. This topic, however,
                        covers more than 600 impressions in ten books and touches on one of the
                        major goals in Blake studies, that of understanding Blake’s practice
                        and thinking as an artist. More general considerations of all the techniques
                        Blake deployed in his illuminated books, and the evolution of those books
                        into the large color prints of 1795 and finally into the tempera paintings
                        of the late 1790s, would take a book-length study. We (and we suspect the
                        editors of this journal and most of our readers) found our article long
                        enough as it is. The fact that most of the large color prints are
                        planographic (i.e., printed from the surface), and that the temperas were
                        painted (not printed) on their supports, does not alter the way Blake color
                        printed his relief etchings. We continue to believe that questions about
                        print technology are best answered by looking closely at the primary
                        evidence (in this instance, color-printed impressions of Blake’s
                        relief etchings), by conducting experiments in the print studio, and by
                        contextualizing one’s findings within the history of color printing
                        in the eighteenth century. Connoisseurship that produces only the most
                        general comments (“looks like two pulls to me and my
                        friends”), or rounding up the opinions of various scholars and taking
                        a vote, are not as helpful. Technological issues are best resolved by
                        considering “technical detail,” even if this tends to bore or
                        annoy some of our readers. But since Butlin has raised questions about the
                        color-printed intaglio plates and color-print drawings that followed the
                        color-printed relief etchings, we feel compelled to answer them, which we do
                        later in this response.</p>
          <p>Butlin’s second paragraph forces us to quibble over the meaning of
                        “prominent.” As we pointed out in our second footnote, several
                        scholars, including Butlin, had indicated a belief in a two-pull process
                        prior to Phillips’ book. These earlier comments are brief and not
                        even “prominent” within the essays and books in which they
                        appear. It seemed to us discourteous to critique those who had only
                        mentioned the two-pull process in passing and had not offered any supporting
                        arguments or evidence. The history of the two-pull theory prior to
                        Viscomi’s 1993 study, <hi rend="i">Blake and the Idea of the
                            Book</hi>, appears to be one of those cultural traditions that many
                        assent to but none investigates. Surely Phillips must be credited with the
                        first, prominent attempt to make a case for the two-pull theory.<ref target="n11" type="note">2</ref><note id="n11">2. Butlin refers throughout his response to an online version
                            and a “significantly revised” print version of our essay.
                            He is confusing the final online version with an early draft of the
                            essay (15 October 2001) that the authors put online for the purpose of
                            eliciting responses from curators, scholars, print historians, and other
                            invited guests. The published online version (February 2002) and the
                            print version are the same essay, except that the latter has fewer and
                            only black and white illustrations and some of the captions and
                            descriptions of the illustrations are altered to take that into
                            account.</note></p>
          <pb id="p36-50" n="50"/>
          <p>We apologize to Martin Butlin for not including his review of
                        Viscomi’s book in our footnote 2. It was an oversight on our part,
                        not an egregious attempt to slight Butlin’s great contributions to
                        Blake scholarship. As far as we can discover, that review contains
                        Butlin’s fullest statement, prior to his present essay, in support of
                        the two-pull theory—a paragraph of 206 words. There he refers to the
                        “badly registered” impression of “Nurses Song”
                        in the <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> section of <hi rend="i">Songs of
                            Innocence and of Experience</hi> copy E and claims that “having
                        made such an error, Blake could easily have succeeded in the not very
                        difficult task of producing a perfect register.” As we have made
                        clear in our article, producing a “perfect” register, one that
                        shows absolutely no signs of the first pull even under magnification, is,
                        impression after impression, an extraordinarily difficult task indeed, even
                        for the eighteenth-century French masters of multiple-plate (and hence
                        multiple-pull) printing and for twentieth-century masters of color printing,
                        such as Stanley Hayter, who says without qualification that it is not
                        possible (see below). Butlin’s reasoning seems to be that an example
                        of poor registration argues for Blake’s easy mastery of perfect
                        registration. The logic here escapes us.</p>
          <p>Butlin also notes in his paragraph that Viscomi’s “argument,
                        based on the white lines left where the paper failed to pick up the color at
                        the base of the sharply etched relief lines [see cover illus.], could apply
                        irrespective of whether there were one or two printings.” This is
                        true but misses the point concerning registration. These fine white lines
                        parallel their relief lines. When they are produced in a second pull,
                        experiments reveal, they will intersect minutely with their relief lines. It
                        is impossible, impression after impression, to so perfectly register the
                        paper to the copperplate that these very narrow white lines remain perfectly
                        parallel. Minute intersecting or touching of white lines and relief inked
                        lines signifies a second pull, but it is a sign consistently absent from
                        Blake’s color prints.</p>
          <p>According to Butlin, our failure to cite his review, or more generally our
                        “approach” in footnote 2, “is symptomatic of the
                        Inquiry as a whole.” He has a point, in that our concern was with an
                        investigation of the primary evidence rather than with recording every word
                        ever published on Blake’s color printing method. Perhaps if we had
                        concentrated more on that publication record rather than on Blake’s
                        own prints we would have remembered and added Butlin’s review to his
                        other works we cite. We trust that we have now made up for our original
                        oversight. However, given the nature of our approach to the subject, our
                        failure to cite his review is irrelevant to our case for one-pull color
                        printing.</p>
          <p>Butlin expresses discomfort over our “restricted definition” of
                        “Illuminated Printing.” We were concerned with establishing
                        what Blake meant by “Illuminated Printing” in his 1793
                        Prospectus and not trying to determine how the term should always be used.
                        We are not arguing against the use of the term to include later works with
                        unetched plates printed planographically (<hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi>,
                        1795), or those printed from plates etched in intaglio (<hi rend="i">The
                            Book of Los, The Book of Ahania</hi>, both 1795), although Blake did not
                        apply the term to <hi rend="i">The Gates of Paradise</hi> (an intaglio work
                        of 1793) in the Prospectus (E 693). In our contribution to the festschrift
                        for Morton Paley, which we co-authored with Morris Eaves, we claim only that
                        Blake “christened his works in the medium [of relief etching]
                        ‘Illuminated Books’ in ‘Illuminated
                        Printing’” (220) in the 1793 Prospectus. This does not exclude
                        the possibility of Blake so christening works in other media in some other
                        document, nor does it exclude modern scholars from using the term any way
                        they wish, nor does it restrict the historical and theological resonances of
                        the word “illuminated.” We fail to see how we have perpetuated
                        a “restricted definition.” We can’t understand how the
                        simple statement that Blake called his relief-etched works
                        “Illuminated Books” in the 1793 Prospectus shows how
                        “quickly . . . a theory becomes an assertion of fact”
                        (Butlin).</p>
          <p>We find it odd that Butlin believes that “Nurses Song” in the
                            <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> section of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence
                            and of Experience</hi> copy E “is not color-printing at all in
                        the usual sense.” Phillips believes that this impression is
                        color-printed, and so do we. Otherwise, it would not be the center of so
                        much attention. The disagreement we have with Phillips is whether the colors
                        were applied with the ink in one pull (Essick and Viscomi) or separately in
                        a second pull (Phillips). Apparently Butlin agrees with us about which pull
                        produced the color printing—the first one—but misses our
                        point. He quotes our saying that “Yellow ink on top of green color
                        means that the inked text was printed <hi rend="i">after</hi> the color
                        printing in green” (97), and from this he concludes that “in
                        other words, it is not color printing at all in the usual sense.” He
                        appears to have ignored the rest of the passage: <q> . . . <hi rend="i">after</hi> the color printing in green—the reverse of the
                            sequence Phillips proposes for all two-pull color printing. On even
                            closer examination, one can see why Blake printed the text after he had
                            printed the colors. He was actually <hi rend="i">reprinting</hi> the
                            text. He had printed the plate <hi rend="i">à la
                                poupée</hi> with ink and colors together, in the style of the
                            other color-printed plates. . . .The colors printed well but the text
                            was exceptionally faint and illegible. . . . Blake attempted to re-ink
                            the text and print or stamp it into place . . . . (97-98) </q> The
                        registration, however, was poor; the newly printed plate was displaced below
                        its first, exceedingly weak, printing. The ink traces of the text’s
                        first printing are clearly visible in illus. 34a and 34b of the print
                        version and 68-70 of the online version of our “Inquiry.” In
                        other words, the plate was initially printed with ink and colors
                        simultaneously, like all the others; had it been printed well, there would
                        not have been a <hi rend="i">reprinting</hi> of text after colors. But
                        perhaps this is not color printing in the “usual sense”
                        because for Butlin the only “usual” method of color printing
                        requires that the colors be applied in a second pull.</p>

                        comment in which the advocates of the two-pull theory specialize. Which
                        plates? Where in each plate? What is the evidence supporting this opinion?
                        Where is the “overwhelming evidence” (mentioned in his
                        “Correction,” printed in this issue) that Phillips states
                        exists but does not describe? We looked through <hi rend="i">Songs of
                            Innocence and of Experience</hi> copy E (and other color-printed books
                        and prints) with considerable care and could find no further examples of
                        misregistration or signs of a second printing. We believe we failed in this
                        search because Blake printed all plates, except for “Nurses
                        Song” in <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>, in one pull. We dealt at some
                        length in our article with various types of foul inking, found in monochrome
                        impressions as well as color-printed ones, that can be mistaken as evidence
                        of misregistration.</p>
          <p>Dörrbecker’s claim that some of the full-page designs in <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> were “coloured-printed from almost
                        unetched plates, occasionally in multiple layers of paint” (319) does
                        not, as Butlin states, necessarily imply “multiple pulls.”
                        Multiple layers of color-printing medium can be painted on a copperplate and
                        printed in one pull (see, for example, the ground beneath the figures in
                        plate 10 of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> copy F [illus.
                        7]). The crucial distinction is between colors printed from the plate and
                        those applied to individual impressions. The two can be differentiated on
                        the basis of their very different textures (see illus. 2). This is indeed
                        the case with <hi rend="i">The Song of Los.</hi> We can find nothing in
                        Dörrbecker that supports a two-pull process or is incompatible with a
                        one-pull process, yet a consideration of his comments leads Butlin to assert
                        that “exact registration is therefore hardly a consideration when
                        discussing Blake’s usual form of color-printing. . . .”
                        Further on in his essay he claims that “precise registration is not
                        in question.”<ref target="n12" type="note">3</ref> We contend that
                        exact registration is precisely the point, and we suspect that Phillips
                        would agree, given his statements that “multiple plate
                        colour-printing demanded exact registration” (96) and that
                        “Blake’s method also required precise registration”
                        (97). If the registration were not exact, then evidence for the second pull
                        would be easily observed throughout Blake’s color printing (illus.
                        1). It is self-contradictory to claim, on the one hand, that precise
                        registration is not the issue and tacitly admit, on the other hand, that
                        with one exception there is no evidence of imprecise registration in
                        Blake’s color-printed relief etchings. The issue is not decided only
                        on the basis of general “muzziness” (Butlin), but on specific
                        evidence provided by offset texts (even if one printing is only a subtle
                        blind embossment of the text), multiple platemarks, the nonparallelism of
                        white escarpment lines, and displacements between the image printed in the
                        first pull and the same image printed in any subsequent pull.<ref target="n13" type="note">4</ref> We can find such evidence throughout
                        the vast majority of eighteenth-century, nineteenth-century, and
                        twentieth-century prints that were printed in multiple pulls through the
                        press. With the sole exception of the impression of “Nurses
                        Song” noted above, we can find no such evidence in Blake’s
                        color prints. Hence, we conclude that he did not print his plates more than
                        once to create his color prints. We have verified this conclusion by
                        printing facsimiles and recreations of Blake’s relief etchings,
                        intaglio etchings, and monotypes in the <hi rend="i">à la
                            poupée</hi> method that replicate Blake’s various visual
                        and textural features (see illus. 5a, 6a, 13, 15, and 18, and in the print
                        version of “Inquiry,” see illus. 5a-b, 6, 11, 29, 33, 35a-c,
                        and in the online version, illus. 18-22, 26, 28, 49, 71-73, and 76). <note id="n12">3. Butlin has apparently changed his mind since 1995, when he
                            alluded to “perfect registration” in his review of
                            Viscomi’s book.</note><note id="n13">4. Butlin apparently believes that if you apply colors only
                            to the illustration and not the text, then only the illustration will
                            print and a slight misregistration (or “muzziness”)
                            won’t be noticeable. But the uncolored text still stands in
                            relief as the plate is reprinted and it subtly embosses the text,
                            flattening out the first printing and/or creating a slight halo effect
                            around the letters (see “Inquiry” illus. 10a in the print
                            version; 26 in the online version).</note></p>
          <p>Butlin next claims that, having “forgotten one of Viscomi’s
                        most important discoveries” about edition printing, we cast the
                        two-pull process “in its worst light by making it as complex as
                        possible.” He accuses us of assuming that Blake would have to wipe
                        the plate clean of ink before adding colors and then wipe colors before
                        adding more ink (“Inquiry” 80). Again, he appears not to have
                        read the “Inquiry”—or <pb id="p36-52" n="52"/>
                        Phillips—carefully. We are merely agreeing with Phillips (95, 101)
                        about what would be the necessary stages of production had Blake printed
                        plates twice, and we are explicit about why “Phillips is correct to
                        assume” these labor-intensive stages (82). In his
                        “Correction,” Phillips continues to say that the plate is
                        cleaned of ink and colors per pull. It is the advocates of the two-pull
                        theory who make Blake’s processes unnecessarily complex. They fail to
                        perceive that complexity by considering the two-pull process only as a
                        one-off activity that produces a single impression. It is by remembering
                        “one of Viscomi’s most important discoveries” that we
                        were led to follow out the consequences of the two-pull process as part of
                        edition printing—that is, a procedure in which multiple impressions
                        were printed from each plate before moving on to the next. When we
                        contextualized the two-pull process proposed by Phillips within edition
                        printing, we were ensnared within a labor-intensive, time-consuming, and
                        materials-wasting series of inking, printing, wiping off the ink, coloring,
                        registering, printing, wiping off the colors to ink the plate again,
                        printing . . . and on and on.<ref target="n14" type="note">5</ref><note id="n14">5. This was no mere thought experiment on our part. For
                            “Inquiry,” we actually used the two-pull process in the
                            studio, using Phillips as a guide, for about 45 minutes. At that point
                            we got very tired of its complexity. For the present essay, Viscomi
                            spent 22 hours in the print studio at the University of North Carolina
                            (16, 24, and 26 July 2002) and as many hours in his home studio printing
                            and coloring plates he made based on Blake’s designs and
                            conducting tests; at least ten hours were spent printing the plates in
                            the two-pull method. This experience (and previous experience at
                            multiple plate printing in the 1970s and 1980s) reconfirms his opinion
                            that for a work like <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of
                                Experience</hi> or <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi>, the
                            technique is tedious and slow, wastes materials, has a high error rate,
                            and, most importantly, provides no aesthetic gain.</note></p>
          <p>To avoid the complexity of Phillips’ two-pull method, Butlin advances
                        a new procedure. Instead of coloring the plate immediately after the first
                        pull and printing a second time, Butlin suggests printing all the plates in
                        a series in ink, and later printing “the same series of sheets with
                        his [Blake’s] thick color medium.” This would indeed be a
                        simpler process, but it actually makes registration more difficult. Indeed,
                        it would make impossible anything even approaching acceptable registration.
                        Unfortunately, to back up this observation will require us to descend, once
                        again, into a few technical details.</p>
          <p>Neither of the registration methods Phillips continues to advance, in his
                        “Correction,” would allow for the production process Butlin
                        proposes. If the printed sheet were held under the roller of the press after
                        the first pull in ink, then it could not be removed to allow for another
                        sheet to be printed in ink. Removing the sheet would quite obviously destroy
                        the possibility of keeping it firmly in place. If bottom-sheet registration
                        were used, then the registration for any one plate would be ruined when a
                        second plate was placed on the bed of the press for printing in ink. This is
                        because Blake’s plates differ in size and configuration, even within
                        a single illuminated book, and thus each plate would require a new bottom
                        sheet.</p>
          <p>We would like to see Butlin test his hypothesis in practice, for we cannot
                        imagine any method of registration that would be compatible with it, but let
                        us suppose there is one. Printing a series of ink impressions first, and
                        then returning to them to print in colors, implies a substantial amount of
                        time between these two activities, particularly if (as Butlin seems to
                        suggest) the ink is allowed to dry. During that interval, the dampened paper
                        would dry. It was standard practice for all professional plate printers in
                        Blake’s time to dampen the paper. We can be confident that Blake
                        continued this procedure in his printing from relief-etched plates because
                        of the consistent differences in the size of the plate impressions between
                        examples pulled by Blake himself and the posthumous prints pulled by
                        Frederick Tatham.<ref target="n15" type="note">6</ref> Lifetime pulls shrunk
                        as they dried. Tatham apparently did not dampen his paper and thus there was
                        no shrinkage. If Blake had allowed his inked impressions to dry before a
                        second pull, the image in those impressions would have been smaller than the
                        image on the copperplate. Registration would have been impossible. Wetting
                        the paper again would have been no help, since one cannot control the extent
                        to which a sheet of paper will shrink or stretch under varying degrees of
                        dampness and printing pressure except under scientifically controlled
                        conditions. <note id="n15">6. These measurable differences were first
                            pointed out in Bentley 67. We are confident that Bentley is right about
                            the origin of these differences: “The reason for this variation
                            may be that Blake and his wife dampened the paper when printing to get
                            the best possible impressions, and it subsequently shrank, while Tatham
                            did not dampen his posthumous pulls.”</note></p>
          <p>We regret that Butlin was confused by our overly abbreviated caption to
                        illus. 16 in the print version of our essay (illus. 36 in the online
                        version). By “printed colors <hi rend="i">painted</hi> over inked
                        relief lines” we were referring to the way in which the printed
                        colors in the impression of plate 1 from <hi rend="i">The First Book of
                            Urizen</hi> copy D were painted on to the copperplate (not on to the
                        impression) in such a way as to spill over both sides of the relief lines on
                        the copperplate. The point here is that Blake approached the coloring of the
                        plate in a painterly and imprecise way rather than in the exacting manner
                        required of precise registration. We hope that we did not mislead too many
                        readers on this point.</p>

                        turn guide the hand coloring of the plate. If they were wiped off between
                        pulls, as Phillips claims, then Blake was not only wasting colors and
                        preventing color build up—which allowed him to add less color in
                        subsequent printings—but was also repainting his plate in imitation
                        of his previously pulled impression. In the <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>
                        title plate impressions, these patterns are all the same in the areas that
                        were color printed, except that none of the other impressions has the date
                        covered. In all these sequential impressions, Blake has avoided printing
                        colors over the date, hooking them around the beginning of the date instead.
                        It is far more likely that Blake painted out the date directly on the copy
                            T<hi rend="s">1</hi> impression than that he interrupted his printing
                        process to color the area of the date on the copperplate in a new color for
                        a single impression. It is also unlikely that he could print a pigment that
                        ignored the physical laws of surface <pb id="p36-54" n="54"/><figure n="4a-d.date.100" rend="file"><head>4a-d. <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi>, title plate.</head><figDesc>Hand made relief etching based on Blake’s design, 12.8

                        escarpments that remain uncovered in the other impressions produced in the
                        same session.</p>
          <p>And finally, and most convincingly, there is the physical character of the
                        plate itself that would make covering the date by printing colors over
                        it—in one or two pulls—extremely difficult and extremely
                        obvious had it been done. Illus. 3 shows the structure of the plate, its
                        surface areas and shallows. Note that ink does not print at the base of the
                        relief lines or spaces between letters and lines, and this includes the
                        lines forming the numbers of the date. The pattern around the date resembles
                        that in the impressions of the <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> title plate in
                            <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> copies T<hi rend="s">1</hi>, F, and G (“Inquiry” illus. 20 and 21 in
                        the print version; 46a and 46b in the online version). Had the color hiding
                        the date actually been printed, there would be fine white lines around and
                        between the numbers. Unless Blake had previously built up colors in that
                        area and/or printed with undue pressure or with very thick colors (both of
                        which would cause splotching and filling up of lines), the escarpments
                        around these relief lines would be present whether the plate was color
                        printed in one pull (illus. 4a) or two pulls (illus. 4b), or if the second
                        pull had “been printed with less pressure” (illus. 4c), as
                        Phillips claims (“Correction”), or with more pressure (illus.
                            4d).<ref target="n17" type="note">8</ref> Knowing the structure of his
                        plate and the character of his printing technique, Blake also knew there was
                        no point in blotting out the date as part of his printing procedure when it
                        could be covered up more effectively during hand finishing—as were
                        the escarpments around the lines forming the pillars. <note id="n17">8.
                            Logic alone indicates that the colors over the date could not have been
                            printed separately with <hi rend="i">less</hi> pressure to create a top
                            layer above the ink since the colors were printed from the
                            plate’s shallows and not just its surface areas. Less pressure
                            would not have picked up all the colors from the shallows. Depending on
                            the depth of the plate, colors printed with less pressure would appear
                            thinner, not thicker, and have less rather than more covering
                            power.</note></p>
          <p>Phillips implies that the inked date hidden under opaque color is evidence
                        that the colors were applied separately. Otherwise, he concludes, the ink
                        would lie on top of colors as it presses into the paper. Butlin is explicit
                        about this supposed “sandwich” effect. He states that he is
                        convinced by our argument (his footnote 4) that a denser medium or a darker
                        color will always appear to be lying on top of a thinner medium or a lighter
                        color, as we demonstrated in our discussion of “Nurses Song,”
                        but he continues to believe that “ink lines” would appear to
                        be “lying on top of the denser colored areas” in a one-pull
                        process. Because we do not see this visual effect in Blake’s color
                        prints, he reasons that Blake printed the colors in a second, separate pull
                        through the press. But this is faulty reasoning. We do not see it in
                        one-pull printing because the colors are applied over the ink and are thus
                        mixed wet on wet with it. The result is that the colors often dominate the
                        ink. Intermixing of colors and <pb id="p36-55" n="55"/><figure n="5a-b.mhh.devil.100" rend="file"><head>5a-b. <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, plate

                        reinks over the colors and the colors are then reapplied over that ink. The
                        color-printed relief etching based on <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven
                            and Hell</hi> plate 10 (illus. 5) demonstrates this intermixing. The
                        plate was printed in black ink and various water-based colors
                        simultaneously; the colors painted over the ink on the wings and body of the
                        devil intermix with the ink and remain clearly on top (illus. 5a). Printing
                        this plate in two pulls, however, first in ink and then in colors, minimizes
                        intermixing, the result of which is a cleaner looking ink or outline (illus.
                        5b). This is true whether the ink is intaglio or relief, whether printed on
                        a press or by hand. We see the same contrast between relief etchings based
                        on the <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> title plate color printed in one and two
                        pulls (illus. 6a and 6b). This intermixing effect is seen throughout
                        Blake’s color prints (illus. 7; see also in the print version of
                        “Inquiry” illus. 9, 12, 16, 36, and in the online version,
                        illus. 25, 29, 36, 74, 75). By painting over some inked lines and leaving
                        others uncolored (painting within the lines, as it were), Blake could
                        continue to vary the tonality and textures of his color prints.</p>
          <p>At issue is the covering power of the colors. They have the most when applied
                        thickly as an opaque film on the impression, as illus. 2 demonstrates. They
                        cover less completely when intermixed with ink, as in one-pull printing

                        pull (illus. 5b and 6b). A cleaner or sharper outline is comparable to
                        Butlin’s “ink lines lying on top of the denser colored
                        areas.” In other words, what Butlin says should happen with one-pull
                        printing actually happens with two pulls. The facts that the intermixing of
                        colors and ink is present throughout Blake’s color prints—and
                        that sharper ink lines showing through colors is not—are further
                        evidence for one-pull and against two-pull printing.</p>
          <p>Butlin is also misled by the illusion created by thin washes applied on top
                        of printed colors. Thin, water-based colors are absorbed by unprinted areas
                        of the paper. At the same time, because of their different viscosities,
                        water-based colors tend to run off of oil-based ink or thick color-printing
                        medium. Thus, washes will appear to be <hi rend="i">under</hi> a dense
                        medium printed prior to the application of the washes. This is, pace Butlin,
                        a “provable fact,” and can be demonstrated without resorting
                        to “the miracles of modern technology.” Illus. 8 shows three
                        horizontal gray wash lines of various thickness that appear to lie under
                        thick, reticulated colors (burnt sienna and raw umber) printed from a plate
                        onto damp paper, but all three horizontal lines were applied with a brush
                            <hi rend="i">over</hi> the colors once they were dry. This illusion is
                        probably the reason why Richard Lloyd, “head of the print department
                        at Christie’s London,” observed that “in one place a
                        layer of watercolor has been added over the printing ink but under the
                        color-printed pigments” (Butlin) on an impression of <hi rend="i">The
                            Book of Urizen</hi> plate 3 sold by Christie’s London on 18
                        December 2001. Note the lack of specifics. Which “place” on
                        the print? What color is the wash? Is it thinner than the printed colors? We
                        have carefully inspected the <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> print in question (see
                        cover illus.). The thin grayish washes that outline the arms and legs do
                        indeed appear under the printed colors, but all were applied on top of
                            them.<ref target="n18" type="note">9</ref><note id="n18">9. The illusion, claimed by Phillips in his

          <p>One need not know how washes and colors interact or resort to facsimile
                        reproduction to realize how absurd the idea is that the watercolor washes on
                        the <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> print were applied <hi rend="i">before</hi> the
                        colors were printed. One need only think through the production process to
                        see how unworkable it is to apply colors by hand prior to finishing all
                        stages of the printing procedure. The text is lightly printed in a light
                        orange-yellow ochre ink. We have searched diligently, but we can find at
                        most only a few very small spots of this ink in the design area. The figure
                        and flames, the relief lines of which guided the coloring on the
                        copperplate, are defined primarily by the colors in which they were printed
                        (burnt sienna, raw umber, red, beige, and yellow-ochre pigments) rather than
                        the ink. Thus, if Blake had added washes to the design area before he color
                        printed it, he would be painting on what was virtually a blank piece of
                        paper. How did he determine where to place the finishing washes before there
                        was any image on the paper to finish? The purple-gray wash surrounding the
                        figure’s left forearm is clearly an attempt to fill in areas of the
                        arm where the color printing is weak or did not print at all (illus. 9). How
                        would Blake know that he needed to improve this area before the color
                        printing had been executed and its incompleteness on the arm made evident?
                        The black ink line, almost certainly added with a pen, that outlines the
                        upper edge of the figure’s right leg carefully follows the edge of
                        the color printing (illus. 10). There is no underlying orange-yellow ochre
                        ink printed in this area. How would Blake know where this fine pen and ink
                        line should be drawn prior to color printing? Adding handwork to a print is
                        always the last step, after all printing has been <pb id="p36-57" n="57"/><figure n="10.urizen.leg.100" rend="file"><head>10. William Blake, <hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen</hi>,

                        of handwork between printing operations creates unnecessary problems,
                        particularly when there is little if any image printed on the paper. All
                        such difficulties and complexities are avoided if, as we are convinced,
                        Blake printed the inked text and the color-printed image in one pull through
                        the press and later added the washes and pen and ink outlining. The fact
                        that this was the conventional sequence in Blake’s time does not
                        persuade us that Blake did not follow it.<ref target="n19" type="note">10</ref><note id="n19">10. Butlin states that “creating precise registration
                            . . . was indeed anything but a mechanical process”—which
                            is to misunderstand the material exigencies of printmaking and printing
                            because he equates “registration” with pen and ink
                            “outline” that is done on the impression after printing.
                            He argues that Blake was “forced to fill in the outlines in ink
                            or with the point of a brush” on many of his color-printed
                            impressions because the outline as printed was imprecise. He is right
                            about the printed line being less sharp and wiry, hence
                            “precise,” than hand-drawn pen and ink lines, which would
                            be true of impressions printed in one pull or two pulls. But he is wrong
                            to imply that we think that one-pull printing was
                            “precise” in this sense of the word and hence not in need
                            of hand finishing. We are very clear in “Inquiry” and in
                            its captions for illustrations that Blake finished his color prints in
                            watercolors and pen and ink. In short, registering a plate precisely to
                            an earlier impression from it is not the same thing as adding fine lines
                            and details in pen and ink on impressions. Butlin also equates a <hi rend="i">two-part</hi> or “double process” of printing
                            impressions and then coloring them in watercolors with a <hi rend="i">two-pull</hi> printing process. This analogy obscures the issue at
                            hand. Most image-making processes can be divided into multiple
                            activities; the question is where those divisions occur.</note></p>

          <p>Butlin faults us for not discussing the intaglio illuminated books, the
                        “independent color-prints” (i.e., the intaglio and relief
                        etchings color printed as part of the <hi rend="i">Large Book of
                            Designs</hi>), and the large color prints. He suggests that all these
                        provide strong evidence for two-pull printing of all of Blake’s color
                        prints. We disagree and take the opportunity to examine them now.</p>
          <p>Why Blake switched in 1795 to intaglio printing for the last two illuminated
                        books of the 1790s is a good question, but the idea that “the switch
                        was intended to make it easier to print by the two-pull process”
                        (Butlin) is not the answer. If that was Blake’s intention, why do <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi>
                        exist in one copy each? Why only eight color prints—counting

                        relief etchings? From this minority report, Butlin reasons that, if two
                        pulls here, then two pulls in everything leading up to it. Such logic should
                        give one pause, given how experimental Blake was as a painter and
                        printmaker, often engaging in methods that are unique to a single work (as
                        Butlin notes in his comments about <hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi> of
                        1793). In this matter, however, Blake was as consistent as Butlin supposes.
                        But this consistency resides in his continued use of one-pull printing.</p>
          <p>We have argued that Blake color printed his relief-etched plates by inking
                        the raised surfaces with a dabber and applying colors locally with brushes
                        and small dabbers to the inked surfaces and uninked shallows in the standard
                            <hi rend="i">à la poupée</hi> manner and then printing
                        raised surfaces and shallows simultaneously. Printing the two levels of an
                        intaglio plate simultaneously is a variation on this technique. Essick once
                        suspected otherwise, because he interpreted the colors extending beyond the
                        platemark in <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> title plate (illus. 11) as
                        signs of a second printing (<hi rend="i">Printmaker</hi> 130). What he now
                        realizes is that these colors were printed from the beveled edges of the
                        copperplate (illus. 12a, b). Because an intaglio plate requires more
                        pressure than surface printing, <pb id="p36-59" n="59"/><figure n="16.los.5.det.100" rend="file"><head>15. <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi>, copy A, plate 5.</head><figDesc>Handmade intaglio plate based on Blake’s design, 9.0

                        sharp edges and thereby prevent them from possibly tearing the paper. Illus.

                        plate 2. It is very easy to replicate the visual effect of colors spreading
                        past the platemark in <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi>—in fact, if
                        the colors are applied near the edge of the plate, it is very difficult to
                        prevent such spreading. Viscomi printed his replica of <hi rend="i">The Book

                        copperplate. Blake appears to have used the etched lines of <hi rend="i">Albion rose, The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Lucifer and the Pope in Hell</hi> only as guidelines for
                        coloring, since they appear to have no printed outlines in color-printed
                        impressions. Their outlines were added to the impressions with pen and
                        ink.</p>
          <p>We do not expect our images to substitute for a thousand words. Thus, it is
                        worth reviewing the contributions to what we know about color printing made
                        by the twentieth-century printmaker Stanley Hayter and others at Atelier 17
                        in Paris and New York: <q> Experiments combining surface and intaglio
                            methods of printing were made at Atelier 17 as early as 1930. The
                            earliest color prints at Atelier 17 were made by applying color with a
                            roller to the surface of an uninked intaglio plate, from which an
                            impression was made on paper. The plate <pb id="p36-60" n="60"/> was
                            then cleaned and inked for intaglio, and overprinted on the same paper.
                            Because this method presented the problem of registering the two
                            impressions exactly, the two steps were combined in a single printing by
                            first inking for intaglio and then adding a surface color by means of a
                            roller. (Moser 35) </q> Variations on “this simultaneous relief
                        and intaglio printing technique,” which Hayter referred to as
                        “simultaneous color printing,” included “the direct
                        wiping of certain areas with an ink soaked rag, or poupee,” which
                        “allowed the artist to use a variety of colors on a single
                        plate,” as well as the use of stencils, silk screens, inks of
                        different viscosities, and rollers of varying hardness to control the
                        placement of the relief colors (Moser 35-36; see also Hayter, <hi rend="i">New Ways of Gravure</hi> 158).<ref target="n20" type="note">11</ref>
                        However the colors were applied to the surface of the plate, <q> the
                            application of colours . . . was less important than the big idea of
                            combining all colours on one plate and printing it in one passage
                            through the press. Efficiency was not the only reason for adopting this
                            process; it gave imaginative artists an entirely different notion of
                            working in colour intaglio. New textural possibilities, new aesthetic
                            means of expression lay open. In the past, traditional colour aquatint
                            had appeared sporadically; after Hayter’s break-through, . . .
                            intaglio printing in colour began to burgeon and is now common practice.

                            rejected and adheres only to the surface surrounding the first ink. This
                            technique is usually referred to as “color viscosity
                            printing,” but Hayter considered that a misnomer and preferred to
                            call it “simultaneous color printing, making no distinction
                            between this technique and that used for other prints made with stencil,
                            silk screen, or offset colors” (Moser 38). Plates etched to
                            create relief areas and open shallows (called “open
                            etched,” “relief etched,” and “deep
                            etched” plates) could be inked with hard rollers for the surface
                            in an ink of one viscosity and softer rollers for the shallows in inks
                            of different viscosities. For more on Hayter’s experiments in
                            color printing and its origins, see Black and Moorhead’s
                            catalogue raisonné, <hi rend="i">The Prints of Stanley William
                                Hayter</hi> (15-16, and 23ff). The reproduction in this catalogue of
                            the print <hi rend="i">Jeux D’Eau</hi> (#208) from 1953 is of
                            particular interest to the present discussion because it was one of the
                            color prints produced from the same plate registered and printed twice.
                            Along the edges and corners ink slightly overlaps from the two printings
                            to reveal the registration. In other words, even a great printer like
                            Hayter in a first class workshop like Atelier 17 could not completely
                            hide the signs of registration. By the mid 1950s, Hayter
                            “stressed so strongly the advantages of printing color from a
                            single plate that an artist interested in printing from several plates
                            rarely did it at the workshop” (Moser 46).</note></p>
          <p>Simultaneous color printing was born out of the attempt to avoid “all
                        the difficulties of register,” which Hayter knew all too well (<hi rend="i">New Ways</hi> 159). In <hi rend="i">About Prints</hi>, he
                        describes various methods for registering plates, including pinholes, bottom
                        sheets, and pinching the paper with the press’s roller, and concludes
                        that “it is worthy to note that none of these methods is absolutely
                        precise” (58). Phillips continues to suggest that Blake might have
                        used the roller to hold his paper in place, despite our pointing out that
                        the sheets used in <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>
                        are too short for this method, given the circumference of the roller of his
                        press (“Inquiry” 95), and he suggests a variation on the
                        method in which the paper is held in place by a weight. Of the pinched sheet
                        method (and this would be true of its variant), Hayter states: “If
                        done carefully it is accurate to within 1/32 inch even on large plates, but
                        it is only applicable when printing wet on wet” (<hi rend="i">New
                            Ways</hi> 136). This means that the paper must be printed damp and
                        sequentially, and thus cannot be set aside as Butlin has suggested, and that
                        the best alignment one can hope for might fall below the threshold of vision
                        but will be detected by close scrutiny and magnification.<ref target="n21" type="note">12</ref> Our facsimile in “Inquiry” is this
                        good, but when examined under a magnifying glass it reveals the
                        characteristic ghosting of a second pull (see illus. 6 and 7a in the print
                        version; 20 and 21 online). Moreover, plates that pass through the press
                        twice look the part: “. . .it must be obvious that the full, sharp
                        relief can only be seen from the last plate printed, that of all other
                        plates having been flattened by subsequent passes through the press.”
                        And, as we noted in “Inquiry,” registering one plate on top of
                        another is “typical of the practice of a skilled artisan rather than
                        a process by which the original thought of the artist becomes visible
                        directly in a print” (Hayter, <hi rend="i">About Prints</hi> 58-59).
                            <note id="n21">12. Phillips was, he realizes now, too quick to accept
                            the notion that Blake produced four perfectly registered color prints
                            without signs of registration using just one pinhole, a technique never
                            before used for good reason. Common sense tells one that it cannot work;
                            at least two pinholes are required (see Hayter, <hi rend="i">About
                                Prints</hi> 57). Yet, not only was he willing to believe in
                            Blake’s use of this technique, but he claims the technique does
                            “work,” because he has tried it
                            (“Correction”). We are curious to know what he means by
                            “work” and to see the results. Are his registrations
                            acceptable or perfect and without any traces of the second
                        pull?</note></p>
          <p>It may come as a surprise to Butlin, as it did to Essick, that Hayter
                        believed that simultaneous printing in intaglio and surface colors <q> to
                            the layman . . . will seem so obvious that he will be surprised to hear
                            that it was not carried out successfully long before, as the advantages
                            of producing a full colour proof in a single operation, rather than
                            having to recommence the whole operation three or four times, are
                            obvious enough. Of course it had been tried before, and what happened to
                            the printer attempting it was probably what happened to us many times
                            during the fourteen years we spent developing this method. (<hi rend="i">About Prints</hi> 59-60) </q> His method as finally or fully
                        developed could be very complicated, involving multiple intaglio techniques
                        on a large plate (e.g., engraving, soft-ground, aquatint) and multiple roll
                        ups in relief inks of different viscosities (see note 11). But Hayter, who
                        was “among the first to admit that the fewest and simplest operations
                        should be used to achieve the <pb id="p36-61" n="61"/><figure n="17.colortest.los.100" rend="file"><head>17. Colors test, demonstrating different textures created by

                        technical problem as “surface colour shifting under the rolling
                        pressure of the press, [which] once clearly understood, was solved by
                        controlling the surface tension of the [relief] ink” (<hi rend="i">About Prints</hi> 61). For Blake, who used water-based colors instead
                        of relief inks, this meant making colors that could be applied thickly or
                        thinly to shallows or surfaces and which transferred to damp paper without
                        prominent splotching or smearing. As illus. 17 demonstrates, modifying the
                        composition of the colors can affect their surface tension and viscosity.
                        Too much or too little pigment, glue, ox gall, honey, whiting, or water in
                        the color makes for different visual qualities in the print, as do the type
                        and texture of the paper, the amount of size in it, and the amount of
                        pressure used in printing.<ref target="n22" type="note">13</ref> Painting
                        quickly and keeping the colors moist works well, but so does painting the
                        plates and letting them dry (which is inevitable for larger works), because
                        when printed onto damp paper under pressure the dried water-based colors are
                        reconstituted and will transfer to the paper. The color-printed replicas
                        reproduced here are of this second kind. <note id="n22">13. We do not know
                            the exact recipe for Blake’s colors, but we know that the vehicle
                            was glue and/or gum and not oil (pace Frederick Tatham; see Gilchrist
                            1:376 and Tatham’s letter in Rossetti 16). At least one large
                            color-print drawing has gum as the medium in which its colors were
                            suspended (see Essick, <hi rend="i">Printmaker</hi> 131, 259-60).
                            Additives like honey and ox gall (replaced today by glycerin and wetting
                            agents) impart moistness, prevent extreme caking and drying, and improve
                            the uniform flow of paints on surfaces, while whiting adds body to the
                            color (Mayer 300). The quality of the pigments and the size of the
                            particles to which they are ground also affect the behavior of the
                            colors. Blake’s pigments in color printing appear not to have
                            been ground very finely.</note></p>
          <p>We agree that the large color-print drawings (1795) and the Books of Designs
                        (1796) “represent a culmination of Blake’s color-printing
                        experiments.” But it is not as Butlin imagines. He sees
                        Blake’s development as moving from simple to complex, from small
                        relief etchings printed in one pull, to etchings and relief etchings printed
                        in two pulls, to large color prints produced in two pulls and elaborately
                        finished in watercolors and pen and ink.<ref target="n23" type="note">14</ref> The development, however, was towards greater simplicity, from
                        printing a combination of oil-based ink and water-based colors from two
                        levels of one plate to the planographic printing of just water-based colors
                        from the surface of a support. Technically, the color-printed <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi> is the vignette from <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi>
                        title plate writ large: the unprinted intaglio line was used as a guide for
                        painting the surface of the plate in colors that were printed onto damp
                        paper and finished in watercolors and pen and ink. The large color-print
                        drawings are, technically, <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi> writ large, in that
                        the colors were painted on a flat support. The outline of the design was
                        probably drawn on a gessoed millboard (though copper was used for at least
                        one design) in India ink, which would adhere permanently to the support and
                        not transfer to the paper.<ref target="n24" type="note">15</ref> The
                        composition was painted in colors using brushes and dabbers and printed onto

                        composition, the latter in thin layers of dried colors on the support after
                        printing, could be returned to years later and the process repeated.<ref target="n25" type="note">16</ref><note id="n23">14. Butlin does not explicitly say so, but he implies that
                            the large color prints were printed in two pulls, first in outline and
                            then in colors. In earlier statements, he implies that Blake used both a
                            two-pull and a one-pull procedure: “In some cases, such as <hi rend="i">God Judging Adam</hi>, Blake seems to have printed a
                            monochrome outline of his design before over-printing it in his tacky,
                            tempera-like medium, a process akin to that used in the colour-printed
                            examples of his books. . . . In others only colour-printing can be
                            detected” (<hi rend="i">Paintings and Drawings</hi> 1:156). He
                            makes the same point in his “Physicality” essay
                            (4-5).</note><note id="n24">15. The outline may also have been drawn in watercolor and
                            covered over in a thin film of transparent varnish or gum Arabic, which
                            would prevent it from printing and assist in transferring colors from
                            the support. Gum Arabic is used in this manner today in printing
                            monotypes in watercolors. Millboard, the thick kind used in binding
                            books, would have to be sealed with a glue or gesso to prevent the
                            watercolors from being absorbed into the board. The idea that the
                            patterns in the gesso may have contributed to the spongy appearance of
                            the color print or parts of it was suggested to Viscomi by Beth
                            Grabowski, Professor of Art at the University of North Carolina, who
                            teaches printmaking. To test this hypothesis, impressions from the same
                            board color printed in 1795 and c. 1804-1805 would need to be examined
                            minutely. Identical patterns of reticulation in two such examples would
                            suggest that they were produced by the surface structure of the gesso on
                            the board.</note><note id="n25">16. It is interesting to note that Blake provided his chief
                            patron, Thomas Butts, with a set of the large color-print drawings in
                            1805, some printed on paper dated 1804, and a copy of <hi rend="i">Songs
                                of Innocence and of Experience</hi> (copy E) in 1806. In the latter
                            case, he returned to sets of impressions printed 1789, c. 1794, and 1795
                            and finished them in watercolors and pen and ink. With the color prints,
                            he did something very similar. Instead of executing new images, he
                            returned to his series of painted boards executed in 1795 and repainted
                            some of them to produce new impressions, dating them
                            “1795” in pen and ink.</note></p>

          <p>The color-print drawings are monoprints, in that the impressions pulled from
                        the painted surface are not exactly repeatable. The monoprints reproduced
                        here were executed in the method described above. Illus. 18 is a recreation
                        of <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi> before finishing, printed without outlines
                        in one pull in undiluted watercolors from the surface of a sheet of 1/16
                        inch plexiglass in place of an intaglio plate. Illus. 19 is a color print of
                        a still life printed in watercolors from a 3/32 inch gessoed board (illus.
                        20) with India ink outline, which did not print. If dark outlines are wanted
                        with the colors, they need only be applied with them, over the India ink
                        outline, as another monoprint from a different gessoed board demonstrates
                        (illus. 21). Blake appears to have used the method more for its textural
                        possibilities (illus. 21) than its reproductive potential. However, he could
                        print two or three impressions from a well-painted plate or board before
                        having to replenish <figure n="19.color.print1.100" rend="file"><head>19. Joseph Viscomi, <hi rend="i">Circles out of the

                        are usually lighter and less intense than the first impression (illus. 22
                        and 23). Increasing pressure for the subsequent prints helps to secure a
                        good impression but is not absolutely necessary (it was not done for the
                        maculatures here, but was done for a third still life impression). Many of
                        the color-printed illuminated plates (relief etchings and intaglio etchings)
                        have maculatures (see “Inquiry” illus. 12, 13 in the print
                        version; 29-32 online).</p>
          <p>In <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi>, Butlin claims correctly that Blake did
                        not repaint “his plate before taking each impression. In at least
                        some cases Blake seems to have printed two or even three copies of a print
                        without renewing his application of paint to the plate, each impression
                        being therefore weakened in intensity” (83). He does not, however,
                        explain how the second impression is compatible with two-pull printing, nor
                        does he or Phillips appear to realize that maculatures undermine the entire
                        hypothesis of two-pull printing. Neither addresses the issue of maculatures
                        directly and thus they appear to assume that the maculatures of relief and
                        intaglio etchings and, for Butlin, of the large color prints were also
                        printed in two pulls, one for the outline and then for the <figure n="23.color.print.2.100" rend="file"><head>23. Joseph Viscomi, <hi rend="i">Circles out of the
                                Basket.</hi></head><figDesc>Monoprint, printed in water-based colors in one pull. Second

                        the maculatures are diminished because they come from the plate just
                        printed; they show, in other words, that there was printable color left on
                        the plate or board from the first pull (even if replenished in some areas).
                        Thus, the relief or intaglio etching or board was not cleaned of all colors
                        in order to print the outline only. Rather, it was printed again, without
                        intervening steps, to produce a second impression. This second impression,
                        from the same plate, is necessarily one pull. Why then would Blake go
                        through all the trouble of registration when a good impression could be
                        produced from the plate in one pull? That second impression again
                        demonstrates the efficacy of one-pull printing.</p>
          <p>The core question in this discussion about color printing is not whether
                        relief or intaglio plates <hi rend="i">could</hi> be registered (of course
                        they can—though certainly not with just one pin-hole), but whether
                        they could be registered consistently without <hi rend="i">ever</hi> showing
                            <hi rend="i">any traces</hi> of that registration. We have argued that
                        traces of the second pull are always present if one knows how and where to
                        look, and have argued from much practice in the printing of both intaglio
                        and relief-etched plates, from the close examination of Blake’s
                        prints, and from the practice of many other printmakers. We have also argued
                        and demonstrated that both intaglio and relief-etched plates can be printed
                        from both their surfaces and incised lines and shallows simultaneously, and
                        that water-based colors can be used with oil-based inks. Blake pioneered
                        these printing and etching techniques as well as the monoprint and the
                        modern concept of the color print as an aesthetic work equal to painting. A
                        question we asked in “Inquiry” is worth repeating: why do in
                        an intricate and expensive way (two-pull printing) what can be done directly
                        and more simply and less expensively (one-pull printing)? As Hayter and
                        other printmakers knew, there is no aesthetic gain from printing the plates
                        twice. Butlin and Phillips do not claim that Blake could not do what he did
                        in one pull or that two <pb id="p36-64" n="64"/> pulls made for better
                        images. They merely keep asserting, without solid evidence and without
                        refuting our counter-evidence, that Blake consistently used two-pull
                        printing.</p>
          <p>Butlin’s concluding paragraph returns to the theme with which he
                        began. We have indulged in too much technical detail, focused over-much on
                        the primary evidence, and this has blinded us to larger issues. Only general
                        knowledge, painted with a broad brush, is allowed. We find this approach
                        unsatisfactory for the study of printing technology. Surveys of
                        Blake’s artistic development must neither ignore nor contradict
                        material facts. Indeed, one can speculate on the meaning and aesthetic
                        qualities of an art work, but to ascertain its medium, whether the colors
                        are oil or water based, the support paper or canvas, the plate an engraving
                        or a mezzotint, the print pulled once or twice through a press, it is the
                        material facts, discerned by chemical analysis, x-rays, magnification,
                        hands-on experiments, computer enhancement, and other research aids, that
                        will prove most objective and helpful. Avoiding Minute Particulars will not
                        lead to the Palace of Wisdom.</p>

                        next day at the Tate reception, there were no broad-brimmed black
                        hats—indeed, there were no hats at all. But if Blake had been there,
                        or Gully Jimson either, what would he have made of it all?—the
                        discrete sponsors leading off the quadrille, the cataracts of champagne, and
                        room after deftly-lighted room exhibiting a plethora of his works such as
                        the quiet artist-engraver had never seen assembled in one place. Indeed,
                        some of these works had never been in the same room together, and a number
                        of them <pb id="p36-65" n="65"/><figure n="CanterburyDetail.36.2.bqscan" rend="file"><head>1. Detail of William Blake, “Chaucers Canterbury

                        more.</p>
          <p>Of course he would have been dazzled by the generosity of lenders throughout
                        the English-speaking world—thirtytwo in Britain (mostly the British
                        Library [28], the British Museum Print Room [54], the Tate [37], and the
                        Fitzwilliam Museum [25]); eleven in the United States, three in Canada, and
                        one in Australia.</p>
          <p>He might have been as curious as we to compare the coloring of early and late
                        copies of, say, his <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>, to see how the
                        Great Color Prints have withstood the ravages of time (often brilliantly),
                        and how the seasons have assailed his beloved temperas (sometimes
                        lamentably).</p>
          <p>But most of all he might have marveled at these bank directors and
                        advertising executives and luminaries of fashion assembled to dine at the
                        table of William Blake. Blake’s own private exhibition in 1809 in his
                        brother’s hosiery shop may not have attracted more than three or four
                        viewers at a time—indeed, we know of no occasion when there were as
                        many as four there at once. William Blake as a culture or cult hero of the
                        Establishment would have bemused or bewildered the man who wrote of the
                        world of Pitt and Paine in 1798—and could have written of the world
                        of Blair and Bush in 2001—“The Beast &amp; the Whore rule
                        without control.”<ref target="n28" type="note">3</ref><note id="n28">3. Marginalium (1798) to Watson’s <hi rend="i">Apology
                                for the Bible</hi> (1797) (<hi rend="i">William Blake’s
                                Writings</hi> [1978] 1404).</note></p>
          <p>Have Blake’s arts reduced the power of the Whore and the
                        Beast—or have his arts been perverted, so that the
                        “Jerusalem” hymn becomes in 1917 a war song to Englishmen and
                        the state itself fosters in 2000 the arts of the most eloquent anarchist in
                        England?</p>
          <p>Most of those who enjoy Blake’s works have to make do with not-as-good
                        substitutes, from facsimiles to mere “reproductions” to (even
                        though we know better) editions of his works in Illuminated Printing without
                        pictures. The opportunity to see the real thing is rare, for the originals
                        are scattered from Vienna (Austria) to the National Gallery of Victoria
                        (Australia).</p>
          <p>As a consequence, a Blake exhibition such as the enormous one at Tate Britain
                        is a rare treat, though a treat which is becoming less rare. Since Martin
                        Butlin organized the great Blake exhibition at the Tate in 1978, there have
                        been important Blake exhibitions in Toronto and New Haven (1982-83), Tokyo
                        (1990), Barcelona and Madrid (1996), and even Helsinki (2000). Perhaps if
                        you just sit still a major Blake exhibition will come to your own hamlet. Or
                        perhaps not.</p>
          <p>The Tate Blake exhibition of 2000-2001 was certainly a major exhibition,
                        mounted with enormous éclat and puffery. It included almost all
                        Blake’s works in Illuminated Printing, sometimes in several copies
                        and sometimes with each plate separately exhibited (as in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> [E]). They included <hi rend="i">All Religions Are
                            One</hi> (A—the only known copy), <hi rend="i">America</hi> (C,
                        F), <hi rend="i">Book of Los</hi> (A, unique), <hi rend="i">Book of

                            Urizen</hi> (D), <hi rend="i">For Children: The Gates of Paradise</hi>
                        (E), “Laocoön” (B), <hi rend="i">Marriage of Heaven
                            and</hi> Hell (E, L-M), <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (A, E), <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (L), <hi rend="i">Song of Los</hi> (B), <hi rend="i">Songs
                            of Innocence</hi> (F), <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and
                            Experience</hi> (B, E-F-G, T<hi rend="s">1</hi>), <hi rend="i">There is
                            No Natural Religion</hi> (L), and <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters
                            of Albion</hi> (a, D). Among Blake’s major manuscripts there were
                        his Notebook, <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> or <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, and
                            <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi>, but not the unillustrated Ballads
                        Manuscript.</p>
          <p>The drawings included those for <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> (all the nine known
                        surviving watercolors), Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> (8),
                        Gray’s <hi rend="i">Poems</hi> (5), Chaucer, Dante (29), <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> (11 of 12 from the Thomas set), <hi rend="i">L’Allegro</hi> and <hi rend="i">Il Penseroso</hi>, the Large
                        Blake-Varley Sketchbook and the Large Book of Designs.<ref target="n29" type="note">4</ref><note id="n29">4. The exhibition and catalogue do not, however, include <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> and <hi rend="i">Descriptive
                                Catalogue</hi> (which are not illustrated) or the Bunyan designs,
                            and they have only two of the scores of Visionary Heads.</note></p>
          <p>It is wonderful to be able to see the real thing—but some of these
                        works are not the real thing. Exhibits 111a-d are copperplates made and
                        printed by Michael Phillips, and #103 is a rolling press with arms about
                        9’ high, much higher than the ceiling of the only surviving room in
                        which Blake printed, in his cottage at Felpham.</p>
          <p>The most rewarding of the exhibits were those which cannot be adequately
                        reproduced, either because of their size or because of their medium. Most
                        impressive among the originals of the watercolors are the “Vision of
                        the Last Judgement,” 20” × 15½” (#59,
                        Petworth House), “An Allegory of the Spiritual Condition of
                        Man,” 59 5/8” × 47 ¾” (#60), and
                        Chaucer’s Canterbury Pilgrims tempera, 18 3/8” × 53
                        15/16” (#62). But the most extraordinary effect is made by the
                        complete series of twelve Large Colour Prints (#241-52) which have rarely
                        been seen together—even Butts, his chief <pb id="p36-66" n="66"/>
                        patron at the time, did not have a complete set. They are enormous, c.
                        18” × 24”, no method of reproducing their
                        three-dimensional effects is at all satisfactory, and their cumulative
                        effect is well-nigh overwhelming.</p>
          <p>The exhibition was organized chiefly by Robin Hamlyn, and the catalogue is a
                        worthy memorial of the exhibition. The pro forma essays by Peter Ackroyd<ref target="n30" type="note">5</ref> and Marilyn Butler<ref target="n31" type="note">6</ref> are remarkable for little more than good will. <note id="n30">5. Ackroyd’s “William Blake: The Man” (pp.
                            11-13) is notable for his knighting of “Sir William
                            Hayley” (p. 13), rectifying an omission by George III.</note><note id="n31">6. Marilyn Butler, “Blake in his Time” (pp.
                            15-25) speaks of Blake’s “death at seventy” (p. 14:
                            he was 69), “his first volume of poems (<hi rend="i">Songs of
                                Innocence</hi>, 1789)” (p. 14: his “first volume of
                            poems” was <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> [1783]),
                            “the busy printing house of the publisher Joseph Johnson”
                            (p. 17: Joseph Johnson had no printing house; he farmed his books to
                            numerous printers), and “Blake’s paganism” (p.
                            19).</note></p>
          <p>The catalogue<ref target="n32" type="note">7</ref> is very generously
                        illustrated, though the reproductions vary capriciously in size; for
                        instance, the <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> designs are reproduced in three
                        radically different sizes, though the originals are all approximately the
                        same size. The reproductions include all those known for <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> (9), 29 for Dante, 8 for <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (A), <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (L-M) entire, 9 from <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>
                        (B), 16 from <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (E), and 22 from the Bible. <note id="n32">7. <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi> (London: Tate, 2000)

                            Martin Postle, Martin Myrone, Michael Phillips, Noa Cahaner McManus, and
                            Robin Hamlyn. The Abrams version adds a “Checklist of Works
                            Exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art” (pp. 299-304), with
                            far fewer works than in the Tate exhibition and some
                        additions.</note></p>
          <p>The catalogue is useful and responsible. However, Richard Edwards was
                        scarcely “the leading London bookseller” (p. 52), though his
                        brother James might be so described, and Boydell’s Shakspeare Gallery
                        was not “abandoned” (p. 52).</p>
          <p>The most original part of the catalogue is Michael Phillips, “The
                        Furnace of Lambeth’s Vale” (pp. 98-171). He claims, as he does
                        in his <hi rend="i">William Blake: The Creation of the</hi> Songs <hi rend="i">From Manuscript to Illuminated Printing</hi> (London: British
                        Library, 2000), with many of the same reproductions, that the proprietary
                        chapel built in 1793 in Lambeth was “built on the village
                        green” (p. 145), as background for “The Garden of
                        Love,” but he offers no evidence that it was indeed on the village
                        green, as is the plain intent of “The Garden of Love” (1794),
                        and there is no village green on the map of Lambeth which he reproduces (p.
                        145). In the anti-Paine riots in October 1793, “The fires would have
                        been clearly seen from . . . Hercules Buildings” where Blake lived
                        (p. 154), but no evidence is offered. “Clearly, any ambitions that
                        Blake had to engage publicly in the debate provoked by the events in France
                        had been suppressed” in the autumn of 1793 (p. 154), but Blake
                        produced <hi rend="i">America</hi> (1793), <hi rend="i">Songs of
                            Experience</hi> (1794), <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (1794), and <hi rend="i">Song of Los</hi> (1795), in each of which an assiduous informer
                        could easily have found generous evidence for his sympathies with
                        revolutionary France. And Dr. Phillips insists (e.g., p. 107), as he does in
                            <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi> (2000), that Blake’s color prints
                        passed through the press twice, once with the basic design in monochrome and
                        a second time with the colors.<ref target="n33" type="note">8</ref> Most
                        Blake scholars doubt his conclusion. <note id="n33">8. The argument is based
                            in significant part on evidence which does not exist; see Robert N.

          <p>Michael Phillips’ engaging account of the origins, early history, and
                        production of the <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>
                        bristles with startling insights, fresh perspectives, and new discoveries,
                        but important aspects of its most prominent arguments are simply wrong. The
                        idea behind it is outstanding: to review the publishing, political, and
                        aesthetic contexts in which the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> arose, to
                        reconstruct as far as possible the stages in which they were composed, and
                        to detail the physical processes by which Blake actually produced the books,
                        all accompanied by compelling images of relevant documents, tools, and other
                        visual materials, many in color. In many ways the promise of this concept is
                        admirably fulfilled. The writing is clear, bracing and energetic, the
                        typography and layout are attractive and readable, and the illustrations are
                        fresh, plentiful, well chosen and clear. The book includes more than two
                        dozen large full-color images of pages from particular copies of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, many of which have not been reproduced elsewhere.
                        Given all these positive characteristics, it is unfortunate that it is
                        marred throughout by major and minor errors in interpreting the complex
                        evidence about how Blake created the <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of
                            Experience.</hi></p>
          <pb id="p36-67" n="67"/>
          <p>Phillips begins to establish the formative context and origins of these poems
                        by adducing two interesting books of prints from his personal collection
                        that Blake may have owned and doodled on as an adolescent. These
                        aren’t shown to be especially relevant to the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, either in themselves or because of Blake’s putative
                        additions to them, but they do effectively suggest the potential range of
                        his early interests, and it is tantalizing to see a few pages from them.
                        Phillips then focuses more narrowly on <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>,
                        reviewing early Blake poems copied (by someone other than Blake) into a copy
                        of <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> and also lyrics in the dramatic
                        satire <hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon</hi>, of which Phillips published
                        a sumptuous and scholarly facsimile edition in 1986. Certain of these are
                        versions of poems that later appeared in <hi rend="i">Songs of
                            Innocence</hi>, and others explore related themes in ways that
                        illuminate Blake’s developing sense of the topography of both
                        Innocence and Experience. Although some poems probably had versions even
                        earlier than the fairly polished drafts we see recorded in these mss., and
                        any or all could have been adapted to the contexts in which they appear
                        rather than being steps in a straightforward evolutionary process
                        culminating in the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, Phillips’ account of the
                        poetic process is generally persuasive and consistently illuminating.
                        Knowing what a poem used to be or where it came from should not determine
                        our understanding of what it became, but this chapter makes an excellent
                        case for reading poems in their developmental context.</p>
          <p>Some troublesome issues arise two chapters later as Phillips conducts the
                        reader through the much more complicated documents that underlie the etched
                        texts of the <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience.</hi> These are more clearly
                        drafts in development even if some may have been copied into Blake’s
                        Notebook from still earlier unrecorded versions, and most contain
                        discernable (but not easily distinguishable) layers of revision in addition
                        to plentiful false starts, dead ends and other expected signs of poetry
                        caught early in the creative process. When the late David V. Erdman
                        documented these changes in his editions of Blake and of the Notebook, he
                        only described the sequence of marks that overlap, and didn’t specify
                        a chronology of creation and revision or attempt to sort out broad layers of
                        changes made about the same time. Phillips undertakes to do both, but the
                        resulting account of Blake’s process of composition and revision is
                        rife with dubious assertions—the broad outlines of the process
                        Phillips describes are plausible and the narrative as a whole provides a
                        very useful perspective, but much of what he specifies about the mechanics
                        and chronology of composition and revision is unlikely and most is
                        impossible to confirm.</p>
          <p>Part of the problem is that although Phillips’ account is not overtly
                        polemical, it is more tendentious than it first appears to be: throughout
                        the book, the descriptions of Blake’s creative and printing processes
                        are skewed by misconceived reaction to the portrait of Blake as a maker of
                        illuminated books promulgated by Robert N. Essick in <hi rend="i">William
                            Blake, Printmaker</hi> (1980) and <hi rend="i">William Blake and the
                            Language of Adam</hi> (1989) and even more emphatically by Joseph
                        Viscomi in <hi rend="i">Blake and the Idea of the Book</hi> (1993). Essick
                        and Viscomi represent Blake as an heroic and ingenious inventor of means by
                        which the poet/artist is freed from the drudgery and mechanization that
                        dominate creativity in conventional book production. In their view,
                        Blake’s methods maximize artistic control, spontaneity, and the ratio
                        of productivity to uncreative labor. When Viscomi described the process of
                        making illuminated plates in 1993, he was especially concerned with
                        debunking critical corollaries to the persistent myth that in making his
                        plates Blake mechanically transferred finished calligraphic texts to the
                        copper after they were actually written on something else. In that context
                        Viscomi noted that when writing on the copper Blake could have recorded
                        spontaneous effusions of verse or created designs directly on the plate,
                        without any drafting or premeditation. But when Viscomi wrote of Blake
                        regularly “composing” text and pictures on the copper he
                        referred not to literary or graphic invention (as Phillips seems to think)
                        but to the arrangement (and adaptation) of pictorial and textual material on
                        the page.<ref target="n34" type="note">1</ref> Some of the shaggiest
                        passages of such later prophecies as <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> could have been invented wholesale as Blake
                        recorded them on copper, but nobody has ever argued that Blake wrote the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> without drafts. The critical point that both Essick
                        and Viscomi were trying to make was that every stage of making a Blake book
                        was a fresh performance by the artist, whereas in conventional bookmaking
                        there is almost always at least one stage that is at best a simulacrum of a
                        performance that has been fixed at an earlier stage and in another medium,
                        as when a commercial engraver copies a design by an artist or a compositor
                        makes a copy in type from fair copy in the poet’s hand.<ref target="n35" type="note">2</ref><note id="n34">1. See esp. chapter 3, “Illuminated Printing as
                            Composing Process,” Viscomi 26-31.</note><note id="n35">2. The engraver or compositor in conventional book production
                            may be an artist in his or her own right, and may have considerable
                            control, but nothing like what Essick and Viscomi call Blake’s
                            “autographic” command of processes and content.</note></p>
          <p>In a move that is characteristic of this book, Phillips undertakes to set
                        Essick and Viscomi straight about the means of production by showing how
                        hard Blake appears to have worked on drafting the proto-<hi rend="i">Songs</hi> in the Notebook, as if they were claiming that
                        Blake’s poems, including the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, were all
                        communicated to him by spirits while he worked on the copper. Just as he
                        seems to misunderstand “composition” of texts and designs,
                        Phillips treats the word “autographic,” used by both Essick
                        and Viscomi to describe the way Blake produced the printed texts and designs
                        for his books, as a synonym for “automatic,” as in
                        “automatic writing”: Phillips writes, “The manuscript
                        drafts, both in <hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon</hi> and in the <hi rend="i">Manuscript Notebook</hi>, make clear that Blake did not write
                        autographically, unpremeditated or from any form of dictation divine or
                        otherwise” <pb id="p36-68" n="68"/> (111).<ref target="n36" type="note">3</ref> The word “autographic” actually means
                        “written in the author’s own hand,” and to the extent
                        that it is related to the issue of volition it means that the author is
                        more, not less, in control of what appears in the published book. <note id="n36">3. Ominously, Phillips has communicated his confusion to the
                            reviewer Vincent Carretta, who concludes that “the evidence for
                            the evolution of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> . . . renders this notion
                            of ‘Blake’s autographic mode of graphic
                            composition’ no longer tenable” (443).</note></p>
          <p>The misdirection of the argument about composing on copper is complemented by
                        systematic errors in interpreting the manuscript drafts of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> that make it appear that Blake, far from being in control,
                        was both inattentive and irrational. Ironically, because Phillips is so
                        diligent about specifying what he supposes to be the minutiae of the
                        creative process (and so careful to provide the materials that we need to
                        corroborate his narrative), it quickly becomes apparent that he is not
                        entirely reliable as a guide through the editorial thickets of the Notebook
                        drafts. In most of these erroneous reconstructions, Phillips treats
                        tentative moves by Blake that were rejected immediately or overwritten as if
                        they were still part of the context as Blake moved on with an entirely
                        different thought in mind. To take one example, in reconstructing the
                        “first draft” of “I laid me down upon a bank”
                        (36), Phillips has Blake writing “Triven” for
                        “Driven” in the last line. Are we to suppose that
                        Blake’s first inspiration was to invent a nonsense word, then thought
                        better of it after he finished the poem? Isn’t it more likely that he
                        abandoned a word beginning with “T” and wrote
                        “Driven” on top of it, then went on to the rest? This
                        isn’t an important error by itself, but as the instances multiply one
                        realizes that Blake is being treated more like an oblivious telegraph clerk
                        than a poet.<ref target="n37" type="note">4</ref><note id="n37">4. To take another example, in reconstructing the
                            “first draft” of the poem “I asked a thief”
                            on page N114 of the Notebook, Phillips offers a neat draft of the whole
                            poem ending with a nonsense phrase, “And twixt earnest &amp;
                            game / He enjoyd the dady.” Later, Phillips reports, as part of a
                            general scheme of revision, Blake revised it to read, “And twixt
                            earnest &amp; joke / Enjoyd the Lady,” correcting
                            “dady” to read “Lady” (38-39). I think
                            Phillips has grievously misinterpreted a harmless over-reading by
                            Erdman, thereby producing editorial hash. In transcribing the poem for
                            his 1965 edition of Blake, Erdman supposed he saw vestiges of a
                            “d” at the beginning of the word “Lady” and
                            guessed, in his impetuous way, that Blake must have first written
                            “dame” to rhyme with “game” (itself a very
                            speculative reading, perhaps suggested by an initial “g”
                            that seems to be underlying the “j” of
                            “joke”) and then later changed it to “Lady.”
                            In his edition of the Notebook and in his 1981 revised edition of Blake,
                            Erdman corrected his account of the revision, recognizing that the
                            letters “me” were never written, but he still reported
                            “da[me],” that is, an abortive “dame”
                            rejected even before the poet finished writing it, with
                            “Lady” written on top of it. I think Erdman’s
                            “da[me]” was a figment of his fertile editorial
                            imagination: more likely, Blake initially wrote “lady” and
                            then, either immediately or sometime later, capitalized it with his
                            usual majuscule “L,” which has a leftward loop in the
                            lower corner, thus producing something that looks like a
                            “d” made up of that loop and the superimposed stems of the
                            “l” and “L.” The hypothetical Blake who
                            inhabited Erdman’s head when he examined manuscripts was
                            creative, logical, and purposive, his mind bursting with synonyms and
                            potential rhymes as he writes. The hypothetical Blake who writes
                            “enjoyd the dady” is as unaware of what he is producing as
                            a numb-fingered recruit from the typing pool. Similar improbabilities
                            are specified as fact in transcribing “Thou hast a lap” on
                            N111 (Phillips 52), where Phillips leaves “can” in line 3
                            of the second stanza, though it is much more likely that the word would
                            have been deleted before he wrote it again in the next line. In line 3
                            of “The Earth’s Answer,” also on N111 (52),
                            Phillips has Blake writing “Her eyes fled dead” in the
                            position of a tri-syllabic line; even if we assume that Blake had not
                            yet determined the metrical structure when he drafted the first stanza,
                            he would at least have settled on “eyes fled” or
                            “orbs dead” (another rejected reading) before writing the
                            rest of the poem, and it makes no sense to offer a
                            “reconstructed” draft of the poem containing meaningless
                            and mis-metrical scraps of both readings at once. Once one starts
                            looking closely at these editorial reconstructions one can quickly find
                            as many more that are down-right impossible, as well as numerous
                            instances in which more plausible alternative reconstructions are
                            neglected. It does not help that there are also several annoying typos
                            in Phillips’ transcriptions that suggest the intervention of an
                            officious electronic automaton rather than flawed editorial methods:
                            e.g. “new moan hay” on pages 39 and 41,
                            “jealously” on both 52 and 53. (In his
                            “Corrigenda” of 2001 Phillips lists other errors in the
                            book—see “Works Cited.”)</note></p>
          <p>In spite of the problems in interpreting manuscript particulars,
                        Phillips’ reconstruction of the broad stages of composition of <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> is usually sharp and suggestive.
                        Examining the reconstructed drafts helped me to understand the poems better
                        even when I was most skeptical about his specific reasoning, and if taken
                        with a grain of salt this part of the book would be a very useful resource
                        for anyone studying the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> at any level. The elaborate
                        foregrounded evidence of pens, ink, and writing sessions is a minor
                        distraction from the more important story Phillips has to tell about the
                        these poems.<ref target="n38" type="note">5</ref> Furthermore, Phillips has
                        a gift for finding and presenting compelling illustrative evidence, and many
                        of the photographs, flyers, and other historical documents that he offers in
                        conjunction with the primary texts are important and illuminating as well as
                        eye-catching. (A different problem arises with one of these—see
                        Appendix.) <note id="n38">5. I agree with Phillips that the Notebook drafts
                            reflect several stages of revision, but his stroke-by-stroke account of
                            multiple pens and inks is more positive in its assertions than my
                            experience with sharply pointed quill pens and period inks would allow

                            variable characteristics, even at a sitting, if the pen is set down,

          <p>Following each of the chapters detailing the development of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> in draft are chapters describing Phillips’ version of
                        the processes by which Blake produced the printed versions of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> and then <hi rend="i">Experience.</hi> The
                        material here has already generated considerable controversy, so I will not
                        attempt more than a perfunctory review of the problems as I see them.
                        Phillips’ account of the publication process appears at first to be
                        an objective exposition building upon previous scholarship and
                        experimentation, and much of it is exactly that, but once again a misguided,
                        partially covert, polemic against <hi rend="i">Blake and the Idea of the
                            Book</hi> bubbles up at critical points in the discussion. Viscomi
                        emphasized not only the “autographic” aspect of Blake’s
                            <pb id="p36-69" n="69"/> methods of creating printable text on plates,
                        but also the efficiency of the techniques used to print from those plates,
                        techniques which similarly freed the artist from mechanistic drudgery.
                        Viscomi pointed out evidence of small-scale mass production everywhere in
                        Blake’s illuminated canon, and showed that even though copies of
                        illuminated books are often quite different from each other, Blake’s
                        method permitted him to create individuated copies efficiently without
                        having to become a slave laborer in his own mills of reproduction. Viscomi
                        may have exaggerated the efficiencies achieved by systematic production
                        while downplaying some of the ways in which Blake worked unsystematically
                        and inefficiently, but once again Phillips’ account of the printing
                        process goes far overboard in the other direction, and again he sometimes
                        has Blake acting in ways that don’t make much sense.</p>
          <p>Phillips’ description of how Blake wrote, drew, and etched text and
                        design on the plate basically follows Viscomi and Essick, but whereas they
                        were especially interested in the “composition” stage of the
                        process, Phillips glides by it in a few sentences. All three agree that
                        Blake wrote and drew backwards directly on the plate with a quill or brush
                        loaded with an acid-resistant substance, and then etched or engraved further
                        on some plates after initial etching. Phillips does not dwell on the fact
                        that as Blake worked with the resist he could stop and erase errors or make
                        improvements fairly easily (we don’t yet know exactly how easily,
                        since the recipe for the resist itself is still the subject of speculation),
                        so improvising the layout on the copper and freely creating or modifying
                        text or design as Viscomi described would be practical if not inevitable. As
                        part of the campaign against <hi rend="i">Blake and the Idea of the
                            Book</hi>, Phillips emphasizes the existence of some preliminary
                        drawings of elements used in the etched images, but even these are very
                        sketchy designs copied freely to the plates, and hardly prove that Blake
                        never created major images on the copper. The fact is, we have very few
                        sketches of design elements that appear in any illuminated books, and even
                        fewer combining text and design, and those circumstances suggest strongly
                        that Blake usually composed (in Essick’s and Viscomi’s sense)
                        his pages directly on the copper. In spite of Phillips’ arguments, it
                        is also likely that some primary designs for the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>
                        never existed in any material form before Blake drew them in resist upon the
                        plate.</p>
          <p>Although Phillips does not say as much as he could about the process of
                        preparing plates, photographs of beautiful facsimiles of Blake’s
                        relief plates “by Michael Phillips” are sprinkled throughout
                        the book (frontispiece, figs. 33, 34, pls. 30, 31, 32, 35, 65) and were
                        featured prominently in the Tate Britain/Metropolitan Museum Blake shows of
                        2000-2001 (co-curated by Phillips). These are probably accurate replicas,
                        and they are impressive to see, important to show, and inadvertently
                        misleading, because they make it appear that the author has personally
                        mastered Blake’s plate-making techniques. When asked, Phillips freely
                        acknowledges that they were created photographically, using a modern
                        light-sensitive resist to reproduce Blake’s writing and drawing on
                        the plate, then etched in stages, as Blake did. At least two reviewers of
                        this book have supposed that these plates were created using Blakean
                        techniques rather than photographically generated.<ref target="n39" type="note">6</ref><note id="n39">6. Carretta was misled (443), as was the astute John Windle
                            in his online review.</note></p>
          <p>When Phillips turns to inking and printing from relief plates, he again
                        pointedly emphasizes how hard and how long Blake must have worked, as if
                        Essick and Viscomi had represented Blake churning out prints effortlessly or
                        carelessly. Phillips makes much of an 1839 account by John Jackson (not the
                        color printer John Baptist Jackson), who says that Blake spent longer wiping
                        the ink off his plates after inking than he did inking them (20). But even
                        if we accept this belated report at face value, the amount of time for the
                        whole inking process would have been brief: if Blake was adept at
                        manipulating the printer’s ball<ref target="n40" type="note">7</ref>
                        that he probably used to ink his plates, basic inking (exclusive of loading
                        the ink on the ball) might have taken at most five to ten seconds per plate,
                        so if he spent twice or three times that much time wiping the border of the
                        plate and removing an occasional spot of ink from the etched areas, the
                        total time spent on inking would still be measured in seconds rather than
                        minutes, and probably didn’t require removing the plate from the bed
                        of the press. Unlike Phillips, I believe that Blake usually <hi rend="i">didn’t</hi> foul the etched “whites” when inking,
                        or if a plate did get fouled occasionally it would usually happen in the
                        middle of a large open area where wiping would be almost as easy as cleaning
                        the border. We need not assume, as Phillips seems to, that every inking was
                        followed by several minutes of tedious wiping (and perhaps reinking) before
                        Blake could take a clean impression. I am not a skilled printmaker, but I
                        can’t imagine any self-respecting artisan who would work that
                        way—usually, one strives to do things right the first time, operating
                        briskly with care and grace, rather than blundering through and then
                        laboriously cleaning up the mess. When we see an illuminated page printed
                        pristinely, with no residual ink smudges in the white areas, we are probably
                        seeing an impression from a plate that was inked carefully and efficiently
                        in a few seconds, without any fouling at all, and wiped only on the border
                        edge (if the edge was wiped, as it often was not in Blake’s later
                        practice). The entire printing process for ordinary relief printing could
                        have averaged as little as one or at most two minutes per impression. That
                        is more time than it would take a commercial printer to print a simple
                        relief woodcut of the same size, but such a rate hardly
                        “belies” (Phillips’word) Viscomi’s estimate that
                        Blake and his wife could in theory have done the printing for all the first
                        copies of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (700 pages) in a single week,
                        especially if they printed two separate leaves at a time.<ref target="n41" type="note">8</ref><note id="n40">7. Or a dabber, used in intaglio printing, as Viscomi
                            proposes.</note><note id="n41">8. See Phillips 21, where Viscomi’s week shrinks to
                            “a few days.” In fact, even printing a single page at a
                            time at the two-minute rate, it would have been possible to complete the
                            whole job in three eight-hour days of continuous work—“a
                            few days” by any standard. Phillips also challenges the idea that
                                <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> was printed in “conjunct
                            pairs,” which as far as I know nobody has proposed, rather than
                            pairs of separate leaves, which Viscomi does mention as a possibility in
                            discussing how efficient the process could have been; there was probably
                            room in Blake’s press to print two separate leaves side by side,
                            and conjunct pairs were certainly used, for instance, in printing <hi rend="i">MHH</hi>; see Viscomi 107, 250.</note></p>
          <pb id="p36-70" n="70"/>
          <p>For the first copies of <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi>, which were
                        printed in color as well as washed with watercolors, Phillips insists upon a
                        printing process that is both cumbersome and extremely improbable. In their
                        earlier writings (and in their recent refutation of the two-pull theory
                        promoted in this book<ref target="n42" type="note">9</ref>) Essick and
                        Viscomi argue that for most color printing, Blake applied a variety of thick
                        color pigments to some areas of the relief plates in addition to his usual
                        printing ink and printed from the etched and unetched surfaces of the
                        shallow plate at once. He could then replenish the ink and/or colors as
                        needed and print again, often without cleaning or even removing the plate
                        from the press. The process would have taken only a little longer than
                        relief printing in monochrome—if that took a minute or two per page,
                        the most careful color printing might take twice or at most three times as
                        long, depending on the amount of color involved. If two or more impressions
                        were taken from each inking and pages were printed in pairs (both probable
                        if not inevitable), the per-page rate would have been much faster than that.
                        I think it is likely that runs from a given plate between cleanings would
                        typically be shorter than in monochrome printing, since the plate would get
                        messy fairly quickly, but he could still take several impressions in
                        succession before stopping to clean accumulated ink and colors from the
                        plate, a tedious process. In contrast, Phillips supposes that Blake must
                        always have color-printed the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> plates in two stages,
                        once in monochrome and once in colors, working one leaf at a time, and <hi rend="i">twice</hi> cleaning the plate completely <hi rend="i">for every
                            single impression.</hi> With the exception of the obviously
                        double-printed “Nurses Song” of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>
                        Copy E, the isolated, slender and ambiguous evidence that Phillips produces
                        as evidence of universal two-stage color printing—occasional
                        suggestions of overprinting and isolated “registration”
                            Pinholes<ref target="n43" type="note">10</ref>—are much better
                        explained as accidents in one-stage printing or the consequence of
                        subsequent hand-coloring. We would need much more and much clearer evidence
                        before we could conclude that Blake always or often or ever worked in this
                        extremely inefficient way. <note id="n42">9. Essick and Viscomi, “An
                            Inquiry”; I have drastically shortened this review, originally
                            written before I saw their piece, so as not to repeat their
                            arguments.</note><note id="n43">10. These “pinholes” do not exist (as Phillips
                            now acknowledges), and wouldn’t mean very much if they did. See
                            Essick and Viscomi “An Inquiry” 88-90 and
                            “Blake’s Method” and Phillips’ response (and
                            Martin Butlin’s) in this issue. I do not believe that Phillips or
                            Butlin have effectively answered any of Essick’s and
                            Viscomi’s objections to the two-pull theory.</note></p>
          <p>Nevertheless, before we can resolve these disputes decisively, several more
                        rounds of careful experiments with Blakean media are due—someone will
                        have to show that it is possible to make Blake-like plates from scratch
                        (with something like his lettering) and print truly Blake-like impressions
                        in color from them efficiently. Though Viscomi’s experimental plates
                        and the prints from them are very good<ref target="n44" type="note">11</ref>
                        and strongly indicate that he is on the right track, I hope we can
                        eventually get even closer to Blake’s methods. The stakes in the
                        debate about printing are significant, for these technical questions affect
                        virtually every aspect of Blake studies. We can’t, for instance, edit
                        illuminated books authoritatively without understanding how he made them,
                        and we can’t read them well without good texts. We will better
                        understand the books when we know more about their projected audience, and,
                        as Phillips cogently argues, understanding the ergonomics and economics of
                        publishing illuminated books is essential to understanding his concept of
                        audience (and to Blake’s biography, dating and establishing the
                        illuminated canon, restoring and preserving Blake’s art, and much
                        more). <note id="n44">11. See <hi rend="i">Blake and the Idea of the

          <p>Some of the new information about Blake’s methods and media that
                        Phillips has uncovered is both sound and important, especially the dramatic
                        evidence of lead white and its deterioration in some copies of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> and his reports of other new physical and chemical
                        analyses conducted by several other researchers. The description of
                        Blake’s watercolor palette, with nicely reproduced samples, is likely
                        to be a useful resource for anyone studying Blake works that include
                        watercolor. Also compelling are Phillips’ explanations of the ways in
                        which the technical aspects of Blake’s procedures intricately relate
                        to contemporary historical and political circumstances and the metaphors and
                        images in his poems and designs. All in all, this book represents a
                        significant, albeit significantly flawed, contribution to our understanding
                        of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> and the processes that went into
                        them.</p>

            <p>In 1995 G. E. Bentley, Jr., accepted Phillips’ copy of the 1732

                            a probable “Blake Book,” adding it to the carefully tended

                            Britain/Metropolitan Museum Blake shows, the reproduction of the bottom
                            of two pages in <hi rend="i">The Creation of the</hi> Songs is the first
                            public appearance of this annotated Milton. Only one of the two
                            annotated openings is actually reproduced, and the same pages were
                            displayed in the London and New York exhibitions. The encircled, <pb id="p36-71" n="71"/> slightly botched, monogram “WB”
                            that appears there (Phillips 56-57, fig. 25) does indeed closely
                            resemble the very distinctive one with which Blake sometimes signed his
                            art. But this monogram is easily imitated, and I don’t think
                            Blake ever used it to sign a text—only visual art. Further, the
                            rest of the lengthy annotation is definitely not in Blake’s hand
                            and its sentiments are at odds with his usual opinions, so the monogram
                            must be either a forgery or an improbable coincidence, the work of some
                            other “WB.”<ref target="n45" type="note">12</ref><note id="n45">12. Probably not the lawyer William Blake, whose hand is
                                quite different. See Bentley, “William Blake and His
                                Circle” 177, and Phillips, “William Blake and the
                                Sophocles Manuscript Notebook” 64.</note></p>
            <p>The annotation’s tone and content are not Blakean. It begins
                            sarcastically: “I cannot enough admire the hardiness of Bentley,
                            who would expunge these two last Lines, as proper and surely as
                            beautiful as any in the whole Poem, and substitute cold expressions
                            foreign to the Author’s [Judgement <hi rend="i">del.</hi>]
                            probable and natural meaning . . .” (56). Blake undoubtedly would
                            have rejected Richard Bentley’s editorial intervention if he were
                            ever aware of it. But I don’t expect to find Blake making an
                            argument in which an appeal to what is “probable and
                            natural” trumps all, and the icy contempt in the
                            annotator’s use of “hardiness” (i.e., audacity) is
                            hardly consistent with Blake’s thoughts about inspiration (or his
                            vocabulary elsewhere).</p>
            <p>But the handwriting in the body of the annotation is the most powerful
                            evidence that the annotator was not Blake. It shares some features with
                            some of Blake’s many hands, as does almost any eighteenth century
                            roundhand. Blake occasionally used a very formal
                            “copperplate” roundhand (as in the original title page of
                                <hi rend="i">Vala</hi>), modulating into a variety of more or less
                            informal hands that incorporate some of its characteristics—if it
                            were Blake’s, this handwriting would be one of the more formal
                            ones. But this hand is much too tight (the bead-like minuscules,
                            particularly), too metronomically rhythmic, and too consistent in its
                            extreme rightward tilt to be like any of Blake’s that I can
                            remember seeing anywhere. Further, a damning cluster of improbabilities
                            quickly becomes evident when one examines particular letterforms and
                            common ligatures or quasi-ligatures. For example, in every one of
                            Blake’s hands from every period, in all but one instance<ref target="n46" type="note">13</ref> of the letters “ld”
                            at the end of a word that I have found featuring a retrograde
                            (uncial-style) “d,” it crosses or is too short to reach
                            the ascender of the “l,” but the annotator’s
                            similar retrograde “d,” occurring twice in the words
                            “would” and “cold,” loops carefully up, over
                            and around the “l” that precedes it. Further, the
                            annotator always used the same retrograde “d” in all
                            positions, whereas Blake almost always used an upright “d”
                            in initial positions, often used it medially (and if medial and
                            retrograde it usually swoops forward again), and he sometimes used it in
                            final position—Blake’s most formal hand in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> features an upright “d” in all
                            three positions, though there are a few retrograde examples in final
                            position. <note id="n46">13. The solitary exception I have ever found is
                                in the word “should” five lines up from the bottom of
                                page f9r of <hi rend="i">An Island</hi>; see Phillips’
                                edition, facing page 60; the same brief passage, however, contains
                                four ligatures in the usual form as well as many examples of the
                                usual up-right initial “d.”</note></p>
            <p>Similarly, Blake rarely used the formal roundhand version of a Roman
                            majuscule “A,” almost always preferring a capital that
                            looks like a large version of the minuscule “a,” and when
                            he did use the Roman-style “A” it invariably has a strong
                            horizontal crossbar; the annotator’s “A” has an
                            elaborate curved crossbar, so obviously practiced that it must have been
                            part of his usual “A.” And so on.<ref target="n47" type="note">14</ref> Given all these uncharacteristic features of
                            the annotator’s hand, I see no reason to believe that the poet
                            William Blake had anything to do with this book. <note id="n47">14.
                                Bentley reviews some other features of Blake’s hands in the
                                course of refuting another mistaken Phillips attribution. See
                                “William Blake and the Sophocles Enigma.” The
                                “Sophocles” manuscript features several un-Blakean
                                hands, none of them anything like the one used in the Milton
                                annotation.</note></p>
