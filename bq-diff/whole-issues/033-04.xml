          <p>The lackluster market of 1998 gave way to a more exciting year of discoveries in the 1999 marketplace. The first newsworthy artifact emerged in January. For many years, there have been only six traced complete copies of the 1802 <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads</hi>, authored by William Hayley and illustrated with 14 plates designed and engraved by Blake. A fugitive copy, first recorded in the Gosford auction catalogue of 1884 and last described in a Rosenbach catalogue of late 1944, turned up in an American private collection in December 1998. The anonymous owner placed the book on consignment with Ursus Books of New York. After complex negotiations undertaken on my behalf by John Windle, the San Francisco book dealer who specializes in Blake and his circle, I acquired the volume late in January 1999. See Appendix 2 for a listing of the seven complete copies of the 1802 <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> I have been able to trace—plus one tantalizing copy still untraced.</p>
          <p>Windle continues to be the world’s major dealer in all things Blakean. In March, he acquired a large number of Blake prints from at least four sources. Most are book illustrations detached from their volumes, but the group includes “The Man Sweeping the Interpreter’s Parlour.” He continued to acquire books throughout the summer and early fall and placed on his website (www.johnwindle.com) an online catalogue, offering 237 lots (some with multiple copies), in late November. This catalogue 31 will be published in printed form early in 2000. All materials in the online catalogue relevant to this sales review are listed below. Windle intends to issue catalogues devoted exclusively to Blake and his circle at intervals of about 18 months.</p>
          <p>In the last sales review (<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 32 [1999]: 93), I mentioned the death of Betsey Cushing Whitney, March 1998, her ownership of an impression of <hi rend="i">The Good and Evil Angels Struggling for Possession of a Child</hi> (Butlin #324), and the possibility of discovering in her collection <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> copy N and <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> copy E. The executors of Mrs. Whitney’s estate have decided not to sell <hi rend="i">The Good and Evil Angels</hi> in the foreseeable future. A thorough search of her library failed to find <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>, but <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> did turn up, was found to contain only 24 pls., and was offered at auction by Sotheby’s New York on 23 April (see illus. A-G at the end of this sales review). Readers of this journal have already learned much about this sale from Elizabeth B. Bentley’s “Urizen in New York City,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 33 (1999): 27-30. I hope that what follows will supplement her lively account.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> copy E, not seen by scholars for many decades, attracted a large cohort of Blakeans (including E. B. Bentley, G. E. Bentley, Jr., Morris Eaves, Joseph Viscomi, John Windle, and your reporter) to view the volume on the day before the sale. We were all motivated by the fear that this would be our only opportunity to study a copy of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> soon to disappear into an anonymous private collection. The party reassembled the next day to witness what we hoped would be a spirited contest between two or more angels (devils?) struggling for possession of a treasure. We were not disappointed. Six bidders soon raced through the low estimate of $500,000; four stayed the course as the bidding passed $1 million. Two dropped out in the neighborhood of $1.5 million. The battle between the remaining contenders, both delivering their bids via telephone, was swift; neither flinched until one suddenly dropped out when the other had the winning bid at $2.3 million. With the buyer’s premium added, the total came to $2,532,500. This was of course a record for a work by Blake, surpassing the $1.32 million the same collector paid in 1989 for <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> copy D. I believe that the <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> sale also established the second highest price ever achieved at auction for a printed book in English, exceeded only by the £4.6 million paid by J. Paul Getty, Jr., in 1998 for Caxton’s c. 1476 edition of <hi rend="i">The Canterbury Tales.</hi> The purchaser of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> was the American private collector who, over the last 20 years, has created an outstanding collection of Blake’s illuminated books, including copies of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence, The Book of Thel, America, Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> I have not been able to determine the identity of the “underbidder” (the person with the bid immediately prior to the winning bid), but imagine what it must be like to bid $2.2 million for a book of 24 pages and not get it.</p>
          <p>The day before the sale, the assembled Blakeans joined forces and spent some two hours going through the Whitney <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi>, thanks to Kimball E. Higgs, Assistant Vice President of Sotheby’s Book Department. Joe Viscomi acted as unofficial ringmaster of the show, explaining, as only he can, the minute particulars of color printing. The sequence of plates is unique: 1, 3, 5, 9, 2, 6, 14, 7, 10, 8, 11, 22, 13, 15, 18, 17, 19, 12, 20, 21, 23, 26-28 (Bentley numbers, used throughout this discussion). Thus, the rediscovery of copy E does not change the fact that no two copies of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> have the same plates in the same order. The mobility of full-page illustrations is hardly surprising; the placement or absence of text plates needs more consideration.</p>
          <p>Rather than beginning with the title page and “Preludium” (pl. 2), as in all other copies, copy E opens with the title page followed by pl. 3, headed “Chap: I” at the top of its left column of text and “Chap: II” half-way down the right column. As in copies D, F, G, and J (H and I are fragments), the absence of pl. 4, a continuation of chapter II and the beginning of chapter III, creates a textual juncture between the first line of chapter II verse 3 on pl. 3 (“Shrill the trumpet: &amp;
<pb id="p33-101" n="101"/>
myriads of Eternity,”) and what, in copies A-C, is the sixth line of chapter III verse 2 on pl. 5 (“In living creations appear’d”). Verse 3 of chapter II thereby assembled reads as follows:
<q>
3. Shrill the trumpet: &amp; myriads of Eternity,<lb/>
In living creations appear’d<lb/>
In the flames of eternal fury.
</q></p>
          <p>With pl. 4 in place, “seven deadly sins of the soul” appear in “living creations”; but it makes equal sense (within a work questioning “sense” in several senses) to embody the “myriads of Eternity.” This rearrangement, well within the range of (dis) junctions and (dis) continuities established elsewhere in the poem, accords with the disruptions of spatio-temporal assumptions central to the thematics, and enacted by the various structures, of <hi rend="i">Urizen.</hi></p>
          <p>After the full-page design on pl. 9 (illus. C), the text of chapter II on pls. 5 (illus. B) and 6 is interrupted by the “Preludium” of pl. 2. While the absence of pl. 4 gains authority because of its absence in five other copies, the placement of the “Preludium” is unique and difficult to attribute to Blake. Yet, this would not be the first time that an English author displaced what is usually thought of as prefatory material to a position later in a book—consider Laurence Sterne’s publication of his “Author’s Preface” in the midst of the third volume of <hi rend="i">Tristram Shandy.</hi></p>
          <p>The positioning of pl. 10 between pls. 7 and 8 is also unique to copy E. Both pls. 8 and 10 bear the chapter heading “IV” and begin with verse “1,” a repetition etched into those respective plates. This, coupled with the absent chapter III heading on excluded pl. 4, offered the opportunity to change one or the other “IV” to “III”—which is exactly what we find on pl. 10. That this revision on the impression in copy E was executed by Blake is strongly suggested by the careful over-writing of the roman numeral to change “IV” to “III” in the same color as the printing ink used for pl. 10, possibly even in the same ink applied with a stylus or pointed brush. Blake had an option here, for it would have taken no more work to convert the chapter heading of pl. 8 to “III” than the conversion of the heading on pl. 10 he chose to execute. He selected the alternative sequence (7, 8, 10, ignoring pl. 9 since it is a full-page design) in all other copies containing all three of these pls. (J lacks pl. 8, and thus has the same leap from 7 to 10 found in E). But the sequence in copy E (7, 10, 8) works equally well as the “normal” arrangement (7, 8, 10) in terms of textual continuities. We end in copy E with the lengthened chapter II—“Till Los rouze’d his fires, affrighted/At the formless unmeasurable death”—and begin with the newly-indicated chapter III: “Ages on ages roll’d over him!” In the normal sequence the “him” is Urizen (since pl. 8 ends with “And these were the changes of Urizen”); here the “him” is either Los or the “formless unmeasurable death”—arguably Urizen once again. These alternative collations and their consequent shifts in pronoun reference strengthen critical perspectives emphasizing the conjunctions (even interminglings) between Urizen and Los rather than their opposition.</p>
          <p>The ending, unique to copy E, of the newly assembled chapter III (“And a first Age passed over,/And a state of dismal woe.” on pl. 10) leads to the beginning of chapter IV (“Los smitten with astonishment/Frightend at the hurtling bones” on pl. 8). The final lines on pl. 8 verse 6 of chapter IV (“And these were the changes of Urizen”) carries us on to the conveniently numbered verse 7 on pl. 11 (“From the caverns of his jointed Spine”) as the first of Urizen’s “changes.” This rearrangement hardly transgresses any standard of continuity established by other copies of the poem.</p>
          <p>The absence of pl. 25, present in all other copies, concludes the anomalies. Pl. 23, ending with the first line of chapter VIII verse 5, moves textually to pl. 28, beginning with a chapter “IX” heading but also signaling that this is not the first plate of the chapter: the text on pl. 28 begins with three lines that conclude verse 4 from pl. 25, with a verse numbered “5” following. Even without comparison to another copy, the verse numbering indicates that copy E lacks the first three verses, and at least one line of the fourth verse, at the beginning of chapter IX. The verbal (as distinct from numerical) disruption is less noticeable, with “For he saw that life liv’d upon death” (arguably a complete sentence, or at least an independent clause with some sense of conclusion) followed by “They lived a period of years/Then left a noisom body/To the jaws of devouring darkness.” With pl. 25 in place, “They” refers to “the Inhabitants of those Cities” in the first line of chapter IX; in copy E, the pronoun finds its most probable referent in the “sons &amp; daughters” of Urizen, line 24 on pl. 23. Since these “sons” reappear in verse 7 on pl. 28 in a context suggesting that they are the urban inhabitants mentioned suggesting on pl. 25, the shift in pronoun reference occasioned by the absence of pl. 25 appears to have little consequence. Mix and match as you please in a textual universe that encourages free play because, like eternity before Urizen’s self-separation, it lacks differentiation. Or should my simile refer to the chaos his fall creates and which he, Los, and Blake’s readers try to organize?</p>
          <p>The most significant design variant appears in pl. 9. In the copy E impression (illus. C), the shape to the right of, and presumably slightly behind, the human figure looks like a grazing horse, complete with an eye and slight indications of a nose. The presence of one of “the beasts of the field” hints that this portrayal of Urizen, bent low to the earth, is indebted to the description of Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel 4:32-33. This same area right of Urizen appears as follows in other copies: A, B, and the separate impression in a private American collection (Butlin #279), a bifurcated, rock-like form; C, head-like, but more triangular than in E, with a slight suggestion of a dark eye(?) and nose or mouth; D, dark rocks; F, triangular rock form, very slightly head-like;
<pb id="p33-102" n="102"/>
G and J, rocks (copies H and I do not contain pl. 9). In copy E, the “eye” and “nose” are created by spots of color printing a bit denser than surrounding passages; there is no evidence of work with brush or pen on the impression to create these features. Thus, the horse-like image may be an accidental product of color printing rather than the result of an intentional act. Such circumstances raise basic issues about accident, agency, and intention in Blake’s illuminated books. Blake chose to employ color printing; at that general level, human will is clearly indicated. But he may have merely allowed the medium to produce the “horse” effect in this instance: after-the-fact acceptance (assuming that he noticed the horse at all) rather than before-the-fact agency. Such circumstances disconcert basic assumptions about the relationship between artifact and artist—as does the work of Jackson Pollock and other “action” artists of the post World War II period. It may be no accident that, during both Blake’s and Pollock’s times, the purposeful incorporation of the accidental within artistic production occurred when the ability to control events seemed far beyond the capabilities of individuals, or even communities. That period in the late eighteenth-century also saw Hume’s questioning of all cause/effect relationships and Kant’s attempts to answer Hume by resituating the metaphysics of causality on epistemological grounds. Blake’s deployment of his media has wide-ranging ideological and philosophical implications when viewed from an interstitial perspective prompted by his own writings on the arts.</p>
          <p>Viscomi’s tour through copy E, visually assisted with transparencies of other copies printed with it in 1794, slowly unveiled some unsettling possibilities. Copy E was printed with copies A, C, D, F, and J; these provide a standard of comparison useful for spotting any unusual features in the Whitney copy. Pl. 1, the title page (illus. A), showed clear evidence of lead-pigment decay, white turning to splotches of black, on the figure’s knees, beard, left side of his face, and the book beneath his feet. The fact that this white-lead decay, also found on several other plates, does not appear in any of the other five copies produced in the 1794 printing is disturbing because of Blake’s production method, per-plate rather than per-volume, with batches of plates printed and colored before collation into individual copies of the book. Even if Blake had used the pigment subject to decay sparingly, and only on one or two impressions of any one plate, the chances of all impressions bearing the lead pigment finding their way into a single copy, rather than being randomly distributed throughout all copies from the same printing, is very slight. The same logic produced the same suspicions when we came upon a tomato-red pigment on pls. 9 (illus. C) and 21 not found in any other copy of the book. Evidence grew that either Blake or someone else had touched up the coloring of copy E after the initial per-plate coloring and after collation.</p>
          <p>Pls. 7 and 21 offered another type of evidence of fiddling. The figures on these plates are densely colored in flesh tones in a way that obscures the underlying articulation of the musculature and any color printing (if present). Pl. 21 also shows dark staining on the verso due to the medium percolating through from the recto—a problem more commonly produced by oil paint than by Blake’s glue- or gum-based colors. While some of the plates in copy E are magnificent, showing all the power and subtlety of Blake’s best color printing and hand coloring, the figure’s face on pl. 7 is a caricature. Although heavily colored, both face and body are flattened, suggesting a colorist unresponsive to the underlying image or the expressiveness of the figure.</p>
          <p>Pl. 21 introduced the final piece of disturbing evidence. Copy E is interleaved with tissue, probably added when the volume was placed in its present binding c. 1841 (see the thorough bibliographic description in the article by G. E. Bentley, Jr., also in this issue). Even if the tissue had been introduced at an earlier date, we can be confident that Blake and his wife Catherine did not include this sort of interleaving in the illuminated books printed in the 1790s. These details are significant because we found that a small piece of the tissue guard had stuck to the upper left surface of pl. 21, leaving behind a hole in the tissue. The medium must have been wet when the tissue was already in place. The spot where the tissue adhered was colored in the questionable red tone.</p>
          <p>The weight of evidence summarized here indicates that <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> copy E may have been touched up by someone other than Blake. I suspect that the motivation for such efforts may not have been to repair damage to the impressions, but rather an attempt to “finish” what, to a Victorian sensibility, may have looked like an unfinished print, with less coloring on the figures than in the background (a style also found, for example, in pl. 7 of copy B). Our inspection at Sotheby’s was hardly definitive, but what we found suggests that further investigations, including chemical analysis of the suspicious pigments, should be undertaken.</p>
          <p>After the spectacular sale of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> copy E, the June auctioning of Blake’s water color, <hi rend="i">Churchyard Spectres Frightening a Schoolboy</hi>, at the bargain(?) price of £26,450 seems almost too trivial to mention. I am told that 6 bidders were still active at £20,000; the estimate was only £5000-7000. See illus. 1 and my disagreements with Christie’s cataloguer (and with Butlin) set forth in the accompanying caption.</p>
          <p>Another June auction brought forth a previously unknown colored copy of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> engravings—see the listing below for basic sales and bibliographic details. This discovery raises once again the many questions surrounding the coloring of the volume. No colored copy of the engravings consistently follows the water colors, even though the publisher, Richard Edwards, owned the colored drawings and could have instructed a colorist, or team of colorists, to base their work on Blake’s originals. Alternatively, did Blake and/or his wife Catherine tint one copy of the engravings as a model for copyists to follow? A definitive answer has yet to emerge, although it would seem an unnecessary expense (at least of the Blakes’ time) to color a set of the
<pb id="p33-103" n="103"/>
engravings when the original water colors were readily at hand. The new copy, now in my collection, was certainly not colored by Blake and offers no new evidence concerning that issue. Setting aside the matter of Blake’s participation, we must next consider the distinction, important for any book with hand-colored illustrations, between the “edition” coloring of multiple copies, executed on behalf of a publisher or bookseller and intended for sale to the public, and “one-off” coloring of a single copy executed by (or on behalf of) its owner. The former may fairly be considered part of the production of the book; the latter is not.</p>
          <p>Edition coloring of the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> is implied, although not explicitly addressed, by the division of recorded copies into “Type I” and “Type II” coloring schemes in John E. Grant, Edward J. Rose, Michael J. Tolley, eds., David V. Erdman, coordinating ed., <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Designs for Edward Young’s</hi> Night Thoughts (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1980) 1:52-72 (hereafter cited as “Grant”). Such a division roughly parallels the distinctly different coloring schemes found in the first edition (1796) and the two later editions (1806, 1813) of J. G. Stedman’s <hi rend="i">Narrative, of a Five Years’ Expedition, Against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</hi>, another book with engravings by Blake (albeit not designed by him) and co-published by James Edwards, brother of the publisher of <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts.</hi> Grant’s basic touchstone for distinguishing the coloring types is the tinting of the giant figure of Death on the first plate, a fly-title to Night the First. Death’s gown is white (i.e., uncolored except for gray shading in folds and shadowed areas) in Type I and green in Type II. Certainly the 19 previously recorded Type I copies are a sufficient number to indicate an edition coloring. Grant records only 4 Type II copies, but even that number suggests edition coloring. Unfortunately, this simple two-type scheme is immediately complicated by a single copy, designated as Type III on the basis of the gray coloring of Death’s gown. Grant (60) rightly suggests that the Type III copy may be one-off, or even a “forgery,” but might it simply be part of the Type I coloring session, the result of the colorist extending gray shading over the entire gown? Careful study of the gray-Death copy could give us an answer, but we should also step back from these details and consider our own analytical procedures. Might the whole approach to the issue, implicit in Grant and in my previous question, be fundamentally flawed? Variations among copies comprising both the Type I and Type II categories (as distinct from the defining differences <hi rend="i">between</hi> the two types) indicate that the colorists did not follow a rigid scheme of where the colors should be placed. In these circumstances, as with Blake’s edition coloring of his illuminated books, a coloring “type” or session must be defined by the palette, based on the assumption that the colorist or colorists did not mix up a new batch of tints for each print, and stylistic features that constitute the “signature” of any artist’s work. (It should also be kept in mind that edition coloring was generally executed on unbound sheets, and thus the unit of production was the individual print, not a collated copy of the book). This palette, or determinable range of finite colors, coupled with the way the tints are applied, are far better indications of edition coloring than the specific color of a singular motif (e.g., Death’s gown) or even of a number of motifs. The basic division between Type I and Type II coloring should also be questioned. Does the distinction register different colorists (or teams of colorists) working at roughly the same time, or (as Grant believes) two coloring sessions at different times? The colored copies of the same plate reproduced by Grant to exemplify the differences between Type I and Type II also show significant similarities. The representative examples of the fly-title to Night the Third even seem to share the same palette.</p>
          <p>The newly discovered copy further enriches an already heady brew. Death’s gown is light brown. None of the other colors of specific motifs, described by Grant (54) for both Type I and Type II copies, is repeated in the new copy. However, as I’ve suggested above, I do not think that the <hi rend="i">placement</hi> of colors is of major significance for defining colorists or coloring sessions. The volume would also appear to be the product of at least three coloring sessions by at least three different colorists. Roughly the first half of the volume is distinguished by vibrant washes in rose-pink, purple, and aquamarine, the last used for the background sky in many plates. The handling of the colors is sensitive to the underlying engraved image. The thin washes do not obscure hatching and crosshatching patterns. As in several Type I copies I have seen, the colorist has underscored these engraved indications of modeling and shadow by coloring them with a slightly darker shade of the color used elsewhere on the motif. This technique is most evident in the treatment of clothing, unclothed bodies, and faces. The fly-title to Night the Third is particularly striking in this respect. The colorist has added a purple gown to the woman; she appears to be partly draped but mostly nude in uncolored copies. The costume is defined through transparent washes and darker, serpentine folds that suggest rapid upward movement. These additions, not indicated by the underlying engraving, lend further drama to the composition.</p>
          <p>There are many parallels in palette and style between the first colorist of the new copy and the Type I copy in the Huntington Library; the two examples of page 19 are almost identical. Given these similarities with the Huntington copy, I would also classify the first coloring style found in the new copy as Type I. Indeed, I am even tempted to claim that the two sets of prints were colored by the same person. The hues accord with colors found in the decorative arts of England as early as the 1770s—see for example many soft-paste porcelain pieces of that period, such a Worcester plate in the Fitzwilliam Museum rather shockingly painted in bright green, pink, and purple. As this comparison implies, I think that the decorative arts, more responsive
<pb id="p33-104" n="104"/>
to fashion than nature, provide a better standard for the approximate dating of the commercial coloring of prints than the “fine” arts of painting and water color.</p>
          <p>The second coloring scheme emerges on page 46 and dominates the second half of the volume. The palette is in a much lower key, with a dull medium blue rather than aquamarine for skies. The colors look faded, although it is difficult to imagine how actual fading from exposure to light could have occurred so evenly on so many pages in a bound book. The application of broad, flat washes shows far less responsiveness to underlying engraved patterns than the first coloring style. Facial details, nicely tinted in the Type I coloring, are rarely touched. There is some use of darker hues to underscore folds in costumes and other shaded areas, but this work is far less noticeable and less successful than what we find in the first coloring style. The second style does not accord with Type II coloring and shows so little character that it is very difficult to date. However, there are sufficient similarities between the tonal range used by this second colorist and the Type I coloring of plates in Night Four (see the Huntington, National Gallery of Victoria, and Muhlenberg College copies) to suggest that he/she/they saw a Type I copy and were influenced by it, or perhaps were instructed to follow its example.</p>
          <p>The third coloring style appears only on pages 63 and 70. Both have the aquamarine skies of the Type I colorist, but the figures have been overpainted in much deeper tones more thickly applied. On page 63, a bit of the heavy purple on the figure’s gown, just inside the lower left margin, has been offset onto the facing page—strong evidence that the book was already bound when the color was applied. This final coloring style, characteristic of the later Victorian period (c. 1880-90?), is almost certainly one-off and not part of any edition coloring. The multiple coloring of this new copy should alert us to the possibility of similar layers in other copies.</p>
          <p>Grant (53) cites Martin Butlin as the authority for dating Type I coloring to “about 1797” and Type II to “about 1805.” It seems reasonable to assume that at least one of the major coloring styles was part of the book’s publication in 1797. The provenances of several Type I copies—e.g., those once owned by Thomas Butts (now in an anonymous collection), Samuel Boddington (now Library of Congress), Sir John Soane (now Soane Museum), Third Earl Spencer (now John Rylands Library) and Rebekah Bliss (sold 1826, now Princeton)—suggest a reasonably early date of coloring, although not necessarily before 1805. Type II is taken as a later style because it is “similar in effect to the coloured copies of Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Triumphs of Temper</hi> (1803, owned by Mr. George Goyder) and <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (1805, owned by the late S. Foster Damon) of about 1805” (Grant 53). But both these volumes provide poor standards of coloring. Each is a one-off copy rather than the product of edition coloring and may have been executed at any time after publication. Further, as Grant points out (92n84), “in fact the character of the colour in the Goyder and Damon pages [meaning “prings”?] is not particularly close to that of Type II <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts.</hi>” The matter is further complicated by W. E. Moss’s conjecture that his Type II copy (now Library of Congress) was first owned by the book’s publisher (see Grant 70), a provenance that strongly suggests a 1797 date of coloring since Edwards went out of business shortly after the publication of <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts.</hi></p>
          <p>A better way of at least guessing at the date of a second coloring session is prompted by the 1833 watermark in the “Explanation” leaf of an uncolored copy sold CL, 7 Dec. 1988, #120. One reasonable explanation for this oddity is that some bookseller had a remainder stock of the 1797 <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> but lacked a sufficient number of “Explanation” leaves and had it reprinted, line for line, in the same typeface. If there was a reissue of the book in 1833 or a bit later, then this would have also been the most logical time for another commercial, “edition” coloring session. The new copy, with its two major coloring styles, hints at the possibility that some of the remainder sheets available c. 1833 had already been colored c. 1797 and that the second, far less elegant tinting style was added, hastily and cheaply, to a sufficient number of uncolored impressions to produce completely colored copies. This theory implies that Type II coloring was not executed c. 1833 but probably at some earlier time, perhaps even in 1797 along with Type I copies. Such a redating is also hinted at by the stylistic similarities between Types I and II and Moss’s conjectural provenance for his Type II copy. But several other scenarios are possible, including a one-off status and a very late date for the second style of coloring in the new copy. Clearly, a great deal more expertise, insight, and hard work needs to be expended on the colored <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> engravings before we are to get this can of worms under control.</p>
          <p>Blake is beginning to appear regularly in the Internet auction market. Most of the material is editions and criticism not covered by this sales review, but original prints have appeared occasionally—see for example Josephus, <hi rend="i">The Wit’s Magazine</hi>, and Flaxman’s Hesiod below. The general level of accuracy in the auction blurbs is abysmal: <hi rend="i">caveat emptor.</hi> My coverage of these online auctions is far from comprehensive.</p>
          <p>Although not on the market, the discovery of an unrecorded impression of Blake’s rare separate print, “Albion rose,” deserves mention here. The print reportedly has some lines by Blake written on the verso. For a bit more information, see under <hi rend="i">The Separate Plates of William Blake</hi> in Appendix 1.</p>
          <p>In my 1998 sales review, I speculated that David Thompson recently purchased several works by Blake, including his <hi rend="i">Pilgrim’s Progress</hi> water colors and the Larger Blake-Varley Sketchbook. This is completely false; I have no clear evidence
<pb id="p33-105" n="105"/>
that Thompson owns any works by Blake, although rumors persist on the London art market. The Bunyan illustrations and the sketchbook are owned by a British private collector, Alan Parker.</p>
          <p>In 1993, the Scolar Press (London) published a two-volume study and catalogue of <hi rend="i">The Heath Family Engravers 1779-1878</hi>, written by one of their direct descendants, John Heath. The handlist of books containing plates executed by James and Charles Heath was based in part on the collection formed by the author. In July 1999, the Huntington Library received a nicely printed and paper-bound handlist of John Heath’s collection, now grown to about 1400 volumes, and an accompanying letter indicating that the books were available for <hi rend="i">en bloc</hi> purchase. The Huntington declined, but presumably Mr. Heath has offered his collection elsewhere. Many of the books contain illustrations based on Stothard’s designs; a few contain plates engraved by Blake as well as the Heaths. At this time (January 2000), I have no knowledge of a sale.</p>
          <p>The year of all sales and catalogues in the following lists is 1999 unless indicated otherwise. The auction houses add their purchaser’s surcharge to the hammer price in their price lists. These net amounts are given here, following the official price lists. The value-added tax levied against the buyer’s surcharge in Britain is not included. Late 1999 sales will be covered in the 2000 review.

	<figDesc>Pencil, pen, and water color, 17.9 × 11.6 cm. Butlin #342. Sold CL, 8 June 1999, lot 123. Essick collection. The drawing is basically in monochrome gray and black wash; the only coloring presently visible is blue sky in the opening in the clouds where the stars appear, dark blue in the upper left corner, very pale blue on the boy’s breeches and shirt, yellow on his curly hair, a little rose on the face of the female spectre pursuing him, and a thin strip of blue along the left margin revealed when the old and slightly acidic cover mat was removed. This last bit of coloring, apparently hidden from the destructive effects of light for many years, indicates that the drawing is much faded.<lb/><lb/>
Closely following Butlin’s entry in his great catalogue of Blake’s paintings and drawings, Christie’s anonymous cataloguer argues that this drawing should not be associated with Blake’s designs for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, executed on commission for the engraver and would-be publisher R. H. Cromek in 1805 and published in 1808, because “there is no justification in the text for the figure in the doorway on the right, who looks like a schoolmaster holding a birch, and the boy is holding a doll rather than a satchel.” Further, “the style of the watercolour, which is only half finished, suggests a date in the later 1790s, some five years or more before Blake became actively concerned with illustrating <hi rend="i">The Grave.</hi>” Christie’s cataloguer associates the drawing with the water color <hi rend="i">Malevolence</hi> (Butlin #341), painted in 1799, and points out that “both works, perhaps significantly, finished up in [i.e., were once in] the collection of Mrs. Alexander Gilchrist.” The Christie’s catalogue cites a “letter to M. Butlin” by “Robert Essick” as the source of the notion that the drawing illustrates Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave.</hi> I suspect that this letter is less detailed, and possibly less convincing, than the presentation of the disputed theory in Robert N. Essick and Morton D. Paley, <hi rend="i">Robert Blair’s</hi> The Grave <hi rend="i">Illustrated by William Blake: A Study with Facsimile</hi> (London: Scolar Press, 1982) 74. The rest of this caption expands upon the arguments presented in this book.<lb/><lb/>
Essick and Paley contend that the drawing illustrates the following passage in Blair’s poem:
<q>
Oft in the lone church-yard at night I’ve seen,<lb/>
By glimpse of moon-shine, chequ’ring through the trees,<lb/>
The school-boy, with his satchel in his hand,<lb/>
Whistling aloud to bear his courage up,<lb/>
And lightly tripping o’er the long flat stones<lb/>
(With nettles skirted, and with moss o’ergrown)<lb/>
That tell in homely phrase who lie below.<lb/>
Sudden he starts! and hears, or thinks he hears,<lb/>
The sound of something purring at his heels.<lb/>
Full fast he flies, and dares not look behind him,<lb/>
Till out of breath he overtakes his fellows;<lb/>
Who gather round, and wonder at the tale<lb/>
Of horrid apparition, tall and ghastly,<lb/>
That walks at dead of night, or takes his standO’er some<lb/>
new open’d grave; and strange to tell,<lb/>
Evanishes at crowing of the cock!<lb/>
(pp. 3-4 in the 1808 ed.)

The young boy, general setting, gravestones, and time of night (note the stars between clouds upper left) in the drawing match the passage. The doorway to a church or tomb on the right may be a pictorial elaboration of the “new open’d grave” of the poem and accords with the portal imagery so important to Blake’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> illustrations (see Essick and Paley 51). The “something purring” at the boy’s heels—presumably a cat, but taken by the frightened child to be a sinister spirit—is personified by the female figure behind him. True to the text, the child does not “look behind” at his pursuer. The absence of an explicit textual basis for the tall, bearded figure is not sufficient reason for disassociating the design from <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>: 7 of the 12 designs engraved and published contain prominent figures not specifically warranted by the poem. Yet, a justification for the tall, bearded man on the far right does emerge by making a distinction between the “something purring” the boy hears in the churchyard and the “tall and ghastly” apparition he later describes to his schoolmates. Indeed, the actions of the former tend to distinguish it from the imagined size of the latter, and the differences between the two accord with the tendency to embellish frightening incidents upon their telling. If, as Butlin and the Christie’s catalogue claim, the figure in the doorway “looks like a schoolmaster holding a birch,” it is hard to conceive of an embodied projection of a schoolboy’s fears more appropriate for Blair’s passage. The robed figure “takes his stand” before “some new open’d grave” and points an accusatory finger in the boy’s direction while holding, in his other hand, the feared instrument of punishment. Both cat and schoolmaster become apparitions for the child and illustrative opportunities for the artist.<lb/><lb/>
To my eyes, the object the child holds looks more like Blair’s “satchel” than a doll. Why would a male child of school age be carrying a doll? The scenario seems improbable on the face of it (think of the teasing he would receive from his classmates). If we assume that the (female?) doll’s feet are covered by a skirt, just left of the boy’s left leg, it is difficult to explain away the tassel on the object’s lower left corner. I have never seen a picture of a late eighteenth- or early nineteenth-century skirt or dress with a trailing tassel (think of the dirt it would collect). The upper reaches of the doll/satchel are unfinished, but this area just below the boy’s head looks less like the head of a doll than a sketchy rendering of the boy’s left hand clutching the top of the satchel. Under magnification, the passage reveals a few pencil lines probably indicating fingers; similar pencil lines suggest the equally unfinished right hand of the schoolmaster. If <hi rend="i">Churchyard Spectres</hi> is not based on <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, it is one of the more extraordinary coincidences in art.<lb/><lb/>
The churchyard scene was illustrated in at least three editions of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> published before 1805. In an ed. of 1785 the editor, G. Wright, comments that “the above description [of the schoolboy] has met with universal approbation, and is doubtless one of the most natural and pleasing <hi rend="i">pictures</hi> [emphasis mine] throughout the whole poem” (quoted in Essick and Paley 74). If Wright’s comment represents a consensus view, 
                                    <pb id="p33-108" n="108"/>
                                    then it would seem probable that Cromek, whose eyes were always firmly fixed on the marketplace, would require his illustrator to attempt a visual rendition of the famous scene. No illustration of the passage is named in Cromek’s first prospectus of 1805, listing 15 designs (only 12 were published), but we know from John Flaxman’s letter of 18 Oct. 1805 to William Hayley that Blake was preparing “a set of 40 drawings” for <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> (BR 166). It was conventional for an illustrator to execute a large group of preliminary drawings from which the much smaller group of those engraved and published would be selected—witness Blake’s 156 water colors for the first 4 “Nights” of Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, of which 43 were engraved. In his letter to Hayley, Flaxman refers to several specific designs, including <hi rend="i">The Gambols of the Ghosts According with Their Affections Previous to the Final Judgment</hi> (included by Butlin among the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> designs, #636). <hi rend="i">Gambols</hi> was neither listed in the first prospectus nor published, and thus the absence of <hi rend="i">Churchyard Spectres</hi> from these documents cannot in itself be a reason for excluding the drawing from the group illustrating Blair’s poem.<lb/><lb/>
At 17.9 × 11.6 cm., <hi rend="i">Churchyard Spectres</hi> is a bit smaller than the published <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> illustrations (among those with a vertical format, pl. 2 is the shortest at 23.1 cm., pl. 9 the narrowest at 12 cm.). But the drawing was probably once somewhat larger; the incomplete spires at the top and the way the man’s arm is cut into on the right margin suggest cropping. <hi rend="i">Death Pursuing the Soul through the Avenues of Life</hi> (listed in the first prospectus and included by Butlin among the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> designs, #635) was similarly cropped top, right, and perhaps bottom to 24.7 × 11.4 cm. The medium and degree of finish exhibited by <hi rend="i">Churchyard Spectres</hi> fits comfortably within the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> cluster, one that ranges from pencil sketches with touches of wash (<hi rend="i">Gambols</hi>) to highly finished monochrome wash drawings (<hi rend="i">Death Pursuing</hi>) to partly colored drawings (<hi rend="i">The Widow Embracing Her Husband’s Grave</hi>, Butlin #633). The stylistic spectrum is also broad, including the pathetic-picturesque (<hi rend="i">Widow Embracing</hi>) as well as the horrific-sublime (<hi rend="i">Death Pursuing</hi> and “Death of the Strong Wicked Man,” pl. 5 among the published engravings).<lb/><lb/>
Butlin’s dating of <hi rend="i">Churchyard Spectres</hi> on stylistic grounds to “c. 1795-1800,” and thus to a period at least 5 years before the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> project, shows his usual sensitivity to the nuances of pen and brush; but this approach to dating is generally a little shaky when such a narrow time-frame is at issue, and particularly so when not supported by other lines of reasoning or documentation. A broad, caricature-like style, similar to some of Blake’s water colors of c. 1797-98 illustrating Thomas Gray’s poems (see particularly Butlin #335.31), could have been prompted by the seriocomic tone of Blair’s passage. <hi rend="i">Gambols of the Ghosts</hi> also includes, lower left, some caricature figures; much of the composition has a lighthearted tenor in accord with Blair’s reference to the “merriment” of “lightheel’d ghosts” in the passage illustrated (p. 2 in the 1808 ed.). Style can be shaped by the nature of the text illustrated as much as by chronological shifts in an artist’s handling of his materials. In this instance, I believe that Blake returned to a style he had used a few years earlier because of its appropriateness for the passage he was picturing.<lb/><lb/>
Finally, there is the matter of provenance. I suspect that the fact that both <hi rend="i">Churchyard Spectres</hi> and <hi rend="i">Malevolence</hi> were once in Mrs. Gilchrist’s collection argues for Butlin’s view no more than the fact that she owned 3 undisputed <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> drawings (Butlin #615, 620, 638) argues for mine.</figDesc>

            <p>A note on bindings and issues: <hi rend="i">The Wit’s Magazine</hi> was originally issued in monthly parts, stitched in printed wrappers, from Jan. 1784 through May 1785. There would be no reason for a purchaser of the monthly numbers to bind them together in paper-covered boards, as in the copy above, and print a spine label, since such a binding was used only as a cheap, temporary covering by booksellers-publishers. Thus I suspect that remainder copies of the magazine were bound into single vols., in boards, for sale as such by its publisher, Harrison and Co., after monthly publication had ceased. This practice would also explain why one encounters complete, one-vol. copies of all issues far more frequently than the individual monthly issues.</p>

I believe that Sir Geoffrey made this suggestion on the basis of similarities between the figure in this print and the three men in <hi rend="i">Stothard and Friends Prisoners during a Boating Excursion at Upnor Castle on the Medway</hi>, an etching of c. 1781 so titled and attributed to Stothard in Mrs. A. E. Bray, <hi rend="i">Life of Thomas Stothard</hi> (London: John Murray, 1851) 20-21. For an illus. and the most recent scholarship on this print, see G. E. Bentley, Jr., “Blake’s First Arrest, at Upnor Castle,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 31 (1997/98): 82-84. One of the men in the Medway scene may be Blake; Keynes “guess[es]” that the background figure, third from the left, might be Blake in his <hi rend="i">Complete Portraiture of William &amp; Catherine Blake</hi> (London: Trianon P for the Blake Trust, 1977) 118. I find it impossible to identify the figure in Cumberland’s rondel as Blake or anyone else, but the comparison between the two prints opens up several intriguing possibilities. They are etched in a remarkably similar style; even the posture and composition of the figures is similar. If it were not for the attributions to different artists, I would say the prints are by the same hand. Might Cumberland have had something to do with the production of the Stothard print? The two men were good friends in the early 1780s. In 1779 they went together on a sailing expedition up the Medway and took another excursion on an unidentified river in 1781—see Shelley M. Bennett, <hi rend="i">Thomas Stothard: The Mechanisms of Art Patronage in England circa 1800</hi> (Columbia: Univ. of Missouri P, 1988) 11. The etching style of both prints strongly resembles others by Cumberland; I can find no other etchings by Stothard dating from the early 1780s in this or any other style. One must of course allow for the possibility that the professional artist, Stothard, greatly influenced the work of the amateur, Cumberland.</figDesc></figure><pb id="p33-116" n="116"/>

C.”; small aquatint of a structure, entitled on the facing verso by George Jr., “Saxon Monument at Lord Holland’s near Ramsgate.” Geoffrey Keynes ascribes the composition of the etched poem to Blake in “‘To the Nightingale’: Perhaps an Unrecognized Poem by William Blake,” <hi rend="i">Book Collector</hi> 30 (1981): 335-45, but this attribution has not been generally accepted. 3 similar albums of Cumberland’s prints have been recorded, 1 in the Bristol City Art Gallery (14 etchings) and 2 in the Keynes Collection, Fitzwilliam Museum (14 and 26 etchings).

                <figDesc><hi rend="i">Profile Portrait of Frederick Tatham, with Other Studies.</hi> Pen and brown ink, 10.2 × 8.9 cm., inscribed in brown ink, “March - 1829 - Paris,” and in pencil, “a recollection of Fredk. Tatham.” Probably clipped from a sketchbook, the pencil inscription added by Richmond at a much later date than the drawing (as with many other examples of pen drawings from his early sketchbooks). Essick collection. Richmond lived in Calais and Paris between August 1828 and May 1829. Both Richmond and Tatham (1805-78) were among the young artists who gathered around Blake in the final years of his life. After William Blake’s death, Mrs. Blake lived with Tatham, who inherited the remaining stock of Blake’s work (including the copperplates of the illuminated books) after Mrs. Blake’s death. I can find no record of Tatham’s presence in Paris in March 1829. Richmond probably annotated his drawing with the word “recollection” because it is not a portrait from the life. This is the only contemporary portrait of Tatham known to me. A small portrait of Tatham, looking nothing like this drawing, appears in <hi rend="i">Blake and the Youthful Ancients: Being Portraits of William Blake and His Followers Engraved on Wood by Leonard Baskin and with a Biographical Notice by Bennett Schiff</hi> (Northampton: Gehenna Press, 1956).

              <p>Enfield, <hi rend="i">Exercises in Elocution</hi>, 1780. BBA, 10 June, #89, with Enfield, <hi rend="i">The Speaker</hi>, 1781, both in later calf (Barrie Marks, £322). The 4 unsigned pls. in <hi rend="i">Exercises</hi>, dated 1782 in their imprints, are individually attributed to Stothard in A. C. Coxhead, <hi rend="i">Thomas Stothard, R.A.</hi> (London: Bullen, 1906) 169. Coxhead, however, does not record the book for which they were executed (facing-page numbers on the pls. coordinate text and illustration; thus, we can be certain that the pls. are indeed for the <hi rend="i">Exercises</hi> and not later additions). Coxhead does not indicate his reasons for the attribution, but I suspect that the pls., removed from the vol., are in the Balmanno Collection in the British Museum, Coxhead’s chief resource for his work on Stothard. Stylistic features also link the pls. to Stothard. <hi rend="i">The Speaker</hi> contains 2 pls. after Stothard, 1 engraved by Blake (see above under books with engravings by and after Blake).</p>

The verso inscription refers to “Baker’s Practice,” the half title of the book. Provenance: inherited c. 1995 by the present owner from his uncle, an avid hunter.

            </head>
            <p><hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads, Written by William Hayley . . . Drawn, Engraved, and Published, by William Blake</hi> (Chichester, 1802) is one of the rarest letterpress books containing plates designed and engraved by Blake. The following census of recorded copies that include all four ballads should be considered only as a preliminary effort. For bibliographic descriptions of the book, see N. J. Barker, “Some Notes on the Bibliography of William Hayley: Part III,” <hi rend="i">Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society</hi> 3 (1962): 340-46; and Roger R. Easson and Robert N.

see Bentley 572 and his <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1995) 221. What is probably the finest copy ever recorded (see H, below) remains untraced. I would much appreciate learning the present location of copy H, or any other pertinent information about it. Remarkably, there is only one traced and complete copy remaining in Britain, while 3 such copies are now within a few miles of each other in Southern California.</p>
            <p>A. CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, Sir Geoffrey Keynes Collection, Cambridge, England. Full crimson morocco gilt by Riviere. Provenance: Acquired by Geoffrey Keynes at an unknown time; bequeathed to the Cambridge University Library, 1984. Listed in Keynes, <hi rend="i">Bibliotheca Bibliographici: A Catalogue of the Library Formed by Geoffrey Keynes</hi> (London: Trianon P, 1964) no. 581.</p>
            <p>B. ROBERT N. ESSICK, Altadena, California. Full green morocco by J. Wright, Frederick Locker-Lampson’s book-plate, designed by Kate Greenaway, pasted to the inside front cover, stamped “JAN 15 1945 KROWL” vertically along the inner margin of p. [i]. Inscribed in pencil by Locker-Lampson on the verso of the front free endpaper: “Sold for £14.14 to a dealer at L<hi rend="s">d</hi>. Gosford’s sale in 1884. Swinburne gave £21 to Pearson for a much inferior copy (as regards size) in calf F L.” Another pencil inscription by Locker-Lampson appears just below: “I have now inserted a Drawing &amp; an Engraving—both by Blake (Eagle &amp; Weather plate) F L.” For Swinburne’s copy, see D, below. Provenance: Archibald Brabazon Sparrow Acheson, 4th Earl of Gosford; sold from his collection, Puttick and Simpson, London, 22 April 1884, #438, in the present binding (£12 to the dealer John Pearson); Locker-Lampson by 1886, as recorded in <hi rend="i">The Rowfant Library: A Catalogue of the Printed Books, Manuscripts, Autograph Letters, Drawings and Pictures, Collected by Frederick Locker-Lampson</hi> (London: Bernard Quaritch, 1886) 139-40; probably E. D. Church, who acquired the Rowfant Library en bloc; possibly Dodd Mead &amp; Co., which dispersed major parts of the Church collection not acquired by Henry Huntington; the dealer A. S. W. Rosenbach, who offered the vol. in his sale cat. [28] of 1936, #44, with an impression of Blake’s pl. 4 (“The Weather-house”) from Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Life of Cowper</hi> (1803-04) and Blake’s preliminary drawing for “The Eagle” (pl. 6 of the <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>), both inserted in this copy by Locker-Lampson according to his undated pencil note quoted above ($975); the inserted works removed and the drawing sold to Lessing J. Rosenwald by 1939 (now Library of Congress—see Butlin #361); Rosenbach cat. [30] of 1939, #39, the volume only without the inserted materials ($85); Rosenbach cat. [35] of 1944, #46, the volume only without the inserted materials ($185); apparently a collector named “Krowl” by Jan. 1945 (see stamp noted above); an anonymous American collector; on consignment with Ursus Books, New York, Jan. 1999; acquired late Jan. 1999 by Essick (John Windle, the San Francisco book dealer, acting as agent). The 2nd and 3rd Rosenbach cats. (above) state that this copy was from the William A. White collection. There are at least three reasons to reject this claim. The 1st Rosenbach cat. (1936) refers to the White copy as though it were distinct from the one offered for sale. Rosenbach’s own records of the White Blake collection, written c. 1927-29, indicate that the White copy was in “wrappers” and housed in a “slip case” (typescript in the Rosenbach Library, Philadelphia), whereas this copy (B) was bound in its present full green morocco without the original wrappers no later than 1884. Finally, copy E (below) is clearly the White copy, for it bears his pencil signature, and there is no evidence that he ever owned more than 1 copy.</p>
            <p>C. THE HUNTINGTON LIBRARY, San Marino, California. Full blue levant morocco, elaborate gilt decorations, art-nouveau style, by Riviere. Original front blue wrappers for Ballads 2-4 bound at the end. Provenance: Frank T. Sabin; Frederick R. Halsey by May 1903; acquired with the Halsey collection by Henry E. Huntington, Dec. 1915. A coded dealer’s note in pencil on the recto of the back free endpaper suggests that the book was placed in its present binding c. 1903.</p>
            <p>D. THE HUNTINGTON LIBRARY, San Marino, California. Full tan calf by Francis Bedford. “Swinburne’s copy” inscribed in pencil on the verso of the front free endpaper. Provenance: Acquired by A. C. Swinburne for £21 from the dealer John Pearson at an unknown time, according to an undated pencil note about this copy by Frederick Locker-Lampson on the verso of the front free endpaper in copy B (see also the inscription in copy F, below); the dealer George D. Smith; acquired at an unknown time by Henry E. Huntington and catalogued by the Huntington Library Oct. 1928.</p>
            <p>E. THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, Lessing J. Rosenwald Collection, Washington, D.C. In parts, original blue wrappers, lacking the general title page, housed in a half green morocco slipcase. Ink signature of “J. Parker” (probably James Parker, Blake’s fellow-apprentice in the 1770s and print-publishing partner in the 1780s) and pencil signature of William A. White dated 30 Dec. 1895, both on the inside front wrapper of the first ballad. Provenance: Parker (died 1805); White by 1895; the dealer A. S. W. Rosenbach c. 1927-29; Lessing J. Rosenwald by 1929, given by him to the Library of Congress in 1943 but retained at his Alverthorpe Gallery, Jenkintown, Pennsylvania; moved to Washington after Rosenwald’s death in 1979. G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1969) 116n1, suggests that this copy may have been one of those distributed by John Flaxman.</p>

            <p>F. PRINCETON UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, Princeton, New Jersey. Full crimson morocco gilt by Riviere, with the book-plates of M. C. D. Borden, Herschel V. Jones, and A. Edward Newton, and a Princeton University Library gift bookplate bearing the name of Grace Lansing Lambert. Inscribed in pencil on the front flyleaf, probably by the dealer John Pearson (see copy D, above), “Perhaps the rarest of Blake’s works. The only other copy we have ever seen we sold to Mr. Swinburne 20 years ago.” Provenance: Pearson; Borden, sold from his collection, The American Art Association, New York, 17 Feb. 1913, #89 ($200 to the dealer George D. Smith, probably acting for Henry E. Huntington); Huntington, sold as a duplicate from his collection, Anderson Galleries, New York, 10 Dec. 1917, #400 ($180); Jones, sold from his library at Anderson Galleries, New York, 2 Dec. 1918, #188 ($370); Newton, sold from his library at Parke-Bernet, New York, 17 April 1941, #140 ($110); Henry S. Borneman, sold from his library at Parke-Bernet, New York, 1 Nov. 1955, #235 ($110); Lambert, who gave the volume to Princeton c. 1960. Mrs. Lambert’s gift of the volume is noted in Charles Ryskamp, “A Blake Collection for Princeton,” <hi rend="i">Princeton University Library Chronicle</hi> 21 (1960): 172-75.</p>
            <p>G. THE WATKINSON LIBRARY, Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut. Full black morocco gilt, dark blue endpapers. Provenance: Given to Trinity College Library by Allan R. Brown in 1940, earlier history not known.</p>
            <p>H. UNTRACED. In parts, original blue wrappers, housed in a green morocco case by 1924 (according to the 1924 and 1937 auction cats., below). Provenance: Acquired by Bernard Buchanan Macgeorge, apparently between 1892 and 1906 (see Macgeorge collection cats. noted below); sold from his collection at Sotheby’s London, 1 July 1924, #120 (£80); W. E. Moss, sold from his collection at Sotheby’s London, 2 March 1937, #222 (£410 to the London dealer Maggs Bros.). Bryan Maggs tells me that his family’s firm has no records concerning this purchase other than symbols written in their copy of the Moss sale cat. which suggest (to his practiced eye) that the book was acquired for stock, perhaps with the hope of selling it to Martin Bodmer, who placed several substantial bids with Maggs for the Moss auction. The Director of the Bibliotheca Bodmeriana in Geneva has informed me that the library has no record of the work. The volume is not listed in the Macgeorge collection cat. of 1892, but it is described in <hi rend="i">Catalogue of the Library of Bernard B. Macgeorge</hi> (Glasgow: James Maclehose and Sons, 1906) 15.</p>

              </title>
            </head>
            <p>This division is organized by individual (say, William Hayley or John Flaxman), with works by and about Blake’s friends and patrons, living individuals with whom he had significant direct and demonstrable contact. It includes Thomas Butts, Thomas Hartley Cromek, George Cumberland, John Flaxman and his family, Henry Fuseli, Thomas and William Hayley, John Linnell and his family, Samuel Palmer, James Parker, George Richmond, Thomas Stothard, and John Varley. It does <hi rend="i">not</hi> include important contemporaries with whom Blake’s contact was negligible or non-existent such as John Constable and William Wordsworth and Edmund Burke; such major figures are dealt with more comprehensively elsewhere, and the light they throw upon Blake is very dim.</p>
            <p>Reviews listed here are only for books which are substantially about Blake, not for those with only, say, a chapter on Blake. These reviews are listed under the book reviewed; the authors of the reviews may be recovered from the index.</p>
            <p>I take <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (1977) and <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> (1995), faute de mieux, to be the standard bibliographical authorities on Blake<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> and have noted significant differences from them. <note id="n1"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Except for the states of the plates for Blake’s commercial book engravings, where the standard authority is R.N. Essick, <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations</hi> (1991).</note></p>
            <p>N.b. I have made no systematic attempt to record manuscripts, typescripts, computer printouts, radio or television broadcasts, calendars, exhibitions without catalogues,<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> festivals and lecture series, furniture with inscriptions, microforms,<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> music, performances,<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> pillows (decorated), poems, posters, published scores, recorded readings and singings, refrigerator magnets,<ref target="n5" type="note">5</ref> rubber stamps, tiles, T-shirts, tatoos, video-recordings,<ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref> or email related to Blake.<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref><note id="n2"><hi rend="s">2</hi> E.g., “Tyger of Wrath: William Blake in the National Gallery of Victoria” (Melbourne, Australia), which opened on 27 April 1999.</note><note id="n3"><hi rend="s">3</hi> E.g., <hi rend="i">Coloured Engravings to Edward Young’s “Night Thoughts” from Sir John Soane’s Museum</hi> (Microforms Academic).</note><note id="n4"><hi rend="s">4</hi> For instance, the “literary freak-show” called “The Animated Blake” “created and performed by James Jay” at the Seattle Fringe Festival, March 1999; see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 32 (1998-99): 87.</note><note id="n5"><hi rend="s">5</hi> “The Tyger” (4 lines), “The Sick Rose” (8 lines), and “Ah!

            <p>The status of electronic “publications” becomes increasingly vexing. Some such works seem to be merely electronic versions of physically stable publications, such as <hi rend="i">Colliers Encyclopedia-CD Rom</hi> (1996), with essays by Charles P. Parkhurst, Jr., on Fuseli and Flaxman and by Geoffrey Keynes on Blake (1966) &lt;<hi rend="i">BB</hi> #2040, which replaced that by Mark Schorer and Charles P. Parkhurst, Jr., <hi rend="i">BB</hi> #2673&gt;. Some electronic publications, however, suggest no more knowledge than how to operate a computer, such as those invited for the listings of the book-sale firm of amazon.com, which are divided into those by (1) the author, (2) the publisher, and (3) other, perhaps disinterested, remarkers. I have not searched for electronic publications, and I report here only those I have happened upon which appear to bear some authority.<ref target="n8" type="note">8</ref> The most important of these are the William Blake

              <p>Blake’s Original Writings</p>
              <p>A previously unknown copy of “Albion Rose” (E) was discovered in a most intriguing context. It came from the library of a Spanish hunting enthusiast who did not read English or recognize what he had accidentally acquired.<ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref> It bears a remarkable annotation apparently by Blake connecting a book on rifles (1813) to an apocalyptic passage from Ezekiel. As with a number of recent Blake discoveries, the lack of precedent is one of its guarantors of integrity. Blake is rarely predictable. <note id="n11"><hi rend="s">11</hi> See William Cole, “An Unknown Fragment by William Blake: Text, Discovery, and Interpretation,” <hi rend="i">MP</hi> 96 (1999): 485-491.</note></p>
              <p>A copy of “Blake’s Chaucer: The Canterbury Pilgrims” (B) has lain unobserved for 165 years in a copy of <hi rend="i">The Canterbury Pilgrims</hi>, ed. Thomas Tyrwhitt (1798) in the Bodleian Library until it was recorded by J. B. Mertz in 1999.<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> It is only the second copy known. <note id="n12"><hi rend="s">12</hi> See J. B. Mertz, “An Unrecorded Copy of Blake’s 1809 Chaucer Prospectus,” <hi rend="i">Blake 32</hi> (1998-99): 73-74.</note></p>
              <pb id="p33-137" n="137"/>
              <p>In 1999 the most exciting discovery or recovery was of <hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen</hi> (copy E),<ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref> partly colored about 1841 (see illus. A-G above). It was bought at a cost ($2,500,000 + agent’s fee) which exceeds the price per page of any book previously sold at auction. It has gone to the most lavishly funded Blake collection formed in the last 40 years and now is exceedingly difficult to see. Of course this does not mean that <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> is really worth $100,000 per print; it only means that two or more very wealthy bidders think it is. As one of the bidders was apparently a dealer, this suggests his belief that there are potential buyers willing to pay even more than $100,000 per print for Blake’s most ambitious color-printed works. <note id="n13"><hi rend="s">13</hi> See Dr. Elizabeth B. Bentley, <hi rend="i">“Urizen in New York City,” Blake</hi> 33 (1999): 27-30.</note></p>
              <p><hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (E) was in North America as early as 1905 and was acquired by Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney by 1919. The information about it available to Geoffrey Keynes for his great <hi rend="i">Bibliography of William Blake</hi> (1921) necessarily derived from catalogue descriptions by others (1876, 1886, 1919-20) and perhaps from correspondence with the family; he never saw <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (E) himself. When Mrs. Whitney died in 1942, <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (E) “disappeared” into the recesses of the family which had long owned it; their possessions were so vast, distributed among several dwellings in two countries, that they did not know they had it—or at any rate none of them could locate it when GEB wrote to every member of the family named in Mrs. Whitney’s will. When Edwin Wolf 2nd assisted Sir Geoffrey with descriptions of North American copies of Blake’s works in Illuminated Printing for their <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Illuminated Books:</hi> A Census (1953), <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (E) was still inaccessible, and no more information was available for <hi rend="i">A Blake Bibliography</hi> (1964), <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (1977), and <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> (1995).<ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref><note id="n14"><hi rend="s">14</hi> However, <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 169, surmised correctly that <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (E) did not contain two copies of pl. 12, as claimed by Keynes (1921) and Keynes &amp; Wolf (1953).</note></p>
              <p>When it was briefly visible at Sotheby’s in April 1999, <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> copy E proved to differ in a number of important respects from the descriptions of it by Geoffrey Keynes (1921) and Keynes and Wolf (1953). They said that it “Lacks pl. 4, 9, 16, and 24,” whereas in fact pl. 9 is present and pl. 25 is missing. In their description of the order of the plates (which differs in every copy of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi>), they give pl. “12” in place of pl. 9 as the fourth plate, apparently without recognizing that they had listed pl. 12 twice and had not listed pl. 25 at all.</p>
              <p>Keynes and Wolf had no way of knowing that on pl. 28 there is a copperplate-maker’s mark which has been recorded on no other copy of the print. This is yet another confirmation of the hypothesis that <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> is etched on the versos of other plates, almost certainly <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, whose dimensions are almost identical.</p>
              <p>Similarly, on pl. 9 is a grazing horse not visible in other copies, and on pl. 10 “Chap: IV” has been altered to “Chap: III” (not recorded in any other copy), perhaps because “Chap: IV” also appears on pl. 8.</p>
              <p>Most sensationally, while most of the coloring is indisputably Blake’s—and exceedingly handsome (see illus. A-G)—some of it is very strange (see illus. A, C). A raspberry red on pl. 9 and 21 and black splotches on pl. 1, 21 apparently from an oxidized white are unlike Blake’s coloring elsewhere. These suspicious colors, and others such as the flesh-colors on pl. 7 and 21, were apparently added by a hand other than that of Blake or his wife.</p>
              <p>Such suspicions seem to be confirmed by a very curious feature of pl. 21. Wet ink from the print was transferred to a guard-leaf facing pl. 21, and the guard-leaf was apparently not added until 1841. Apparently some of the prints of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (E) were touched up rather crudely about 1841, and the ink was still so fresh that it transferred to the guard-leaf when the work was rebound.</p>
              <p>If <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (E) was touched up long after Blake’s death, we should be newly alert to the possibility that other colored copies of his works in Illuminated Printing were also touched up. The stigmata of such posthumous coloring may include white oxidized to black, a strange raspberry red, and inconsistency within the coloring pattern. (Of course, such inconsistency may also indicate that Blake himself colored the work at two different periods.)</p>
              <p>We have known of monochrome copies of Blake’s works in Illuminated Printing which were colored later, sometimes, as in the cases of <hi rend="i">America</hi> (Q) and <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (L), with fraudulent intent by the now-notorious dealer Walter T. Spencer,<ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref> but no copy of a book undoubtedly colored by Blake has previously been detected with coloring added after his death.<ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref><note id="n15"><hi rend="s">15</hi> Spencer also sold <hi rend="i">For Children</hi> (C), <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (E, J), <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (F, L), the letter of 18 March 1827, and the MS of “then she bore Pale desire,” but no one has blown upon their integrity. <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (j) was printed post-humously on paper watermarked J WHATMAN | [18]31 and colored for an unknown patron by 1925. In <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (e), some plates printed and colored by Blake were added to others posthumously printed and colored apparently for Toovey after 1862.</note><note id="n16"><hi rend="s">16</hi> Blake’s Bunyan drawings (c. 1825) were colored at least in part by another hand, perhaps by Catherine Blake when Blake was ill (1825-27) or after his death.</note></p>

            </head>
            <p>A number of new editions of Blake’s writings are recorded here, none with scholarly or critical pretensions. The most curious of them is <hi rend="i">The Healing Power of Blake</hi>, which is somewhat oblique to the flow of Blake studies. The pages are printed sideways, and the snippets quoted are often adjusted, including “versifying his prose.” The purpose of the selections is to “raise our Life Energy,” and the editor, Dr. John Diamond, has therefore “used him [<hi rend="i">Blake</hi>], more than all the other poets . . . as an essential component of my healing practice.”</p>

              </title>
            </head>
            <p>The most important development with respect to Blake’s purely visual art is the appearance of a major new collector, who has never indulged in major works by Blake before. Allan Parker has acquired both the fascinating series of designs illustrating Bunyan’s <hi rend="i">Pilgrim’s Progress</hi>, sold by the Frick Collection in New York where they had been for half a century, and the extraordinary Large Blake-Varley Sketchbook which appeared suddenly in 1989 and was sold to an anonymous collector in 1998. Parker’s Blake drawings may well be the most extensive such collection in private hands today.</p>
            <p>A more curious development is the identification for the first time of the Folio Blake-Varley Sketchbook. The original has long since been dismembered, but its newly-recorded dimensions and watermark make it plain that only three leaves from it can be traced today, though at least three others are known from their titles. There is probably a good deal yet to be discovered about the nature and extent of Blake’s Visionary Heads.</p>

              </title>
            </head>
            <p>No new commercial engraving by Blake was discovered, but copies of three of the rarest of commercial books with Blake engravings have been acquired by the most industrious, learned, and devoted Blake collector active today. Robert N. Essick has managed to acquire during just the last year a set of all four parts from Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Designs to A Series of Ballads</hi> (1802—only seven other complete sets are known, one of them long untraced), Marie Vollstonecraft Godwin, <hi rend="i">Marie et Caroline</hi> (1799—only two other copies are recorded), and Young, <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> (1797). <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> is not a rare book—<hi rend="i">Blake Books, Blake Books Supplement</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> record 125 copies, and I know of numerous others in private hands—but colored copies are uncommon, and there is still great uncertainty as to when and by whom they were colored. Essick’s newly acquired colored copy (AA) is fascinating in that it was colored in at least three sessions, the first c. 1800 (sensitively), the second in 1833, and the third in 1880-90. On the basis of the clear evidence of serial coloring which Essick provides from his copy, other colored copies should be re-examined to determine whether more than one hand can be detected in their coloring.</p>

            </head>
            <p>The only new exhibition recorded was that entitled <hi rend="i">Tyger of Wrath</hi>, with displays from the extraordinary Blake holdings of the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne on 28 April-30 June 1999. However, its significance can scarcely be judged at a distance, for apparently no catalogue was printed.</p>
            <p>In a sense, the most important Blake exhibition of 1999 was at the Sotheby (NY) sale of the Betsy Cushing Whitney estate on 23 April 1999. The exhibition was important not only because <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> copy E emerged from its long hibernation but because it has disappeared again into a collection which may prove almost as inaccessible as when the book belonged to the Whitney family. The difference is that the Whitney family did not know that they owned such a treasure — and the copy of <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> (N) which Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney acquired by 1921 has still not been found among the Whitney family treasures.</p>

              </title>
            </head>
            <p>The languages in which Blake criticism is published continues to be remarkably diverse: Besides English, there are publications on Blake in Dutch (1 essay), French (17), Italian (11), Japanese (8 plus 1 in English in a Japanese journal), Norwegian (1), Polish (1), Russian (12, plus 2 in English published in Russia), and Spanish (1).</p>
            <p>The volume of publication continues to be formidable. There are 14 newly recorded books on Blake and 194 essays. Of these 194 essays, 28 were in <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> (1998-99), 23 in <hi rend="i">Journal of the Blake Society at St James</hi> (1998-99), 7 in an issue of <hi rend="i">The Wordsworth Circle</hi> (1999), and 21 in volumes of essays—<hi rend="i">Da Blake al Modernismo:</hi> Saggi sulla eredità a romanticà, ed. Toni Cerutti (1993) and <hi rend="i">Blake in the Nineties</hi>, ed. Steve Clark and David Worrall (1999).</p>
            <p>In addition, there were 16 doctoral dissertations, at California (Irvine), Cambridge, Dallas, Essex, Georgia, Mississippi, Moscow, New South Wales, North Carolina, St. Petersburg, Sartanse (Russia), Tbilisi, Toronto, Vanderbilt, Victoria, Virginia, and Washington.</p>

            <p>Two new contemporary, or almost-contemporary, records of Blake have been published. Bernard Barton’s letter to Allan Cunningham of 24 February 1830 identifies several new admirers of Blake, including John Martin the visionary painter,<ref target="n18" type="note">18</ref> and an incidental reference by Sarah Flower Adams of 1835 places Blake in the context, though not in the company, of Charles Lamb and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.<ref target="n19" type="note">19</ref><note id="n18"><hi rend="s">18</hi> Joe Riehl, “Bernard Barton’s Contribution to Cunningham’s ‘Life of Blake’: A New Letter,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 33 (1999): 16-20.</note><note id="n19"><hi rend="s">19</hi> Y., S.

            <p>Far more important are two essays by Keri Davies whose research on Blake’s patrons is proving wonderfully profitable. In “William Blake’s Mother: A New Identification,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 33 (1999), he demonstrates that Catherine Blake’s maiden name was Wright, not Harmitage-Hermitage as previously claimed. Therefore she is not related to the Muggletonian sect through a (hypothetical) relative named George Harmitage or Hermitage, as E. P. Thompson and others had suggested. (“Harmitage” was always a red herring; her first husband’s name was certainly Armitage, though it was occasionally mistranscribed by others as “Harmitage,” on the same “Cockney” principle that “Anderson” was transcribed as “Handerson.”) Thanks to Keri Davies, we now know more about Blake’s maternal grandparents than we do about his paternal grandparents.</p>
            <p>Similarly important is his essay on “Mrs Bliss: a Blake Collector of 1794” in <hi rend="i">Blake in the Nineties</hi>, ed. Steve Clark and David Worrall (1999). There he describes the life and library of the earliest known Blake collector, of whom we previously knew little more than that her library was sold post-humously in 1825—we had not even known that the library then belonged to her dear friend Ann Whitaker, and that it was the death of Ann Whitaker in 1825 which precipitated the sale, not that of Rebekah Bliss, who died in 1819.</p>

            <p>Robert N. Essick, <hi rend="i">A Troubled Paradise:</hi> William Blake’s Virgil Wood Engravings with an afterword on collecting William Blake by John Windle (1999), is a brief, illuminating essay on Blake’s Virgil enterprise. William Vaughan, <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi> (1999) is an unambitious picture book about Blake’s art, almost distinct from his book of the same title of 22 years previously. Jason Whittaker, <hi rend="i">William Blake and the Myths of Britain</hi> (1999), discusses Blake in general, with a leitmotif of contemporary antiquarianism; he has little that was not in previous books on the subject such as Denis Saurat, <hi rend="i">Blake and Modern Thought</hi> (1929), Ruthven Todd, <hi rend="i">Tracks in the Snow</hi> (1946), and especially A. L. Owen, <hi rend="i">The Famous Druids</hi> (1962).</p>
            <p>A work of quite surprising factual usefulness is the index to the Farington Diary which was finally published 15 years after the last of Farington’s text, in two volumes (1999). Farington was a famous artistic gossip and Royal Academy politician, and almost any aspect of genteel London life about 1800 might appear in his pages—and be recovered through this admirable index.</p>
            <p>The most important book about Blake published in 1999 was Christopher Z. Hobson, <hi rend="i">The Chained Boy:</hi> Orc and Blake’s Idea of Revolution (1999). Hobson argues that Orc is central to Blake’s social myth but that he has been regularly misunderstood. Orc is not a rebel-turned-tyrant, as Northrop Frye argued in his influential formulation of the “Orc Cycle.” Rather he is a perennially imprisoned representative of the downtrodden masses, and in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> “Blake endorses both revolutionary violence and the specific policies of the Jacobin dictatorship” (147). The work is very responsibly argued, and, while many critics will be reluctant to accept Hobson’s picture of Blake as a consistent social activist, all careful readers will have to weigh his arguments about Orc’s uncorrupted energy—and many will be persuaded, as I am.</p>
            <p>But when the word “‘Liberty’ necessarily recalls [<hi rend="i">to Hobson</hi>] ‘Wilkes and Liberty’ and the Liberty Tree,” rather than, say, “liberty of the press” of Junius or “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” of the Declaration of Independence, one may recall his statement that “my own [<hi rend="i">Marxist</hi>] political evolution . . . seem[<hi rend="i">s</hi>] to me very close to Blake’s” (160,9) and suspect that his discovery of pervasive and violent radical politics in Blake says as much about Hobson as it does about Blake.</p>
            <p>Because of linguistic poverty, I cannot comment on Junee Giftarmälet, <hi rend="i">mellom himmel og helvete</hi> [<hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>], tr.

            </head>
            <p>One of the most important new essays on Blake is Joseph Viscomi, “In the Caves of Heaven and Hell: Swedenborg and Printmaking in Blake’s <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi>” in <hi rend="i">Blake in the Nineties</hi>, ed. Steve Clark and David Worrall (1999). This is the culmination of three essays on the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> which are likely to be a central focus of future essays on the <hi rend="i">Marriage.</hi> They are
<pb id="p33-140" n="140"/>
an admirable augury of his eagerly awaited second volume of <hi rend="i">Blake and the Idea of the Book.</hi></p>
            <p>In “[‘]What Is the Price of Experience?[’] William Blake and the Economics of Illuminated Painting [<hi rend="i">i.e., Printing</hi>],” <hi rend="i">University of Toronto Quarterly</hi> 68 (1999), G. E. Bentley, Jr., argues that Blake probably lost money on most of his works in Illuminated Printing such as <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, and <hi rend="i">America.</hi> The only works which may have proved marginally profitable are <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience, The First Book of Urizen</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> because they entailed no new expense for copperplates, since they were etched on the versos of other works.</p>
            <p>David Worrall, “Blake and 1790s Plebian Radical Culture” in <hi rend="i">Blake in the Nineties</hi>, ed. Steve Clark and David Worrall (1999), makes a persuasive case for the echoes in Blake’s verse of what he calls “1790s plebeian radical discourse.”</p>
            <p>Far more incidentally, there are essays on why the Welsh are enthusiastic singers of Blake’s “Jerusalem” lyric (they translate England as Cymru, Welsh for the people)<ref target="n20" type="note">20</ref> and the Scots are not (they gibe at singing of “England’s green &amp; pleasant Land”).<ref target="n21" type="note">21</ref> And there is some curious gossip about places where Blake once lived. In 1917 his cottage in Felpham was suffering “an almost unprecedented act of vandalism” in being altered<ref target="n22" type="note">22</ref>—ironically restoring it to the form in which Blake knew it in; 1918 his house in Lambeth was about to be torn down;<ref target="n23" type="note">23</ref> and in 1968 his flat in South Molton Street was being converted to a betting shop or couturier.<ref target="n24" type="note">24</ref><note id="n20"><hi rend="s">20</hi> G.

            <p>Some byways explored recently are unlikely to be travelled by many others. One example may be termed Galloping Anagramism—deriving the word “Bromion,” for instance, from “I’m no orb,” “No I rob ‘m’,” “Iron mob,” “I’m born O,”<ref target="n25" type="note">25</ref> derivations which reveal much more about the ingenuity of their perpetrator than about the significance of the term or Blake’s intentions. <note id="n25"><hi rend="s">25</hi> Christopher Rubinstein, “‘The Eye Sees More than the Heart Knows’: Some possible hidden meanings in <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion,” Journal of the Blake Society at St James</hi>, 4 (1999): 66-75. He believes that “There is at least a strong probability that he [<hi rend="i">Blake</hi>] was aware of them and created the names accordingly” (68).</note></p>
            <p>Similarly, Blake’s connection with secret orders such as the Masons seems to be based upon the most superficial similarities.<ref target="n26" type="note">26</ref> Blake’s mysteries were his own, not borrowed from the world of secret handshakes and cobbled Egyptian rituals. <note id="n26"><hi rend="s">26</hi> See Marsha Keith Schuchard, “Blake and the Grand Masters (1791-4): Architects of Repression or Revolution?,” <hi rend="i">Blake in the Nineties</hi>, ed.

                  <p>Binding: Trimmed to 25.2 × 19 cm (removing the engraved inscription) and folded neatly into quadrants; unfolded and framed in the autumn of 1995. On the verso is a pencil inscription in a hand which resembles Blake’s:
<q>
Does the unblemish’d Lamb subjected to | Baker’s Practice bring delivrance | With His Suffering? Might He Save | Jerusalem from destruction, or wilt | Thou have Thy vengeance for man’s | outrages? Wouldst Thou make a full | end of the remnant?
</q></p>
                  <p>The passage alludes to Ezekiel 11:13; 46:13: “Ah Lord God! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?”; “Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a Lamb of the first year without a blemish”; and to Ezekiel Baker, <hi rend="i">Thirty-Three Years Practise and Observations with Rifle Guns</hi> (1813), into which the print was once folded.</p>

                  <p>Copy E</p>
                  <p>Copperplate-Maker’s Mark: On pl. 28 is a very clear copperplate-maker’s mark of Pontifex (as in Jones and Pontifex in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pl. 1-2, 4-18, and I Pontifex and Co. in Job pl. 2-13, 15, 17-21, and Dante) which has apparently not been previously recorded and which is not visible in reproductions of copies A-B, D, and G. It is another indication that this plate, and probably the others in <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi>, were etched on the versos of the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (see <hi rend="i">BB</hi> 166-67).</p>
                  <p>Coloring</p>
                  <p>The text is never colored except for occasional brown touches on the vines and birds, though the designs are very heavily colored. Most pink flesh seems to be watercolored. The work was probably color-printed at the same time as copies A, C-D, F, and J, about 1795.</p>
                  <p>However, some colors were apparently added much later. There are black splotches, especially on pl. 1 (illus. A) and pl. 21, as if from oxidized white lead, a color not used in the other copies of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> printed at the same time. Pl. 9 (illus. C) and pl. 21 exhibit a strange raspberry red which is not found in the other copies of this print-run—or perhaps elsewhere in Blake’s coloring. On pl. 7 and pl. 21 the flesh is heavily colored in an unBlake-like way so that the muscles and underlying printing are invisible.</p>
                  <p>These oddities on pl. 1, 7, 9, 21 and elsewhere suggest, as R. N. Essick points out (“Blake in the Marketplace, 1999,” in this issue), that <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (E) was touched up by someone other than the Blakes after the first coloring.</p>
                  <p>The guard-leaf facing pl. 21 was added when the ink was still moist enough to transfer to it. As the guard-leaves were apparently added when Clarke and Bedford bound the book c. 1841, this suggests that the coloring of pl. 21 and probably the other late coloring such as the raspberry red and the lead white were added about 1841.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps the person who commissioned the binding of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (E) about 1841 was the one who arranged for the new coloring of it. This person may have been Charles Wentworth Dilke (1789-1864), whose son Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke (1810-69) is the first recorded owner of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (E).<ref target="n33" type="note">33</ref> About 1840, the first Charles Wentworth Dilke “formed one of the best collections of Blake’s drawings, and 
<pb id="p33-142" n="142"/>
was one of the earliest admirers of his poems.”<ref target="n34" type="note">34</ref> Certainly he was interested in Blake at this time, for about 1843 he visited John Linnell “to have another morning with Blake,”<ref target="n35" type="note">35</ref> he bought Blake’s Job and Dante engravings from Linnell in February 1843 and November 1844,<ref target="n36" type="note">36</ref> and Linnell wrote to Dilke about the Job borders on 27 September 1844.<ref target="n37" type="note">37</ref><note id="n33"><hi rend="s">33</hi> Similarly the first Charles Wentworth Dilke may have commissioned Charles Murton about 1838 to bind the copy of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> (K) later owned by his son.

                  <p>Pl. 20 The flames round the child are lemon yellow, others tawny brown and orange to dark brown; the vines are touched with brown.</p>
                  <p>Pl. 21 The flesh is pink, the man darker than the woman and boy; the man has brown hair, the others are blond; the chain is an odd red; the hammer is brown; the background is dark brown, orange, and at top is some red and orange.</p>
                  <p>Pl. 22 The man is pink and brown, and the chains are black; the light from his head is orange, the background black (see illus. F).</p>
                  <p>Pl. 23 Flesh is pink, the clothes uncolored; the globe and rays are red; the very clear lion is brown; the background is mostly mottled brown; above the rocks is purplish blue.</p>
                  <p>Pl. 26 The boy’s hair is brown, his clothes uncolored; the dog black and white, the background mottled brown (see illus. G).</p>
                  <p>Pl. 27 The man’s flesh is pink, his hair brown, his clothes uncolored; the background is mottled brown to blue.</p>
                  <p>Pl. 28 The man is outlined in brown, his flesh is pink, and his clothes uncolored; the rope is black, and the background black (bottom) and very dark blue (top).</p>
                  <p>Variants: The control text was the Blake Trust facsimile (1995) of copy D. Features such as faces, toes, and hands, are mostly <hi rend="i">not</hi> touched up by hand as in copy D. The running-head is clear on pl. 5, 10, 12 (not visible in D), 14 (very faint in D), 16, 18, 20, 26.</p>
                  <p>Pl. 2 There is a crease in the paper across the woman’s back and arm, and the plants are quite thin and slight.</p>
                  <p>Pl. 5 The man looks at the viewer (not down as in D) (see illus. B).</p>
                  <p>Pl. 6 Vine-flourishes (added by hand on the paper, not printed from the copperplate) cover the gap in text at the right.</p>
                  <p>Pl. 9 The head of a grazing horse is fairly clear to the right of the man (see illus. D). In copies A-B, D, G that area is plainly rocks.</p>
                  <p>Pl. 10 “Chap: IV” has been altered to “Chap: III,” apparently by scratching out the “IV” on the paper and altering it in the color of the printing-ink to “III.”</p>
                  <p>Pl. 11 There is no sign of the tree(?) above the right man’s knee which is clear in copy D.</p>
                  <p>Pl. 14 There is similar striation to copy D on the cloud over the man’s leg and in his hair but little elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>Pl. 15 The old men’s eyes look down (left) or are closed (right), not looking forward as in D. The right man’s beard overlaps the sea, and there are swirls as of cloth above his head.</p>
                  <p>Pl. 17 The object which is fairly clearly a sash (leaving buttocks and legs bare) is blood or veins in D; the globe is not luminous. There is no hint of bloody veins flowing from the person’s head to the globe.</p>
                  <p>Pl. 18 There is a shadow to the left from his left leg (see illus. E).</p>
                  <pb id="p33-143" n="143"/>
                  <p>Pl. 21 There is disfiguring black on Enitharmon’s cheek, perhaps oxidation. Los looks at Orc (not at Enitharmon, as in D).</p>
                  <p>On pl. 21, at the left side about a third of the way from the top, is a patch of very dark brown coloring with some fragments of paper clinging to it,<ref target="n38" type="note">38</ref> which corresponds to a discolored hole in the facing guard-leaf and to dark brown fragments opposite the guard-leaf hole on the verso of the previous leaf (pl.20). This suggests that the guard-leaf was there when the coloring was still wet or humid. However, the plate-versos have offsets from the facing plates, indicating that these offsets occurred before the guard-leaves were added. Apparently part of the coloring was added about the same time as the guard-leaves, c. 1841. <note id="n38"><hi rend="s">38</hi> There is a similar defect in the brown of the man’s left knee on pl. 21 but nothing corresponding on the guard-leaf.</note></p>
                  <p>Pl. 23 There are six spikes from the globe (rather than eight as in D) and a line on the man’s left wrist as of a gown or an anachronistic wrist-watch (not visible in D).</p>
                  <p>Pl. 26 Light comes from the top left (see illus. G).</p>
                  <p>Pl. 27 There are very few of the striations visible in D.</p>
                  <p>Pl. 28 Yellow lines flow unambiguously from the man’s head.</p>
                  <p>Binding: Bound about 1841 by “CLARKE &amp; BEDFORD” (partners in 1841-50), whose names are stamped on the verso of the first fly-leaf, with three fly-leaves at front and three at the back (the last watermarked “J WHATMAN | TURKEY MILL | 1839”) and with unwatermarked guard-leaves,<ref target="n39" type="note">39</ref> in brown morocco, elaborately gilt, all edges gilt<ref target="n40" type="note">40</ref> (including the fly-leaves), scattered foxing. The spine at front is separating from the text. No stab hole from the previous sewing is visible. <note id="n39"><hi rend="s">39</hi> The presence of offsets on the versos of the plate-leaves indicates that the guard-leaves were not present when the work was first bound. Sometimes there is surprisingly heavy show-through on the versos of heavily printed leaves.</note><note id="n40"><hi rend="s">40</hi> The leaves with pl. 7 and 15 are slightly shorter than the others, ragged at bottom, and therefore not gilt. This suggests that the trimming in 1841 was not very drastic.</note></p>

None of the uncorrected copies has a known history earlier than 1885, except for those belonging to Samuel Palmer.</note></p>
                  <p>One uncorrected copy of <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> (R) still survives in the original unstitched sheets in which it was given to Blake in 1783. This copy belonged to Blake’s young friend Samuel Palmer, and so did half a dozen other copies which were still in sheets as late as 1862.</p>
                  <p>John Linnell Jr. wrote on the fly-leaf of <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> copy G:
<q>
I found in M<hi rend="s">r</hi>. Palmer’s store room at Furze Hill House [<hi rend="i">where Palmer lived 1862-1881</hi>], <hi rend="u">3</hi> copies of this book <hi rend="u">in sheets</hi> [<hi rend="i">copies G, H?, U?</hi>], (one [<hi rend="i">U?</hi>] not quite perfect)—S.P. told me to take one for my self—I had this copy half bound . . . A. H. Palmer sold one of his copies for £20. . . .<ref target="n43" type="note">43</ref><note id="n43"><hi rend="s">43</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Books</hi> 349nl.</note></q></p>
                  <p>And nine years after Samuel Palmer died, his son A. H. Palmer wrote to the antiquarian book firm of Pearson on 5 May 1890:
<pb id="p33-144" n="144"/><q>
The two copies of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> [<hi rend="i">copies A, N</hi>], you have just purchased, are, to the best of my belief, all that [<hi rend="i">still</hi>] existed among my father’s papers or books. Upon searching through them before giving up the house at Red Hill last March [<hi rend="i">1890</hi>], I found the copies in a parcel of old letters which had been put away in 1861 [<hi rend="i">when Samuel Palmer moved to Furze Hill House</hi>], and evidently forgotten. One sheet was missing, but this I afterwards found among other papers.<ref target="n44" type="note">44</ref><note id="n44"><hi rend="s">44</hi> The letter with <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> copy N is transcribed in Willis Vickery, <hi rend="i">Three Excessively Rare and Scarce Books and Something of Their Author</hi> (Cleveland: Printed for the Author, 1927) 19.</note></q></p>
                  <p>We do not know when and under what circumstances Samuel Palmer acquired these copies of <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> in sheets, but we may speculate. Since Linnell bought a copy from Mrs. Blake in 1831, perhaps Palmer acquired all those left at her death that year.</p>
                  <p>What Copies Did Palmer Own?</p>
                  <p>Samuel Palmer’s own copy of <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> was copy R, and he gave copy G to John Linnell Jr. Samuel Palmer was probably the friend of Blake who lent a copy of <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> to Alexander Gilchrist (d. 1861); this is apparently copy I, which was sold uncut in 1888 as Gilchrist’s copy.</p>
                  <p>Among Samuel Palmer’s papers, his son A. H. Palmer found a number of copies of <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches.</hi> “One of these copies [Copy A] afterward [<hi rend="i">June 1890</hi>] was sent to the British Museum,” as Pearson annotated the May 1890 letter above.<ref target="n45" type="note">45</ref><note id="n45"><hi rend="s">45</hi> Copy A was sold by Quaritch to the British Museum (now the British Library) on 15 June 1890.</note></p>
                  <p>A second copy of <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> found by A. H. Palmer in his father’s collection is copy N, referred to in the 1890 letter; it was in the sale of Thomas Gaisford on 23 April 1890.</p>
                  <p>A third is copy U (with the last three leaves in facsimile) sold by A. H. Palmer to John Pearson, who offered it in his Catalogue 60 (?1885).</p>
                  <p>In addition, A. H. Palmer may have been the source of copy H which Pearson sold in 1916.</p>
                  <p>Samuel Palmer thus owned copies A, G, I, N, R, and U and perhaps copy H as well. This includes all the uncorrected copies of <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> save copies K-M, P, and X whose histories are not known before the twentieth century; perhaps Palmer owned them as well.</p>
                  <p>The Condition of Palmer’s Copies</p>
                  <p>All the copies of <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> which Palmer certainly owned were in sheets when he got them.</p>
                  <p>Since one of the two copies found by A. H. Palmer [<hi rend="i">copies A, N</hi>] lacked a sheet which was later located, presumably these two copies were still in sheets when he found them.<ref target="n46" type="note">46</ref><note id="n46"><hi rend="s">46</hi> The two copies in sheets “forgotten” since 1861 and found in 1890 by A. H. Palmer must be different from the three copies in sheets found between 1862 and 1881 by John Linnell Jr.</note></p>
                  <p>Copy U was defective, missing the last three leaves;<ref target="n47" type="note">47</ref> these were replaced in facsimile before 1885. With copy U should be associated copies K-L, and P which also have leaves supplied in facsimile. It seems exceedingly likely that these defective copies came from Samuel Palmer. This would mean that copies A, G, I, K-L, N, P, R, and U all belonged to Samuel Palmer. <note id="n47"><hi rend="s">47</hi> In copies K-L, P, U, gatherings H, I, and K are in facsimile. (In copy P, only gatherings I and K are in facsimile.) Copy Q has leaf [A2] in facsimile, probably supplied at a different time for a different owner, for Blake’s manuscript corrections in copy Q indicate that he prepared it for a friend.</note></p>
                  <p>All Palmer’s copies A, G, I, N, R, and U were in sheets. It therefore seems likely that copies K-L, and P were also in sheets when Palmer received them.</p>
                  <p>“The facsimile pages were printed . . . before 1887, when they were described in a Pearson catalogue, and probably before the death in 1883 of Francis Bedford, who bound copies K and U.”<ref target="n48" type="note">48</ref> It seems virtually certain that the facsimile leaves were provided either by Samuel Palmer or after his death in 1881 by his son A. H. Palmer. <note id="n48"><hi rend="s">48</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Books</hi> 345. Bedford also bound copies H-I, N, and X.</note></p>
                  <p>Copy A</p>
                  <p>History: (1) Acquired by Samuel Palmer, perhaps after the death of Catherine Blake in 1831, put away with old letters in 1861, and rediscovered in March 1890 by his son (2) A. H. Palmer (according to the letter he wrote now with copy N); A. H. Palmer sold it to the dealer John Pearson; (3) Sold by the dealer Quaritch on 19 June 1890 for £42 to (4) The <hi rend="i">British Museum.</hi><ref target="n49" type="note">49</ref><note id="n49"><hi rend="s">49</hi> The copy which Crabb Robinson gave in May 1848 to J. J. G. Wilkinson cannot be copy A, as <hi rend="i">BB</hi> suggests. Perhaps it was copy Q.</note></p>
                  <p>Copy N</p>
                  <p>History: (1) Acquired by Samuel Palmer, perhaps after the death of Catherine Blake in 1831; tucked away “in a parcel of old letters which had been put away in 1861” and found in March 1890 by (2) A. H. Palmer (according to his letter of 5 May 1890 still with copy N), who sold it and copy A to the dealer John Pearson; (3) Acquired by Thomas Gaisford, who added his book-plate, and sold it at Sotheby’s, 23 April 1890, lot 184, for £48 to Quaritch. . . .</p>

I have used him, more than all the other poets . . . as an essential component of my healing practice” (6). The excerpts are mostly from Blake’s prophecies, and “I have taken many liberties with them, even versifying his prose” and repunctuating the text (11).</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In his biography of Blake in his <hi rend="i">Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects</hi> (1830),<ref target="n52" type="note">52</ref> Allan Cunningham described “a large book filled with drawings,” which included “Pindar as he stood a conqueror in the Olympic games,” Corinna, Lais the Courtesan, the “task-master whom Moses slew in Egypt,” Herod, and “a fiend” who “resembles . . . two men . . . a great lawyer, and a suborner of false witnesses.”<ref target="n53" type="note">53</ref> Only three of these Visionary Heads survive today: Pindar, Corinna, and Lais.<ref target="n54" type="note">54</ref> The leaves are virtually identical in size: Pindar: 41.5 × 26 cm; Corinna 26.2 × 41.7 cm; Lais 26.7 × 41.9 cm. Note that leaves razored out of a volume are likely to differ significantly in width (as these do) but not much in height.

                  <p>Further, the drawings are on paper bearing the watermark W TURNER &amp; SON,<ref target="n55" type="note">55</ref> and this watermark is found on no other surviving drawing, manuscript, or print by Blake. <note id="n55"><hi rend="s">55</hi> The watermark is not known for Pindar (#710), which has not been recorded since 1942.</note></p>

                  <p>All these drawings belonged to John Varley, for whom most of the Visionary Heads were made and who is apparently the “friend” who showed Cunningham the volume.</p>

                <p>Essick’s text (7-13) is a history and evaluation of Blake’s designs; “technique became the determiner of style. . . . Every cut is a vector of energy” (9).

              <p>I Alexander S. Gourlay, <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 32 (1998-99): 74-75 (because “the topic is simply too large and too complex to be susceptible to summary on this scale . . . the result is barely adequate even as an overview” [74]).</p>

              <p>The book is divided into two sections. The first is a series of essays (with an index) on large subjects such as “Viewing” (187-97, by Suzanne Matheson), “Prints” (207-14, by David Bindman), and “Poetry” (220-29, by Jerome McGann). Of course most of these essays are careful summaries of existing knowledge, but that by Suzanne Matheson on “Viewing” (i.e., exhibitions) is an original contribution to the field.</p>
              <p>The second half of the book is an alphabetical encyclopedia which seems to be about half biographical. The individuals comprehended include William Blake (Jon Mee), John Flaxman (D. W. Dörrbecker), Henry Fuseli (DWD), William Hayley (JM), Joseph Johnson (JM) and his Circle (JM), John Linnell (JM), “London’s most celebrated gentleman thief,” William Owen Pughe, William Sharp (DWD), J.G. Stedman, Thomas Stothard (DWD), Emanuel Swedenborg, and Thomas Taylor. There is nothing on R.H. Cromek or George Cumberland or James Parker.</p>
              <p>The rest of the encyclopaedia is devoted to abstractions such as Amiens (Peace of), Gagging Acts, the Gordon Riots, History Painting, Pious Perjury, Rebellion of 1798, the Society for Constitutional Information, the Society for the Suppression of Vice, and Treason Trials (notice the emphasis on politics).</p>
