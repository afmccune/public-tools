          <p>William Blake’s epic poem <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> has been
                        read in varying ways: as a dream, as a psychological account of fragmented
                        consciousness, and as an attack on Newtonian science, to name a few.<ref target="n0" type="note">*</ref> For
                        those critics also focusing on the physical state(s) of the manuscript
                        itself, <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> is everything from an abandoned and
                        tragic failure to a remarkable experiment with flexible poetics.
                        Blake’s eclectic, syncretic mythology and the
                        “unstable” status of this unfinished work welcome these
                        readings. Begun c. 1797 (the date on the title page) and revised until
                        possibly 1810 or even later (see Bentley 157-66), the epic grows out of a
                        revolutionary decade for society and for the literary practices that
                        influenced many of Blake’s earlier writings. One such revolution that
                        has been largely overlooked in studies of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> is
                        the changing view of sentimentalism, which was a philosophical and literary
                        movement especially prominent throughout the eighteenth century.<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> Riding a wave started by earlier critics
                        who targeted sentimentalism, radical writers focused on its emphasis on
                        emotion and sympathetic benevolence between individuals. But they also
                        attacked the tendency of sentimentalism, unless guided by reason, to weaken
                        or (as some saw it) “feminize” society, to encourage hypocrisy
                        and self-gratifying charity, and to foster a predatory system of
                        victimization. Their attack often took a gendered form, for critics saw
                        sentimentalism as a dividing force between the sexes that also created weak
                        victims or crafty tyrants within the sexes. <note id="n0">* I would like to thank Dennis Welch at Virginia Tech and John
                            O’Brien and Jerome McGann at the University of Virginia for their
                            helpful comments and suggestions during the preparation of this
                            essay.</note><note id="n1">1. Although some
                            scholars have noted the connection between Blake and sentimentality,
                            most treatments of this subject are portions of a larger discussion,
                            often related to gender and sexuality in Blake’s poetry (see my
                            bibliography). One noteworthy article is Andrew Lincoln’s
                            “Alluring the Heart to Virtue: Blake’s <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>,” in which the author examines “the rise
                            of affective devotion or ‘the religion of the
                            heart,’” “a religion grounded in affection [that
                            was] seen as a most effective instrument of social harmony and
                            control” (622, 623). Other helpful studies include Mary Kelly
                            Persyn’s article on sensibility, chastity, and sacrifice in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, and Judith Lee’s discussion of
                            Blake’s Emanations.</note></p>
          <p>Blake points out these negative characteristics of sentimentalism in
                        mythological terms with his vision of the fragmentation and fall of the
                        Universal Man Albion into male and female parts, Zoas and Emanations. In the
                        chaotic universe that results, sentimentalism is part of a
                        “system” that perpetuates suffering in the fallen world,
                        further dividing the sexes into their stereotypical roles. Although
                        “feminine” sentimentality serves as a force for reunion and
                        harmony, its connection with fallen nature and “vegetated”
                        life in Blake’s mythology turns it into a trap, at best a Band-Aid on
                        the mortal wound of the fall. For Blake, mutual sympathy in the fallen world
                        requires the additional strength and guidance of inspired vision (initiating
                        a fiery Last Judgment) in order to become truly redemptive, <hi rend="i">effective</hi> rather than merely <hi rend="i">affective.</hi> When
                        recounting humanity’s “Resurrection to Unity” and
                        “Regeneration” in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> (4:4-5, E
                        301), Blake frequently uses sentimental conventions both to characterize
                        fallen disorder and to show how it can be healed when incorporated into
                        spiritual vision.</p>
          <p>Although critics speak of the “Age of Sensibility,” the
                        “cult of sensibility,” “sentimental literature,”
                        and so forth, sensibility and/or sentimentality are often easier to describe
                        than to define. Indeed, as Janet Todd points out in <hi rend="i">Sensibility: An Introduction</hi>, writers in the eighteenth century
                        used the terms interchangeably and inconsistently (6).<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> However, we can identify some crucial distinctions
                        between these terms and, even more importantly, distinguish many of the
                        overall movement’s other key terms and features that will appear
                        again when we look at <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi><note id="n2">2. Todd’s book serves its titular purpose extremely
                            well for the general features of sentimentalism. For readers wishing to
                            pursue this topic, some other important works on specific aspects of
                            sentimentalism, such as its relation to culture/consumerism, politics,
                            and sexuality, are listed in my bibliography.</note></p>
          <p>In general, “sensibility” refers most directly to physical
                        feelings and emotions, as well as to the reification and display of
                        emotional refinement. Sensibility thus values delicacy and associated acts
                        such as crying, kneeling, fainting, and charity, and it is—as
                        sensibility makes clear—based on the natural responsiveness of the
                        bodily senses. “Sentimentality” also emphasizes emotions and
                        the body, but in a slightly different way. Sentiments are rational or moral
                        reflections, in sentimentalism usually connected to or inspired by the
                        emotions and related to the propriety of certain behaviors; thus,
                        sentimentality brings the mind into closer relationship with the natural
                        senses. As Jerome McGann succinctly puts it, “sensibility emphasizes
                        the mind in the body, sentimentality the body in the mind” (7).<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> The close connection between these two
                        terms grows even closer because “The adjective
                        ‘sentimental’” 
                        <pb id="p39-61" n="61"/> became a catchall phrase for sensibility <hi rend="i">and</hi> sentimentality (Todd 9). What is most important to
                        recognize is the emphasis given to the body, to the physical senses, as a
                        legitimate source of behavior and knowledge.<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref><note id="n3">3. Jane Austen exploits the varying connotations of
                            sentimental terms in <hi rend="i">Sense and Sensibility</hi> (begun
                            1797, published 1811) so as to critique/ parody the latter in contrast
                            to the former; however, her novel still retains a great deal of
                            sentimentality, positive and negative.</note><note id="n4">4. For this paper, I will use “sentimentality”
                            for the faculty and “sentimentalism” for the movement that
                            it fostered. For extended discussions and definitions of sentimental
                            terminology, see Brissenden, chapter 2 and 98-118, and Hagstrum, <hi rend="i">Sex and Sensibility</hi> 5-10.</note></p>
          <p>Given this prominence of the body, it makes sense that a key starting point
                        for the sentimental movement in England is the empiricist, or
                        “sensational” (Barker-Benfield 3), philosophy of John Locke.
                        In his <hi rend="i">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</hi> (1690), Locke
                        identifies the physical senses as the source of our ideas. Subsequent
                        philosophers, such as the third Earl of Shaftesbury and Francis Hutcheson,
                        developed Locke’s views with the addition of morality and aesthetics,
                        helping to define sentimentalism as a distinct movement by advocating the
                        cultivation of virtue. Benevolence is probably the most crucial element of
                        the Shaftesbury-Hutcheson brand of sentimentalism, especially since
                        benevolence was “in this period a ‘manly’ attribute
                        opposing ‘womanish’ self-interest and fear” (Todd 25).
                        David Hume and Adam Smith are other important figures, the latter especially
                        so with his <hi rend="i">Theory of Moral Sentiments</hi> (1759). In this
                        work, Smith views the emotions and sympathy between individuals as valid
                        social forces: by “entering into” another person via our
                        imagination, we can sympathize with that person and form a relationship (2).
                        More strikingly, his discussion of “unsocial,”
                        “social,” and “selfish” passions (part 1,
                        chapters 3, 4, and 5 respectively) and their role as determinant factors in
                        one’s “merit” or “demerit” in society
                        (part 2) goes far toward systematizing sentimentality in regard to public
                        displays of sentiment and subsequent social <hi rend="i">status.</hi> Given
                        Smith’s apparent exchange-value approach to human feelings, it is not
                        surprising that he later authored the great economic treatise <hi rend="i">The Wealth of Nations</hi> (1776).</p>
          <p>With these developments in sentimentalist philosophy, as well as in religion
                        in general and Methodism in particular, literature became probably the most
                        prominent venue in which the “cult of sensibility” practiced
                        its art and expounded its principles.<ref target="n5" type="note">5</ref> In
                        France, Jean-Jacques Rousseau united sentimental philosophy with fiction and
                        confessional, emphasizing the natural, sensual component of human nature,
                        and he had a strong influence on English sentimentalists. In England, Samuel
                        Richardson, Sarah Fielding, and Laurence Sterne in fiction, and Hannah More,
                        Thomas Gray, and Edward Young in poetry, were just a few of the authors
                        contributing to the vast corpus of sentimentalism and establishing a
                        distinctive “language of affective meanings” (McGann 6).
                        Although the amount of sentimental literature was enormous, we can cull out
                        some of the specific values that are crucial for understanding
                        Blake’s approach to sentimental literature. Sentimental writers
                        sought a heightened sense of <hi rend="i">pathos</hi> through stock
                        characters—virtuous heroines, benevolent heroes, wizened beggars,
                        distressed children—and trademark scenes of weeping, charity, and
                        especially hostility reconciled by emotional interaction among said
                        characters. Authors tried to forge a sympathetic, <hi rend="i">affective</hi> relationship between text and reader by depicting these
                        “natural victims” and the antagonistic society or characters
                        hounding them (Todd 3); a good reader was expected to respond with the
                        appropriate sentiment, while neophytes gained valuable instruction through
                        reading. What sentimental literature exploits, even <hi rend="i">requires</hi>, for its effect/affect, then, is a dichotomy of victim
                        and victimizer. It codifies, as it were, a “system” of
                        suffering and division while trying to create (and teach) sympathetic
                        affections. This dichotomy, however problematic it may be for
                        sentimentalism’s ostensible goals of mutual benevolence, most clearly
                        manifests in relation to gender—the expected qualities and behaviors
                        of each sex. Gender differences, in fact, largely define the system of
                        (sexual) virtue and antagonism, be it within a domestic family setting or
                        within society as a whole. As R. F. Brissenden famously puts it, “The
                        paradigm cliché” of sentimental literature is “virtue
                        in distress” (94), the situation in which we find the two most
                        enduring sentimental stereotypes: the chaste but embattled woman and the
                        good-hearted but doomed man of feeling. <note id="n5">5. Barker-Benfield
                            rightly identifies the “cult” (and its constituent cults)
                            as not just a literary trope, but also as an
                            “epiphenomenon” extending across the eighteenth-century
                            cultural spectrum, from religion to social behavior; he is most
                            concerned with this sentimental culture’s relationship to
                            “the rise of a consumer society” (xix). Along with
                            Barker-Benfield on sentimental religion, see Lincoln,
                            “Alluring.”</note></p>
          <p>The status of women in sentimental literature is indeed a <hi rend="i">pitiful</hi> one. Largely because of women’s “unique
                        sexual suffering” and “bodily authenticity,”
                        sensibility “stressed those qualities considered feminine in the
                        sexual psychology of the time: intuitive sympathy, susceptibility,
                        emotionalism and passivity” (Todd 110). In the foundational novels of
                        Richardson especially, weak and chaste women become ideal sentimental,
                        virtuous heroines. Clarissa Harlowe, for example, “is the symbol of
                        virtuous sensibility” in <hi rend="i">Clarissa</hi> because of her
                        “ailing body,” which signifies that she is “too good
                        for the world, and feels too much” (Mullan 111). Helping to clarify
                        this ideal and set the sentimental standards, a dichotomy exists even within
                        representations of women: wicked women, to contrast with the ideal heroines,
                        “simply lacked femininity and acquired masculine traits” (Todd
                        80). What we most commonly find in sentimental fiction, then, are laudably
                        passive women who face threats to their “virtue” from males or
                        some masculine antagonistic presence—victims and victimizers, such as
                        Clarissa and the rapist Lovelace. In the face of such victimization, we also
                        frequently find women (Pamela and Mrs. Jervis in <hi rend="i">Pamela</hi>,
                        for instance) who come together to share the heroine’s suffering,
                        which surely plays off stereotypical views of women as more emotional and
                        closer to the body. And all too often, the chaste embodiment of virtue
                        struggles in vain against her victimizer until she finds “no place to
                        rest but the grave” (Allen 128). The sinister nature of sentimental
                        femininity emerges in what these views imply: sentimental heroines <hi rend="i">need</hi>, as it were, to be persecuted “because
                        sensibility, <pb id="p39-62" n="62"/> and therefore virtue, is most excited,
                        and therefore most manifest, when threatened” (Mullan 124).<ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref> And the sexual dimension of
                        virtue’s distress is crucial, Hagstrum makes clear, because in many
                        cases rape (threatened or carried out), “far from spoiling the
                        sensuality [in a novel], actually heightens it for both sexes” (<hi rend="i">Sex and Sensibility</hi> 201). There is thus a dark subtext, as
                        it were, in sentimental literature: much as occurs in some shocking views of
                        rape (“She was asking for it”), the sentimental victim often
                        seems complicit in, or even responsible for, her attack. <note id="n6">6.
                            Richardson, writing to Lady Bradshaigh, is even more explicit on this
                            dire necessity in his sentimental fiction: “Clarissa has the
                            greatest of Triumphs even in this world. The greatest, I will venture to
                            say, even <hi rend="i">in</hi>, and <hi rend="i">after</hi> the Outrage
                            [of her rape], and <hi rend="i">because</hi> of the Outrage that ever
                            Woman had” (qtd. in Mullan 66).</note></p>
          <p>The “man of feeling” fares little better than his female
                        counterpart. Because sentimentalism was originally a male construct (from
                        Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, et al.) that appropriated “feminine”
                        qualities of emotional and bodily responsiveness, male sentimental
                        characters face fates similar to those of sentimental women. The man of
                        feeling fills his role by his “outflowings of emotion,” which
                        “teach response more than virtuous action” (Todd 92), so any
                        charitable acts play second fiddle to his hyperbolic sympathy. He therefore
                        sheds tears at almost every turn and is nearly incapacitated by any and
                        every scene that stirs his affections; he is mastered by, rather than master
                        of, his overpowering senses and feelings. For example, during a pitiful
                        story told by an insane mother, Harley in Henry Mackenzie’s <hi rend="i">The Man of Feeling</hi> (1771) paid “the tribute of some
                        tears,” “bathed [her hand] with his tears,” and then
                        “burst into tears” when departing (26, 27).<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> Weakened like Harley, the male sentimental
                        “hero” can hardly stand up to the hostile and unfeeling
                        society that opposes him, so that his heartfelt expressions of benevolence
                        and tenderness make him an easy victim. In general, then, a man of feeling
                        is irrevocably alienated from society because of his sentimentality, or he
                        inevitably meets an early death, in either case accomplishing little or
                        nothing for the greater good. Once again, the system of suffering becomes
                        self-indulgent and self-sustaining, and the victims “invite”
                        the forces attacking them in order to function as sympathetic <hi rend="i">characters.</hi> Gender identity and difference, both for female and
                        male characters, thus play determinant roles in the “order” of
                        this sentimental system. <note id="n7">7. An “Index to Tears”
                            appeared in the first edition of <hi rend="i">The Man of Feeling</hi>,

                            cause and effect, scene and response, in the sentimental system of
                            weeping. See Mackenzie 110-11.</note></p>
          <p>When we turn to <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, we find a similarly divided
                        and antagonistic situation. In Blake’s cosmological myth, the unity
                        of Albion has given way to warfare between the sexes and all of the
                        characters, wreaking havoc in the entire universal order and growing ever
                        more calamitous. Blake begins his epic <hi rend="i">in medias res</hi>, in
                        the world as we know it, and things are far from harmonious or Edenic. The
                        division of the androgynous Zoas into male Zoas and female Emanations is the
                        most glaring evidence that something has gone horribly wrong. Besides the
                        Zoas and Emanations, Blake’s mythology grows chaotically larger as
                        these parts of Albion’s ailing (sentimental) body split and transform
                        into Spectres, Shadows, Spirits, Orc the “reborn” Luvah, and
                        countless sons and daughters of various sorts. As is implied here, the key
                        concept is fragmentation.</p>
          <p>The very presence of divided sexes is in fact catastrophic. This is the case,
                        according to Blake, because in Eternity Albion is androgynous. However, the
                        exact natures of Albion and the Zoas are only known by “the Heavenly
                        Father,” which makes the Eternal Self eternally tricky, especially
                        when an “Individual” tries to understand it from below (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 3:7-8, E 301). While Blake asserts Albion’s
                        androgyny, his language and general presentation of Eternal life create a
                        great deal of difficulty in regard to the “sex” of Eternal
                        beings. Specifically, Blake’s is a masculine (at least
                        linguistically, at most ontologically) Eternity of Albion the
                        “Man” and the “Eternal Brotherhood.” As Leopold
                        Damrosch explains, the consequence is that it appears as if “the
                        female is fully integrated into the male” and that “The
                        androgynous self [Albion] is, in effect, a male self with a female element
                        within it” (182).<ref target="n8" type="note">8</ref> The female is
                        not separate but integrated, internalized, even more obviously than the
                        male. Blake’s writings frequently seem to bear this opinion out,
                        especially when he deals with fallen life. For example, Ahania becomes
                        Urizen’s “Shadowy Feminine Semblance,” and Urizen is
                        “Astonishd &amp; Confounded” to see “Her shadowy form
                        now Separate,” for now “Two wills they had two intellects
                        &amp; not as in times of old” (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 30:23, E 319;
                        30:45-48, E 320). The separation of an originally integrated portion of the
                        self, whether that self is androgynous or to some extent masculine, makes
                        the female extremely problematic in Blake’s mythology, since he
                        emphasizes its emanated, secondary nature. In its most negative forms, the
                        female will becomes the dreaded “Female Will,” while
                        femininity itself is “a symbol of otherness” representing
                        “Whatever Blake cannot reconcile himself to in the phenomenological
                        world—bodies, matter, nature, physical space” (Damrosch 183,
                        188). Thus, Blake’s females have a status similar to that of women in
                        sentimental literature, being linked to the body, senses, and emotions, and
                        in turn to the physical world, nature, and generation.<ref target="n9" type="note">9</ref> Just as writers and critics of sentimentalism
                        characterize the (emotional) body as a “feminine” realm, Blake
                        associates the <pb id="p39-63" n="63"/> female identity with material,
                        corporeal reality. As we shall see, although the female Emanations serve a
                        crucial role in the fallen world (as its very “ground,” as it
                        were), they are essentially anomalies and indicators of its fallenness. But,
                        as Helen P. Bruder also asserts, in “giving a form to sexual
                        error,” Blake was as much “a searching critic of
                        patriarchy” as a “hectoring misogynist” (182).<ref target="n10" type="note">10</ref> Although the female sex carries much
                        of the fallen world’s negative burden, the fallen male Zoas are by no

                        is inherently tied to their separate sexual identity <hi rend="i">as

                            poetics. For instance, Irene Tayler sheds a more positive light than
                            Damrosch on the gender equality of Blake’s Eternal androgyne,
                            while Anne K. Mellor and Susan Fox emphasize Blake’s
                            subordination of the female and the feminine.</note><note id="n9">9. For instance, Otto identifies Enitharmon as “the

                            Zoas’ loss,” as well as “the body of
                            imagination,” while Vala is “the sexual body” and

          <p>But how does the presence of two sexes in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>
                        indicate both that Blake recognized the sexual tensions fostered and
                        exploited by sentimental literature, and that he critiqued the sentimental
                        system as a whole? We can answer this question by first examining reactions
                        to sentimentalism, in particular the criticisms made by radical writers.
                        These writers decried the negative influence of sentimentalism on human
                        nature, an influence that they often traced back to the movement’s
                        conventional characters and behaviors. In turn, the harmful effects that
                        radical writers censured shed light on <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>
                        because they correspond in significant ways to Blake’s portrayal of
                        the fallen world and its sexually divided inhabitants.</p>
          <p>Despite its enduring presence, even by the 1770s
                        “sentimentality” was a derogatory label indicating
                        affectation, self-indulgence, and overbearing shows of emotion. Particularly
                        troubling for many was the feminized quality of sentimentalism, creating
                        hyper-feminine women and effeminate men and thus weakening society as a
                        whole. Sentimentalism’s fetishizing of the feminine created a
                        cultural dichotomy, with one group valuing the community-building power of
                        “female qualities” and another group fearing effeminacy,
                        advocating male dominance, and seeing woman’s nature as
                        “contingent” (Todd 20). The critics found feminine
                        “self-indulgent physicality and . . . self-contemplating
                        vanity” in sentimental literature as a whole (62); even worse, they
                        scorned it for adversely influencing readers—largely women.</p>
          <p>The revolutionary events of the 1790s ushered in a new group of critics <hi rend="i">and</hi> sentimentalists, with radical writers fighting for
                        social change and systemic reform rather than the indulgent cultivation of
                        feelings. According to Chris Jones, “Radical writers of sensibility
                        stressed qualities in direct contrast to the popular degenerate model of the
                        ‘man of feeling’ in emphasizing action and
                        intervention,” retaining an emphasis on the emotions but dismissing
                        “self-centred passions” for more <hi rend="i">universal</hi>
                        feelings under the aegis of rational benevolence (9). Because “the
                        whole [sentimental] movement had been branded with weakness and
                        irresponsibility” (17), it was both attacked and modified by
                        revolutionaries such as William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, as well as
                        later Romantics such as Jane Austen and William Wordsworth. As shown in <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> (1789), Blake absorbed the culture of
                        sentiment: his innocent speakers and pastoral lyrics, such as in “The
                        Lamb” and “Nurse’s Song,” depict a heartfelt
                        sympathy between individuals similar to the ideal of sentimentalism. Yet he
                        also critiqued sentimental culture, as in <hi rend="i">Visions of the
                            Daughters of Albion</hi> (1793) and <hi rend="i">Songs of
                            Experience</hi> (1794). In <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>, the main
                        characters both reflect and respond to sentimental stereotypes. We find the
                        sentimental triangle of (here emboldened) rape victim, tyrannical rapist,
                        and emotionally self-absorbed male in Oothoon, Bromion, and Theotormon. In
                            <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi>, Blake’s weeping chimney
                        sweeps (“The Chimney Sweeper”) or fussy infants
                        (“Infant Sorrow”), while pathetic images, confront a cold
                        society—typified in “The Human Abstract”—that
                        often professes sympathetic bonds but produces only a land of misery. These
                        works, along with some of his commercial book illustrations,<ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref> help to place Blake within the
                        cultural debate surrounding sentimentalism in the 1790s, even if he did not
                        follow some of his contemporaries and launch an explicit campaign for or
                        against the tradition. <note id="n11">11. Lincoln observes that Blake did
                            engravings for works by sentimental novelists such as Richardson,
                            Sterne, and Sarah Fielding (“Alluring” 630n30).</note></p>
          <p>Because Wollstonecraft attacks sentimental conventions while occasionally
                        incorporating them into her arguments, her <hi rend="i">Vindication of the
                            Rights of Men</hi> (1790) and <hi rend="i">Vindication of the Rights of
                            Woman</hi> (1792) provide excellent touchstones for the radical
                        reworking of sentimentalism and for Blake’s later critiques. As
                        Dennis Welch has pointed out, she likely had some influence on Blake, who
                        designed and engraved illustrations for her <hi rend="i">Original Stories
                            from Real Life</hi> (1788). And although Michael Ackland suggests that
                        Blake owed much to her <hi rend="i">Rights of Woman</hi> for his view of
                        sexual relationships and his attempts to create harmony between the sexes,
                        Ackland does not recognize some of the specific parallels between both of
                        the <hi rend="i">Vindications</hi> and Blake’s works.</p>
          <p>In the <hi rend="i">Rights of Men</hi>, Wollstonecraft upbraids Edmund Burke
                        for using “sentimental jargon, which has long been current in
                        conversation, and even in books of morals, though it never received the <hi rend="i">regal</hi> stamp of reason” “(62; all italics in
                        the original henceforth unless noted otherwise). She identifies this jargon
                        as an expression of blatant “<hi rend="i">sensibility</hi>,”
                        which she attacks for making men “resigned to their fate” and
                        unable “to labour to increase human happiness by extirpating error,
                        [which] is a manly godlike affection” (89). Sentimentalism values
                        “sympathetic emotion” and “mechanical instinctive
                        sensations” so much that it interferes with reason and active virtue.
                        Wollstonecraft also finds that sentimentalism has created a split between
                        and within the sexes, which has in turn corrupted society. Responding to the
                        excesses of sentiment in <pb id="p39-64" n="64"/> Burke’s <hi rend="i">Reflections</hi>, she ridicules this “good natured
                        man” for the “<hi rend="i">amiable</hi> weakness of his
                        mind” (81). But the man of feeling is only one male creature crawling
                        out of the sentimental swamp, for “mild affectionate sensibility only
                        renders a man more ingeniously cruel” (79), thus creating overly
                        malicious as well as overly weak men.</p>
          <p>In the <hi rend="i">Rights of Woman</hi>, Wollstonecraft especially laments
                        how women “become the prey of their senses, delicately termed
                        sensibility”—she calls them mere “creatures of
                        sensation”—as a result of “Novels, music, poetry, and
                        gallantry” (177). Just as men are made either weak or cruel by
                        sentimentalism, so women are made “either abject slaves or capricious
                        tyrants” (158). The latter exhibit “artificial
                        weakness” and have “a propensity to tyrannize” with
                        their “cunning” in order to “excite desire” in
                        men, who in their own right need to become “more chaste”
                        (113). But, deluded by sentimental notions of ideal feminine chastity, men
                        force women to be chaste and yet indulge themselves in novels,
                        “whilst men carry the same vitiated taste into life, and fly for
                        amusement to the wanton” after abandoning virtue (333). Clearly,
                        Wollstonecraft recognizes how “the reveries of the stupid
                        novelists” foster the debilitating “romantic twist of the
                        mind, which has been very properly termed <hi rend="i">sentimental</hi>” (330). But when she speaks of a poet or artist
                        “vibrating with each emotion” as he/she works (309) or makes
                        her own impassioned appeals to sensibility (rational here, more traditional
                        in her novels), it is hard not to see the continued influence of
                        sentimentalism even on this radical writer.</p>
          <p>Ackland is convincing, then, as he traces Blake’s “protracted
                        exploration of embattled sexuality” to Wollstonecraft (172), but he
                        misses the strong critique of sentimentalism in Wollstonecraft’s
                        treatises and in Blake’s poetry. Judith Lee comes much closer when
                        she points to Wollstonecraft’s <hi rend="i">Rights of Woman</hi>
                        “as a paradigm for [Blake’s] portrayal of women in an attempt
                        to resolve the contradictions between traditional stereotypes and his
                        revolutionary vision” (132). Sentimentalism is, I think, a key
                        concern in Blake’s writings because he addresses all of the major
                        problems that fellow radicals found in this movement: sexual tensions,
                        weakened or tyrannical men, victimized or manipulative women, and a system
                        of self-indulgent suffering. We can see such problems in <hi rend="i">The
                            Four Zoas</hi>, which treats contemporary social conditions in
                        cosmological, mythological, and psychological terms.<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> At the most basic thematic level, Albion’s
                        fragmentation into the four Zoas and their further fragmentation into
                        warring male and female identities point to what recent critics are
                        beginning to see as a consequence of sentimentalism. According to Marshall
                        Brown, “The sensible self is an unfathomable mystery,” whose
                        “Protean fragmentation” eighteenth-century writers treat at
                        great length (86). Because sentimentality “reduces self as well as
                        society to pure sentiment,” a “fragmentation of
                        personality” results “that forces us to adopt Sentimental
                        responses” and puts us at the mercy of our senses and emotions (Allen
                        128, 122). The fragmentation of the sentimental self is also related to the
                        divisions of the sexes in sentimental literature in a continual interplay of
                        cause and effect, making it nearly impossible to pinpoint one as cause or
                        effect. Similarly, for Blake, “sexual identity is the most defining
                        yet problematic aspect of selfhood” (Bruder 183), and Albion’s
                        self becomes both sexed and problematic with the fall. Blake’s
                        awareness of the sexual nature of selfhood helps us to answer our question
                        of how the two sexes in his mythology relate his work to sentimental
                        literature: the personalities and behaviors of Blake’s characters
                        often seem to exhibit some of the trademarks of sentimentalism. In turn, the
                        presence of sentimentality within the fallen world marks it as such, a sign
                        that the androgynous Eternal Self has divided into two separate, alienated
                        sexes. Blake’s starting point in the myth of fragmented Albion thus
                        projects the personal and social consequences of sentimentalism to a cosmic
                        level and defines them as concomitant with the fall. <note id="n12">12.
                            Marshall Brown argues that Blake “resolutely continued the vein
                            of sensibility,” struggling to “convert the psychic
                            economy of sensibility directly into a blinding vision of universal
                            truth” (103). I feel that Brown is a little too enthusiastic and
                            misses Blake’s evident criticisms of sentimentalism, as well as
                            the importance of the “psychic economy” evident in the
                            fourfold myth of the Zoas, which are interdependent—harmoniously
                            in Eternity and discordantly when fallen. Nevertheless, Brown’s
                            argument remains plausible in light of a letter that Blake wrote to his
                            patron William Hayley on 16 July 1804 (and so after his time at
                            Felpham). Thanking Hayley for some books, Blake writes, “[Samuel]
                            Richardson has won my heart I will again read Clarissa &amp;c they must
                            be admirable I was too hasty in my perusal of them to percieve all their
                            beauty” (E 754). Blake’s statement here seems to put him
                            entirely in sympathy with the sentimentality expressed (and codified) by
                            Richardson, which could make him less likely to criticize sentimentalism
                            in his writings. It also suggests that, despite engraving illustrations
                            for sentimental authors (and perhaps reading some of their works along
                            the way?), Blake actually read sentimental literature long after
                            beginning his poem <hi rend="i">Vala.</hi> But because of this relative
                            lateness, the majority of the poem itself still may be imbued with the
                            radical spirit and its critique of sentimentalism as both a literary and
                            a cultural phenomenon; later material, such as Night VIII, may be in
                            question. In addition, we should also consider Blake’s audience.
                            Blake’s positive comments on Richardson’s novels, sent by
                            Hayley with other books, may reflect his appreciation for
                            Hayley’s continuing support. This is not to charge Blake with
                            disingenuousness or to ignore his obviously favorable response, but I
                            think it is important to recognize that his opinions and views expressed
                            in letters may at times be complicated. Finally, Blake’s
                            sentiments here also may be part of his personal development that
                            culminated in a renewal of distinctly Christian vision in 1804, which he
                            recounts in a letter to Hayley on 23 October 1804 (E 756-57) and which
                            might make him more “susceptible” to the piety expressed
                            by Richardson’s heroines. Taking into account all of these
                            factors, I think that we must rely primarily on internal evidence from
                                <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> to gauge Blake’s views on
                            sentimentalism as they developed over the course of the poem’s
                            composition and revision.</note></p>
          <p>Indeed, the opening scene of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> resembles many
                        scenes in sentimental fiction. The action begins “with Tharmas Parent
                        power” pouring out a flood of sorrow: <q> Lost! Lost! Lost! are my

								<pb id="p39-66" n="66"/> Tharmas concludes his grief (temporarily) by
                        saying, “The Men have recieved their death wounds &amp; their
                        Emanations are fled / To me for refuge &amp; I cannot turn them out for
                        Pitys sake” (4:15-16, E 301). With his repetition of
                        “Pity” and his sense of victimization, it seems as if we are
                        meeting a true man of feeling. Moreover, Tharmas appears “Trembling
                        &amp; pale” as he sits “weeping in his clouds” (4:28,
                        E 301), which the illustration for page 5 depicts clearly enough (illus. 1;
                        note the presence of the water, perhaps a “sea of tears”?).
                        His debilitating “Despair” leads him to fear “self
                        murder” (4:37-38, E 302), as if his sympathy for the Emanations is so
                        strong that he cannot survive it. Tharmas’s ensuing inability to
                        act—which so often happens to a weakened, effeminate man of
                        feeling—occurs many times throughout the poem, as for example when he
                        argues with Los in Night IV and suffers an emotional chiasmus of tears,
                        wrath, pity (“with many a sigh”!), wrath again, and then more
                        tears (48:21-24, E 332). Since Tharmas is usually interpreted as the senses
                        and “the organizing principle of the self” (Damrosch 141), his
                        condition is a terrible and consistent indicator of the state of things in
                        Albion and in the poem.</p>
          <p>So here we have Tharmas, the sensory bedrock of humanity and the first male
                        character we meet in the fallen world, pouring out his sea of tears and
                        bewailing the pity that washes over him. And in the same opening scene,
                        Tharmas’s Emanation Enion responds affectively to his woe with her
                        equally troubled emotions. “Thy fear has made me tremble thy terrors
                        have surrounded me,” she says, and these terrors lead her to expect
                        (or resign herself to?) destruction: “I am almost Extinct &amp; soon
                        shall be a Shadow in Oblivion / Unless some way can be found that I may look
                        upon thee &amp; live” (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 4:17, 22-23, E 301).
                        This threatening loss of identity manifests the serious danger of excess
                        sentiment pointed out by Brown and Allen. Enion’s affective sympathy
                        for, and with, Tharmas is so complete that it puts her under the control of
                        her feelings, leaving her unable to maintain her sense of self against the
                        onrushing tide of his woe and fear. Although Enion cries out to him, he is
                        powerless to help her, completely divided and himself a victim of
                        humanity’s disorder. He can only turn “round the circle of
                        Destiny” before sinking “down into the sea a pale white corse
                        / In torment” and flowing “among [Enion’s] filmy
                        Woof” (5:11, 13-14, E 302). The direct result of this dissolution is
                        even more tragic: the Spectre of Tharmas (“insane &amp; most /
                        Deformd” [5:38-39, E 303]) is born from his corpse and is clothed by
                        Enion’s <hi rend="i">laboring</hi> for “Nine days” and
                        “nine dark sleepless nights” at her loom (5:23, E 302). In his
                        spectrous form, Tharmas becomes a tyrannical male, “pure” and
                        “Exalted in terrific Pride,” while describing Enion as a
                        “Diminutive husk &amp; shell” and as “polluted”
                        (6:8-10, E 303). As with so many persecuted heroines of sentimental fiction,
                        her pollution does not dissuade him from “Mingling his horrible
                        brightness with her tender limbs,” a rape that in turn transforms her
                        into “a bright wonder that Nature shudder’d at / Half Woman
                        &amp; half Spectre” (7:8-10, E 304)—and then into a
                        mother.</p>
          <p>This first scene of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> incorporates three of the
                        most prominent sentimental stereotypes: the weakened man of feeling, the
                        abused woman driven to destruction, and the brutally abusive male, a cast
                        hearkening back to that of <hi rend="i">Visions.</hi> One example of a
                        comparable interaction between such types appears in Mackenzie’s <hi rend="i">The Man of Feeling</hi>, which shows that these gender
                        stereotypes are both sentimental in nature and part of a sentimental
                        exchange system.<ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref> The scene in question
                        occurs when Miss Atkins, a prostitute, narrates her woeful tale to the hero,
                        Harley. In this sentimental economy, the price of goods is paid with tears,
                        so Harley dutifully weeps himself to the point of being dumb, which in turn
                        causes Miss Atkins’s “fortitude . . . to fail at the
                        sight” (Mackenzie 50). Although the bartering begins with the woman
                        here, the affective exchange of a sad story and subsequent emotional
                        responses is similar to that in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>:
                        Tharmas’s lament, Enion’s fearful answer, and Tharmas’s
                        dissolution into Enion’s woof. When Miss Atkins’s father
                        bursts into the room and explodes with rage over the lost honor of his
                        daughter, we see the sort of antagonistic male that Blake transforms into
                        the Spectre of Tharmas. Miss Atkins, having established her status as victim
                        in her tale, faces further hardship as she falls “prostrate at [her
                        father’s] feet” and <hi rend="i">begs</hi> him for “the
                        death she deserves.” Unlike Blake’s Spectre, however, Miss
                        Atkins’s father “burst[s] into tears” and does not
                        punish (or rape!) her. Matters end happily when even this hostile male
                        “[mingles] his tears with hers” (51). Despite the different
                        endings—an exemplary sentimental encounter in the novel versus a
                        critical representation of sentimentalism’s dark side in the
                        poem—both Mackenzie and Blake depict how characters influence each
                        other through an exchange of sentiment, and both do so by using three
                        sentimental stereotypes. <note id="n13">13. According to Barker-Benfield,
                            Smith’s social-exchange sentimentalism provided a major source
                            for Mackenzie: “Mackenzie lived in the Edinburgh of Hume and
                            Smith and his novels preached the latter’s theory of moral
                            sentiments” (142).</note></p>
          <p>Perhaps an even more striking instance of sentimental
                        “exchange” between characters in <hi rend="i">The Four
                            Zoas</hi> comes at the end of Night II. This scene opens with Los and
                        Enitharmon sowing contention between Urizen and Ahania as Enion laments and
                        Urizen—having already puffed himself up as “God the terrible
                        destroyer &amp; not the Saviour”—watches helplessly in dread
                            (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 12:26, E 307). Los begins with a self-pitying
                        account of being “forsaken” and “mockd” by the
                        very lowest creatures in nature (34:21, E 323). Less than sympathetic,
                        Enitharmon calls him her “slave,” paradoxically
                        “strong” while she is “weak” (34:46, E 323).
                        Because Los had earlier abused Enitharmon and then repented out of pity for
                        her suffering (11:3, E 306; 12:40-43, E 307), his subsequent
                        “enslavement” to her shows a remarkable parallel to
                        Wollstonecraft’s point about apparently weak, sentimental women often
                        being made tyrants by male oppression. Los has certainly fallen under
                        Enitharmon’s newfound power, for he can only languish “in deep
                        sobs . . . till dead he also fell” when she deserts him (34:54, E
                        323). Blake accentuates the <pb id="p39-67" n="67"/> cunning nature of her
                        control, labeling her song of exaltation over Los’s grief a
                        “Rapturous delusive trance” produced by her delight at having
                        power over Los and other men (34:93, E 324). Responsive to his
                        counterpart’s rising emotions, Los revives through the song and finds
                        sufficient energy to drive Enion and Ahania (her female rivals?)
                        “into the deathful infinite” (34:97, E 324). This situation
                        exemplifies what Wollstonecraft so zealously argues, that sentimentality
                        pushes the sexes apart and fosters a system of emotional manipulation and
                        physical cruelty based on their gender differences.</p>
          <p>In this same scene, Enion utters her famous “Experience” lament
                        and paints a series of pathetic pictures such as “the dog . . . at
                        the wintry door, the ox in the slaughter house” and “the
                        captive in chains &amp; the poor in the prison, &amp; the soldier

                        are all sufferers whom she identifies and sympathizes with, in contrast to
                        those who rejoice in and ignore the misery. The affective power of
                        Enion’s song is clear, for Ahania hears and, as if haunted by the
                        images in Enion’s lament, “never from that moment could . . .
                        rest upon her pillow” (36:19, E 326). But when Ahania comes to Urizen
                        in the opening of Night III, it seems that Enion’s weakness (she
                        sings from “the margin of Non Entity” [36:17, E 326]) has also
                        affected her: Ahania subjects herself before Urizen’s throne,
                        pleading with her male counterpart in vain (illus. 2). While the sentimental
                        imagery employed by the Emanations in their songs is worth noting, more
                        important is the way in which the characters affect each other with that
                        imagery. Los cries and dies, Enitharmon sings in pride and

						revives him, Enion wails over Los’s antagonism, and Ahania
                        is moved to seek her counterpart in meekness. Much as he does in Night I,
                        when Tharmas melts into Enion’s woof and is immediately reborn as his
                        own antithesis (the hypocritical rapist Spectre), Blake here problematizes
                        our sympathetic identification with these characters, which is likely to be
                        our first reaction. Forced to question our emotional, heartfelt response, we
                        may also begin to question the validity of all such responses and their
                        causes. Further, Blake shows just how complicit each type of character is in
                        the suffering of the others, how they actually transform <hi rend="i">into</hi> each other, and how they instigate each other’s
                        actions. The sentimental system of affective responsiveness is not only a
                        system of exploitation, but also a system to be exploited for selfish ends
                        rather than benevolent community building. And, as we saw above, the
                        novelist’s system of suffering feeds itself: just as every Clarissa
                        needs a Lovelace to threaten (and thus make manifest) her pathetic heroism,
                        so every Oothoon needs a Bromion and every Enion needs a Spectre of
                        Tharmas.</p>
          <p>In <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, sentimentalism is not only problematic
                        because of its fracturing, exploitative tendencies; it is also consistently
                        negative because of the “feminine” or
                        “feminizing” qualities that many eighteenth-century critics
                        decried. Fallen life is, in many ways, “sentimental” for Blake
                        because

						“it is inseparable from the world of Generation, of mothers
                        and weeping babies, of the matter and substance which are supposed to be
                        nonentity but in fact seem all too real” (Damrosch 170). Mothers and
                        weeping babies are the stock in trade of sentimentalism, prototypically weak
                        creatures that so easily provoke affective responses. Thus, Blake
                        consistently associates sentimental images of birth, children, the family,
                        and nature with “vegetating” and the continual fall from
                        Eternity. The birth of Los and Enitharmon after Enion’s rape in Night
                        I is ostensibly a moment of potential happiness. Indeed, the illustration on
                        page 8 (illus. 3) depicts a rather beautiful image of two tiny babes
                        suckling their smiling mother’s breasts. But the text makes clear
                        that these babes are the physical manifestations of Enion’s
                        “sorrow &amp; woe” (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 8:1, E 304). They
                        exploit her “drooping mothers pity” and, “in pride and
                        haughty joy,” they draw her “Into Non Entity” as she
                        gives “them all her spectrous life” (8:7-9:8, E 304), a
                        situation depicted in the very next illustration (illus. 4).<ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref> In addition, Enitharmon’s song
                            <pb id="p39-70" n="70"/> over the dead Los in Night II includes images
                        of nature and the “weeping babe,” and when she exclaims,
                        “For every thing that lives is holy,” the context throws a
                        remarkably negative light on this famous Blakean assertion (34:81, 34:80, E
                            324).<ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref> As Enitharmon sings of her
                        new power and her desire for control, following as it does the problematic
                        portrayal of her and Los’s birth, it is hard to join in and exclaim
                        that physical life is indeed “holy.” <note id="n14">14. Blake
                            washed a passage from this scene that more closely associates the birth
                            of the children with animal and vegetable life, all of which relate to
                            the verb “vegetate” (see E 823-24). Although likely
                            meaning to cancel this passage, Blake associates physical birth with
                            “vegetating” elsewhere, such as with the “vegetated
                            body” (104:37, E 378).</note><note id="n15">15. This assertion is used much more positively at the close
                            of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> (plate 27, E 45),
                            in <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> (8:10, E 51),
                            and in <hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi> (8:13, E 54).</note></p>
          <p>The birth of Orc in Night V is particularly troubling in this respect. In
                        reaction to Orc’s too-close relationship with his mother Enitharmon,
                        Los the father “bound down her loved Joy” with “the
                        chain of Jealousy” out of “Love of Parent Storgous Appetite
                        Craving” (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 60:22-61:10, E 341). However, both
                        parents suffer “all the sorrow Parents feel” and return in
                        vain to free their son; even the narrator is overcome, only capable of
                        making a trademark sentimental comment to the reader: “all their
                        lamentations / I write not here but all their after life was
                        lamentation” (62:10, E 342; 63:8-9, E 343). Once again, Blake makes
                        it impossible for us to feel true sympathy for his characters. As in
                        “Infant Sorrow,” we react negatively to these parents because
                        of their complicity in their bound child’s suffering; nor can we
                        fully sympathize with the child Orc, since birth itself is suspect as a
                        continual fragmentation of fragments. Rather than encourage our sympathy
                        with parents or child, Blake exploits sentimental conventions in order to
                        call them into question, here with babes and weeping parents as
                        representations of the <hi rend="i">basis</hi> of sentimentality, the
                        physical or “vegetated” body itself.<ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref><note id="n16">16. The problematic nature of childbirth in a world of
                            systematized sexuality is an enduring concern for Blake. David Aers
                            notes that, in <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>, “The activity of
                            begetting children is . . . engulfed in [a] closed world and the
                            infant’s sexual life is doomed [in the] ghastly circle of
                            ‘The Mental Traveller’” (“Blake: Sex,
                            Society and Ideology” 30).</note></p>
          <p>When in Night II Blake describes how “Luvah was cast into the Furnaces
                        of affliction &amp; sealed” while “Vala fed in cruel delight,
                        the furnaces with fire” (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 25:40-41, E 317), he
                        shows how the war between the fallen sexes is itself the reason why birth in
                        the fallen world is vegetative and deformative.<ref target="n17" type="note">17</ref> Once again, we can see here the sentimental system at work,
                        with a male subjected to a cruel, cunning female whom he himself
                        “nurturd” and “fed . . . with my rains &amp;
                        dews” until she mutated from an “Earth-worm” to
                        “A scaled Serpent” to “a Dragon” to “a
                        little weeping Infant” (26:7-27:2, E 317). Although this male figure
                        pities a smaller, fragile creature (the worm), his actions are part of a
                        system that transforms pitiable and sentimental objects into deadly dragons.
                        Indeed, his complicity is obvious (albeit not to him), for he proudly calls
                        himself the “King” of the female as he narrates her
                        metamorphosis (26:5, E 317). The sexual symbolism and tension in this
                        passage are powerful, becoming almost disturbing in the illustration of
                        deformed sexual creatures accompanying it (illus. 5).<ref target="n18" type="note">18</ref> Blake also presents a situation that Wollstonecraft
                        describes in her attack on sentimental literature: male oppression,
                        especially in the form of improper education and reading, produces conniving
                        women who exploit male desire so as to gain power. Blake, however,
                        articulates this argument in nightmare images. The females in Blake’s
                        fallen world are, like Wollstonecraft’s, most often either helpless
                        or deceitful, while the males are weak, hypocritical, or cruel. Despite
                        sentimental sympathies, there is no true harmony. <note id="n17">17.
                            “Infant Sorrow” is again a helpful parallel, exemplifying
                            how tensions between parents are directly “reborn” in
                            their offspring.</note><note id="n18">18. In this series of designs from manuscript p. 26, perhaps
                            the most famous and most reproduced, we can see breasts on the top

                            and a vagina in the next figure. Many other illustrations to the poem,
                            especially in Nights II and III, are even more dramatically
                            representative of the sexual strife that characterizes the fallen world.
                            These accompanying designs, with their various bodiless and fetishized
                            genitalia or their startling acts of copulation, only manifest and
                            intensify the fighting, frustrations, and entrapments that occur between
                            characters in the text.</note></p>
          <p>I have spoken of sentimentalism and its sexual strife as a negative, even
                        predatory “system” in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> because
                        I think that Blake compels us to see it in this way. Although characters of
                        both sexes are guilty of powermongering, sentimentalism by Blake’s
                        time is closely aligned with femininity. But Blake will not let us forget
                        that pity and sentimentality have also become bound up in a social
                        “law” operating under the moral law of Urizen, fallen reason.
                        The social exchanges of Adam Smith and “bartering” with tears
                        in <hi rend="i">The Man of Feeling</hi> are only two examples of what Blake
                        seems to recognize. Even worse, in fallen life, the Pity that has “a
                        human face” too easily becomes the hypocritical Pity that
                        “would be no more / If we did not make somebody Poor”
                        (“The Divine Image” 18:10, E 12; “The Human
                        Abstract” 47:1-2, E 27). Sympathy degenerates into a source of
                        control, not of affection.</p>
          <p>This law of sentimentality appears most explicitly in <hi rend="i">The Four
                            Zoas</hi> during Urizen’s travels in Nights VI and VII. In Night
                        VI, the tyrannical Urizen at one moment looks like a sympathetic character,
                        “Writing in bitter tears &amp; groans,” except that he writes
                        “in books of iron &amp; brass” containing his laws of moral
                        virtue (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 70:3, E 347). (It is inviting to see
                        Urizen’s tears and groans as part of what he writes, as if he were
                        truly codifying laws of sentimentality like one of Wollstonecraft’s
                        “stupid novelists.”) While doing so, he views “The
                        ruind spirits once his children &amp; the children of Luvah” in the
                        Abyss (70:6, E 347). In what follows, Blake again sets up a sentimental
                        tableau only to undercut it quickly. As if fed by Urizen’s woe, each
                        soul in the Abyss “partakes of [another’s] dire woes &amp;
                        mutual returns the pang” (70:16, E 347). Despite these affective
                        responses, which would potentially ease the terrors of the void, the
                        ultimate response is the outbreak of war! When Urizen later comes upon Orc
                        and expresses sympathy, the chained boy calls his bluff: “Curse thy
                        hoary brows. What dost thou in this deep / Thy Pity I contemn scatter thy
                        snows elsewhere” (78:42-43, E 354). But Urizen is persistent,

                        (Orc), the “Moral Duty” (80:3, E 355) that this lawgiver
                        expounds includes rules for manipulating the powerless and poor with false
                        shows of emotion until they are “as spaniels . . . taught with
                        art” (80:9-21, E 355). “Spaniels” could apply equally
                        to men of feeling and to helpless female victims in the “art”
                        “art” of sentimental literature. What is most interesting here
                        is that Urizen’s laws, his freezing “snows” of pity,
                        are the very same as Ahania’s “laws of obedience &amp;
                        insincerity,” which Urizen abhorred in Night III (43:10-11, E 329).
                        However, to be more accurate, Ahania’s laws are in fact
                        Urizen’s laws, since she is his feminine portion now separated from
                        him. Thus, when she confronted him in Night III with his own sublimated
                        laws, hoisting him on his own (phallic) petard, he reacted with typical
                        violence by throwing her “from his bosom” and “far into
                        Non Entity” (43:24-44:5, E 329).<ref target="n19" type="note">19</ref> Again we find the fragmented self and the sexes caught in a
                        sort of whirlpool of origins and causality. <note id="n19">19. See Otto on
                            the significance of the phallus in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> and
                            its relation to Urizen’s religion/law.</note></p>
          <p>For Blake, all systems and laws, especially of morality and human behavior,
                        are threads in the web of Urizen and are thus dangerous. This is
                        particularly true of sentimentalism because, as Urizen’s lesson to
                        Orc in Night VII makes clear, affect can be manipulated for tyrannical ends
                        far too effectively. The “sexual code” of sentimental law is
                        also troubling in relation to <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, since it
                        inculcated self-repressive “delicacy” even while praising
                        natural responses and maintaining an intimate association between that
                        virtue and sensual desire (Barker-Benfield 299; Hagstrum, <hi rend="i">Sex
                            and Sensibility</hi> 75). But sentimentalism is even more craven and
                        harmful when one engages in its practices for the wrong reasons. The case of
                        Los in Night IV illustrates this point. Los and Tharmas confront each other,
                        each recounting his tale of woe and pity at the separations that have
                        occurred, and then Tharmas bids Los to build the universe—that is, to
                        give Urizen a <hi rend="i">physical body.</hi> Completing his task in seven
                        ages of woe, Los sees the form that he has created and, “terrifid at
                        the shapes / Enslavd humanity put on <hi rend="i">he became what he
                            beheld</hi> / He became what he was doing he was himself
                        transformd” (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 55:21-23, E 338; my italics).
                        Through Los’s calamity, Blake presents the ultimate danger of trying
                        to “enter into” another along the lines expounded by
                        sentimentalists, who based the act on a sympathetic reaction to another
                        individual’s worldly, visible hardship and, in the case of Smith,
                        connected it with social standing.<ref target="n20" type="note">20</ref>
                        Because Los reacts to Urizen’s <hi rend="i">physical</hi> shape as it
                        forms before him, he cannot penetrate the suffering, pathetic body, and so
                        he gets trapped by the superficial. To become what one beholds in this way
                        “defines a lapse of imagination. It is a romantic figure of <hi rend="i">visionary</hi> catastrophe” (McGann 66; my italics), so
                        Los actually loses his vision and gets transfixed by pity and fear—he
                        himself becomes an object of physical suffering. Blake shows the
                        impossibility of Smith’s sentimental “entering into”
                        another by making Los a failed visionary, doomed by his own sympathy and
                        infected by the object of his pity. In terms of sentimentalism, this would
                        correspond to acting out of sympathetic benevolence but not looking deeper
                        into the causes of such suffering, an error that, Blake implies, drags the
                        sympathizer farther into the miserable (fallen) system. That is, it is
                        ineffective and essentially self-indulgent sympathy, emotion for its own
                        sake. For Blake, as we shall see, Los’s (physical rather than
                        visionary) response also corresponds to pitying the
                        “vegetated” body of error that suffers rather than the
                        spiritual individual within.<ref target="n21" type="note">21</ref><note id="n20">20. Stephen Cox calls Smith’s <hi rend="i">Theory of

                            them” (67).</note><note id="n21">21. It is worth noting briefly here that the truly <hi rend="i">visionary</hi> “entering into” others that
                            Los does and advocates in Blake’s later epic <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> reflects the central, heroic role that he gained in
                            Blake’s mythology from the minor Prophecies and <hi rend="i">The
                                Four Zoas</hi> to <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> Los seems to have learned much between the
                            epics.</note></p>
          <p>Although sentimentality in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> is a telltale sign
                        of fallenness, Blake’s attitude at times seems ambivalent, and he is
                        not wholly committed to exposing it as a Urizenic corruption. The deciding
                        factor is how it is used. Further, the connection of sentimentality to the
                        female Emanations does not automatically lead Blake to reject <hi rend="i">all</hi> forms of sentiment as pernicious. Ahania and Enion play
                        crucial roles in the epic’s push toward regeneration precisely <hi rend="i">because</hi> of their emotional, affective, and sympathetic
                        natures (in contrast to Enitharmon and Vala, the manipulative females). They
                        are truly the most consistent voices calling for unity, while the males only
                        remind them of their emanated being, wallow in helpless self-pity, or lash
                        out in destructive wrath and war. Although these Emanations are raped,
                        beaten, and driven to non-existence for their efforts, they are like a
                        sentimental “glue” that keeps Albion’s fragments from
                        separating completely. Along with the song of Enion discussed above and her
                        first speech in Night I, in which she laments her separation from Tharmas,
                        Ahania’s speech to Urizen in the opening of Night III is significant.
                        Indeed, Ahania is the first character to speak of the “Eternal
                        Brotherhood” that has been lost, and she begs Urizen to
                        “Listen to her who loves thee lest we also are driven away”
                            (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 41:9, E 328; 42:8, E 328). Urizen, of course, will
                        have none of this, so her appeal gets her promptly cast into Non Entity.
                        Nevertheless, as the chaos within Albion grows ever more perilous, Ahania
                        and Enion lurk in the shadows as reminders of the real reason for the
                        suffering that every character endures.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, Ahania and Enion have positive roles by virtue of their
                        relation to nature and the fallen world. While this relationship reflects
                        the social (and sentimental) view associating the emotions and the physical
                        body with femininity, McGann points out that “the destructive nature
                        of nature” is also part of the Christian tradition Blake writes
                        within (151). As a result, nature has a “redemptive
                        mechanism”—hence the incarnation, <pb id="p39-73" n="73"/> the
                        belief that the spiritual/divine is born through the corporeal body in order
                        to redeem it. In this respect, even Enitharmon and Vala (including her most
                        fallen forms, Rahab and Tirzah) are “positive” or
                        “redemptive.” As Ackland notes, Enitharmon’s
                        “realm is nature, and nature remains part of the Divine
                        Humanity”; even “the triumph of Vala [in Night VIII; see
                        below] can serve paradoxically as a prelude to apocalypse, for any
                        consolidation of error makes it more readily identifiable and
                        remediable” (180). The feminine realm of corporeality, physical
                        emotion, and sentiment is, like the fallen body of Albion that it comprises,
                        potentially redeemable, a stage (or even an early form of a Blakean
                        “State”) in the regenerative process.</p>
          <p>While McGann and Ackland are both correct in identifying the positive
                        function of the females and nature in Blake’s myth, Ackland in
                        particular is too prone to stress their “redemptive role” and
                        to miss the larger point that Blake makes with his use of Emanations and a
                        gendered, generative nature. Although he wrote poems like “On
                        Anothers Sorrow” and chided a cold, unfeeling culture, Blake was
                        equally aware that “Innocence” in the world is the state of
                        childhood, not of Eternity. Consequently, fallen existence is a reality, but
                        it is <hi rend="i">not</hi> a positive reality; it is a trap, a slumber or
                        death of Albion and every individual that must be overcome for a return to
                        Eternity. Again, it is all too easy in a fallen world to “become what
                        one beholds,” to see one’s vegetative body as the real body,
                        and to remain “dead.” In a society practicing the <hi rend="i">art</hi> of sentiment, this lapse of spiritual vision becomes even
                        easier. Thus, sentimental pity and benevolence, however positive they may be
                        in ameliorating fallen hardship, are not enough for regeneration in
                        Blake’s works. For him, regeneration (poetic, personal, and
                        universal) requires <hi rend="i">inspired</hi> vision, which the weakening
                        and exploitative tendencies of sentimentalism, along with its reification of
                        the physical or natural, prevent. Social misery does gain Blake’s
                        critical attention, but, as Martin Price comments, “Blake is less
                        concerned with exposing injustice than with finding a vital response to
                        it” (401). In the examples I have discussed from <hi rend="i">The
                            Four Zoas</hi> thus far, Blake has certainly exposed the problems
                        inherent in a system of sentiment, its part in the battle between the sexes,
                        and its use as a tool for oppression. And Ahania and Enion’s positive
                        sentimentality does not solve these problems, for it too is a product of the
                        fall; thus, they can only propose “facile modifications rather than
                        fundamental changes either in the behavior of the zoas or in their own
                        behavior” (Lee 134). The question, then, is how to move beyond the
                        sentimental world all together.</p>
          <p>We can answer this question by looking at the first step taken toward
                        Eternity in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> This moment comes with the
                        embrace of Los and the Spectre of Urthona in the conclusion of Night VIIa.
                        Although Blake’s incorporation of this material late in the
                        composition process creates many bibliographic, textual, and narrative
                        challenges, the scene is important here because it serves as a re-vision, in
                        both its success and its failure, of the sentimentality expressed thus far
                        in the poem. At this point in the plot, an unprecedented event occurs after
                        a vivid series of splits and unions and outbursts of the dead: <q> But then

                        precipitate this embrace, much as Los’s pity and tears do. The key,
                        however, is that Los embraces the Spectre “as another Self,”
                        perhaps implying that he sees the Spectre as a being who shares an intimate
                        bond with him, not as an <hi rend="i">object</hi> or <hi rend="i">other</hi>

                        the Spectre speaks as a Spectre, calling himself Los’s “real

                        life” (86:2, E 368). Los responds furiously that he feels “a
                        World within / Opening its gates,” and he bids the Spectre to enter
                        his bosom <hi rend="i">with Enitharmon</hi> to learn “Peace”
                        and “repentance to Cruelty” (86:7-12, E 368). For the first
                        time, a male character urges action that is redemptive and
                        regenerative—and not out of simple pity, for himself or for another,
                        but because of something stronger “within.” <note id="n23">23.
                            As Dennis Welch points out to me, the meaning of “another
                            Self” is highly ambiguous here—is the Spectre an other
                            self or an aspect of Los’s self? The implication of
                            “humanizing” may also be important if we think of
                            Albion’s status as the “Universal Humanity,” so
                            that Los may be becoming eternally human rather than physically human;
                            compare Tharmas in Night IX (132:36ff., E 401). These instances of
                            ambiguity (so characteristic of Blake), along with the lateness of this
                            added passage, may help to explain why the embrace fails to initiate
                            regeneration directly.</note></p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the reunion of this fragmented fragment is incomplete because
                        (at least in part) “Enitharmon trembling fled &amp; hid beneath
                        Urizens tree” (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 87:1, E 368). After she plays the
                        Eve to Los’s Adam and tempts him to eat the fruit of the Tree of
                        Mystery, all three of the characters fall into helpless self-blame for the
                        fall. But this is still a momentous occasion because Los experiences a
                        renewal, however fleeting, of vision. Continuing with his intimations of a
                        “World within,” he sees Enitharmon “like a shadow
                        withering / As on the outside of Existence” and tells her to
                        “look! behold! take comfort! / Turn inwardly thine Eyes &amp; there
                        behold the Lamb of God / Clothed in Luvahs robes of blood descending to
                        redeem” (87:41-44, E 369). The rest of this scene wavers between
                        positive and negative action, the latter most evident in Enitharmon’s
                        fear of the Lamb of God and her desire to use the spectres of the dead as
                        “ransoms” (98 [90]:24, E 370). But, after the ambiguous
                        refusal of Los and Enitharmon to sacrifice their children (discussed below),
                        Los draws Urizen out of the war raging around <pb id="p39-74" n="74"/> them
                        and feels “love &amp; not hate,” beholding Urizen as
                        “an infant” in his hands (98 [90]:65-66, E 371). Los is now
                        able to envision the regenerated Urizen, to perceive the spiritual body
                        within the hoary old man who has been stirring up universal antagonism,
                        rather than the mere corporeal form.</p>
          <p>What this scene indicates is that sentimental sympathy is essentially
                        stagnant without Blakean vision. When Los appropriates sentimental qualities
                        like pity, benevolence, and a desire for reunion with his suffering
                        counterparts, he does so on the basis of his vision of “the Lamb of
                        God” within every individual, not just because those counterparts are
                        miserable. He sees their shared error and the need to rectify it. His
                        visionary moment may be fleeting, but it is truly the first indicator of a
                        potential regeneration to come. Blake’s use in this scene of the same
                        sentimental conventions and discourse that have caused so much trouble in
                        the earlier Nights serves to revitalize them, for they are now a part of
                        vision, inspiration, and prophecy—they introduce hope into a world
                        that is still fallen and at war.</p>
          <p>Because Los’s moment of vision in Night VIIa is powerful for the light
                        of hope it brings into <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, it seems fitting and
                        yet troubling that the next Night opens with the creation of Albion’s
                        fallen body and the descent of “the Lamb of God clothed in Luvahs
                        robes,” i.e., Jesus the Savior in physical form (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi>
                        101:1, E 373). The first moment of redemptive vision by Los the Eternal
                        Prophet serves as a catalyst, as it were, for the final consolidation of
                        error. Although Los can “behold the Divine Vision thro the broken
                        Gates / Of [Enitharmon’s] poor broken heart,” and Enitharmon
                        can “see the Lamb of God upon Mount Zion,” Urizen can only see
                        his enemy Luvah and gather forces for more war (99:15-17, E 372).<ref target="n24" type="note">24</ref> Jesus comes as the “pitying
                        one” to “Assume the dark Satanic body” and to give
                        Albion “his vegetated body / [which is] To be cut off &amp;
                        separated [so] that the Spiritual body may be Reveald” (104:14, E
                        377; 104:13, E 377; 104:37-38, E 378), but this can only occur when human
                        existence has reached its nadir. In other words, Jesus must suffer
                        crucifixion by the forces of Mystery or Rahab, who is both a degenerated
                        form of Vala (the “Dragon” that Luvah nurtured and the
                        exemplar of a female tyrant) and the “Fruit of Urizens tree”
                        (109 [105]:20, E 378). This crucifixion is “the triumph of
                        Vala” (Ackland 180) and the final consolidation of error, the dead
                        body of Jesus providing the most visible form of error possible. <note id="n24">24. It seems significant here that Los beholds the divine
                            vision <hi rend="i">through</hi> Enitharmon’s heart, again
                            intimating that he has gained the vision necessary to see into the
                            physical body to find the spiritual body within—and to see <hi rend="i">through</hi> that body to the divine. Enitharmon, on the
                            other hand, sees the Lamb of God as external, outside herself (and
                            others) at this point; only after weaving bodies for the spectres into
                            “the Female Jerusa[le]m the holy” can she see “the
                            Lamb of God within Jerusalems Veil” (104:1-2, E 376).</note></p>
          <p>Arguably, the crucifixion also largely results from the hypocritical system
                        of sentiment (moral law) that Rahab practices and Urizen inspires. The song
                        of the Females of Amalek, Rahab’s daughters, evidences Rahab and
                        Urizen’s hypocritical sentimentality at its most obvious, which seems
                        fitting in the context of this Night. “O thou poor human form O thou
                        poor child of woe / Why dost thou wander away from Tirzah why me compell to
                        bind thee,” the Females of Amalek sing over their bound victims,
                        terrifying them with knives <hi rend="i">and</hi> tears (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 109 [105]:31-32, E 378). Their song eerily recalls
                        Enion’s song in Night II, which makes the image of demonic,
                        knife-wielding singers even more startling; it also heightens our awareness
                        of how crocodile tears of pity can be frightfully hard to distinguish from
                        true tears. Blake later punctuates this ambiguity, making such crocodile
                        tears truly degenerative when Urizen’s pity for, and embrace of, the
                        Shadowy Female causes him to mutate into a scaly monster (106:22ff., E 381;
                        illustrated on page 70 of the manuscript).</p>
          <p>Blake problematizes sentimentality once again, here in the form that the
                        Females of Amalek give it, by directly following the song (as if the two
                        were causally related) with the crucifixion of the Lamb of God on the Tree
                        of Mystery, the tree of Rahab and Urizen (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 110
                        [106]:1-3, E 379). The sight is catastrophic, leaving even the newly
                        inspired Los “despairing of Life Eternal” while Rahab glories
                        “in Delusive feminine pomp questioning him” (110 [106]:16, E
                        379; 105 [113]:43, E 380). But Los struggles through his despair and
                        persists in advocating self-recognition and repentance even to Rahab,
                        speaking to her “with tenderness &amp; love not uninspird”
                        (105 [113]:44, E 380). His inspiration leads him to pity her <hi rend="i">for her error</hi>, an error that he himself shares but can now work to
                        rectify (105 [113]:51-52, E 380). Although Rahab refuses to heed his words,
                        his hope remains. And later, when Ahania cries out at the death around her,
                        Enion seems to draw on Los’s hope as she comforts Ahania, her fellow
                        sufferer, with a prophecy of the universal return to “ancient
                        bliss” (114 [110]:28, E 385).</p>
          <p>These positive threads woven into the vegetated fabric of Night VIII are,
                        with the hypocritical and negative threads, all tied to sentimentalism, with
                        Los’s tear shed for Rahab’s stubborn persistence in error and
                        Enion’s sympathy for her companion in misery. But the proliferation
                        of the word “vision” in these events further emphasizes the
                        change that has occurred in that sentimentalism.
                        “Sentimentality,” as it is now practiced by Los the inspired
                        prophet, has in fact been remade into “vision” by being taken
                        to a spiritual level, by piercing the vegetated body in order to sympathize
                        with and work to redeem the trapped spiritual body.<ref target="n25" type="note">25</ref> But the vegetated body remains, and the vegetated
                        things in the natural world that serve as the objects of systematized
                        sentiment have to be burned <pb id="p39-75" n="75"/> away like the error
                        that they manifest. There has to be a Last Judgment. Thus, as Night IX
                        opens, Jesus stands over Los and Enitharmon and separates “Their
                        Spirit from their body” (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 117:4, E 386).<ref target="n26" type="note">26</ref> This separation seems to liberate and
                        inspire Los anew, for he initiates the Last Judgment by tearing down the sun
                        and moon, “cracking the heavens” so that the “fires of
                        Eternity” can spread over the material universe and consume the error
                        that has been given final form via the crucifixion (117:9-10, E 386). <note id="n25">25. This emphasis on “vision” in Night VIII
                            combines with Blake’s increased, and to some extent disjunctive,
                            focus on Jesus “the pitying one” in this Night to help
                            reveal Blake’s attitudes towards sentimentalism that his July
                            1804 letter to Hayley makes even more problematic. Blake’s
                            renewed Christian vision/faith seems to make him more convinced of the
                            need for forgiveness of sins and pity for sinners, but this forgiveness
                            and pity must be <hi rend="i">spiritual</hi> acts born from a
                            recognition of “the Lamb of God” within each
                            person.</note><note id="n26">26. The fact that Jesus then disappears as an agent in Night
                            IX, both in the text and in the drawings (he appears once, on p. 129,
                            while Blake presents him in four large drawings in Night VIII), is
                            significant, from an interpretational perspective, in light of what is
                            to come. It is as if the blood and gore of Blake’s Last Judgment
                            cannot directly incorporate the presence of the “pitying
                            one,” however much the divine hand may be guiding what occurs.
                            From a bibliographic perspective, this change of Jesus from visible
                            victim/savior to a <hi rend="i">deus absconditus</hi> also seems to
                            support Bentley when he gives the current Night VIII a later date than
                            the greater part of Night IX (164-66); such a late date would make the
                            centrality of Jesus in Night VIII a reflection of the increasing
                            Christian focus in Blake’s later writings (as in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>).</note></p>
          <p>Blake’s apocalypse is almost beautifully frightful in its violence,
                        far surpassing his source in Revelation and implying just how powerful error
                        is to him. His own prophetic wrath is unmistakable, and he often seems
                        deliberately to target the figures that sentimentalism reified and realized
                        in its culture. While Blake gives victims such as slaves, prisoners, and
                        suffering families the chance to torment their oppressors in the opening
                        melee (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 122:38-123:32, E 392-93), even these victims, as
                        vestiges of fallen human life and objects of worldly <hi rend="i">pathos</hi>, have to go along with everything else. To accomplish this,
                        the Zoas and Emanations must all join together to play their rightful roles.
                        Although the labors of Urizen, Tharmas, and Urthona are quite striking as
                        humanity and the fallen world get completely “reprocessed”
                        into a feast for the Eternals, the most frightening apocalyptic image that
                        Blake presents here is the winepresses of Luvah. To prepare the Last
                        Vintage, the sons and daughters of Luvah dance and laugh, accompanied by
                        various creatures around the presses, as they tread upon “the Human
                        Grapes [that] Sing not nor dance” but instead “howl &amp;
                        writhe in shoals of torment in fierce flames consuming” and amidst
                        various instruments of torture (136:5-39, E 404-05).<ref target="n27" type="note">27</ref> Then, at last, with the world as we know it utterly
                        annihilated, “the evil is all consumd” and Albion is again
                        “Man”—regenerated, visionary, and alive with the
                        harmony and order of the universe within him (138:22, E 406). <note id="n27">27. In Revelation 14:20, the winepress in John’s vision seems
                            almost banal compared to Blake’s: “And the winepress was
                            trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto
                            the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred
                            furlongs.”</note></p>
          <p>I have focused here on the violence of Blake’s Last Judgment and its
                        human tinder because the apocalypse presents, I think, his ultimate revision
                        of sentimentality and the entire movement that it fostered. Every human
                        life—from victim to victimizer, from youth to elder—has to be
                        trodden in the winepresses or baked in the ovens of the Zoas—and, as
                        the feast implies, actually consumed by Eternal beings. Blake challenges us
                        to mimic Los, to use our visionary capacity to see through the vegetated
                        world and the (necessary) violence of its consummation in order to reveal
                        the spiritual “World within.” Because even Los, the most
                        inspired Zoa, fails to maintain that redemptive vision continuously and to
                        change the system of error, something more extreme is required. Blake
                        therefore envisions existence falling to its nadir with the crucifixion,
                        which then must be followed by the utter transformation and redemptive
                        consumption of those familiar objects that might otherwise elicit sympathy
                        and prevent such a Last Judgment.</p>
          <p>We can, I think, see the persistence of this fallen sentimentality in Los and
                        Enitharmon’s refusal to sacrifice their children at the end of Night
                        VIIa. Their pity for their children seems praiseworthy, especially when
                        contrasted with the “Storgous Appetite” that leads to
                        Orc’s binding in Night V. However, those newborn human souls that
                        they pity in Night VIIa have to be thrown into the winepresses or sown in
                        the ruins of the universe; even parental love is a tie to the fallen world.
                        Their pity may be another critique of sentimentalism because, as
                        Barker-Benfield observes, “the aggrandizement of the affectionate
                        family and, at its heart, mothering,” were central components of
                        sentimentalism through their cultivation of desired social affections (276).
                        However, as he also describes, the emphasis placed on a sentimental family
                        often led to “parental self-indulgence” and disabling
                        sensibility instead of greater communal sentiments. Wollstonecraft speaks to
                        this very problem when she condemns spoiling mothers who “for the
                        sake of their <hi rend="i">own</hi> children . . . violate the most sacred
                        duties, forgetting the common relationship that binds the whole family of
                        earth together” (290). Admittedly, Blake is more extreme, but it
                        seems that Los and Enitharmon are still guilty of an affection that holds
                        them back from their Eternal places and from working for the greater good.
                        These parents pity their children as pathetic, corporeal beings, as spectres
                        with physical bodies; they refuse to make the sacrifice of <hi rend="i">all</hi> physical things—and of all sympathetic attachments to
                        them—that the final Night shows is required for the regeneration of
                        humanity.</p>
          <p>According to Blake’s mythology, the status of the Emanations and of
                        (sentimental) females as a whole necessitates that they become
                        undifferentiated from their male counterparts in order to reconstitute the
                        androgynous Zoas. Blake expresses this point in the poem’s closing
                        lines: “Urthona is arisen in his strength no longer now / Divided
                        from Enitharmon no longer the Spectre Los” (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi>
                        139:4-5, E 407). Once again whole, Urthona can forge the armor that Albion
                        wears in the “intellectual War” of Eternity (139:8-9, E 407).
                        But what exactly does “whole” imply for Urthona and the other
                        Eternals in terms of the sexes, specifically the female sex? Blake does say
                        that both Enitharmon <hi rend="i">and</hi> the male “Spectre
                        Los” have disappeared as distinct, sexed identities. Nevertheless,
                        here again we meet one problem of describing Eternity from the <pb id="p39-76" n="76"/> realm of Generation, since the
                        “fallen” language that Blake uses is also gendered language.
                        The masculine singular pronoun “his” in lines 4 and 8,
                        referring to “arisen” and undivided Urthona, further casts the
                        Eternal state as vigorous and masculine in contrast to the delusive,
                        “feminine” lower states that have been the major arena for the
                        poem’s action. While both of the separated sexes have apparently
                        reunited into single androgynous beings, Blake’s masculinized
                        language here and throughout makes it <hi rend="i">most</hi> apparent that
                        the females have been reintegrated or re-internalized. And, as Albion tells
                        Urizen shortly before the Last Judgment occurs, the Zoas are
                        “Immortal” while the Emanations are simply
                        “Regenerate” (122:12, E 391). Peter Otto thus questions the
                        ending of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, which he sees as representing
                        “a Urizenic ideal” in part because the Emanations are
                        “now indistinguishable from their male counterparts” (337-38).
                        However, the poem contains numerous reminders—some from the
                        Emanations themselves—that the Emanations are <hi rend="i">emanated</hi> and hence secondary, just like the physical body they are
                        associated with. Indeed, this “disappearance” of the female is
                        in many ways the most telltale sign of regeneration based on Blake’s
                        association of femininity with the entire fallen world. As a result, he
                        makes it apparent that the Emanations have returned to their places as
                        portions of the Zoas after the apocalypse; once this is accomplished, the
                        Zoas can function harmoniously within Albion and Albion can rejoin the
                        “Eternal Brotherhood.”</p>
          <p>The re-internalization of the Emanations, with the destruction of sentimental
                        stereotypes, is the final move that Blake makes in his re-vision of
                        sentimental conventions and the sentimental system. This re-vision, an
                        incorporation of passive sentimentality into active inspired vision, is by
                        no means Blake’s central agenda in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>,
                        but it is as much a part of his “Dream” as it is a part of the
                        fallen world. Sentimentality may, at its best, reduce the sting of the fall,
                        but it can do nothing to regenerate humanity without the strength of vision
                        to guide it. In his later prophecies and other writings, Blake emphasizes
                        this point more explicitly against the backdrop of Eternity, as Los’s
                        inspired mission and message come to center on pity and forgiveness of sin
                        amidst continued sentimental, hypocritical oppression. Only through the
                        regeneration of worldly sentimentality, which Blake seems to trace through
                        the nine Nights of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, can a visionary prophet
                        redeem the fallen world with tenderness and love that are inspired, not
                        selfishly or superficially pitying, not tools for manipulation. As Blake
                        puts it in terms of his mythology, “Tharmas gave his Power to Los
                        Urthona gave his strength” (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 111 [107]:31, E
                        383).</p>

          <p>Henry Banes was the brother-in-law of William and Catherine Blake as well as
                        their landlord at 3 Fountain Court, Strand, from 1821 until 1827.<ref target="n170" type="note">*</ref> This paper
                        will focus primarily upon the contents of Henry Banes’ will, a
                        document hitherto unknown to Blake scholarship.<ref target="n28" type="note">1</ref> As well as explicitly referring to, and providing new
                        information about, William and Catherine Blake, Banes’ will throws
                        new light on the Blakes’ relationship with their relative and
                        landlord. The will also contains information pertinent to a clearer
                        understanding of Catherine Blake’s financial affairs and how and
                        where she was living in the spring of 1829, approximately eighteen months
                        after the death of her husband. In addition, the document provides the dates
                        of the decease of Henry Banes and his wife, Catherine Blake’s sister,
                        Sarah Banes, and evidence of Sarah’s residence at 3 Fountain Court
                        from 1803 until March 1824. Sarah’s established presence at this
                        address may partially explain William and Catherine Blake’s choice of
                        residence on removal from their apartment at 17 South Molton Street in 1821.
                        <note id="n170">* The first two sections of this
                            paper derive largely from chapter 3 of my MA dissertation

          <p>It has been previously assumed that, apart from Blake’s younger
                        sister, Catherine Elizabeth Blake, William and Catherine Blake had no
                        surviving family relations. I will argue that the circumstances surrounding
                        Banes’ choice of “sole Executrix” of his will suggest
                        that Henry and Sarah Banes may have had a daughter and therefore that
                        William and Catherine Blake may have been survived by a niece, named Louisa
                        (or Louiza) Best, née Banes.<ref target="n29" type="note">2</ref>
                        Finally, the sole witness of Henry Banes’ will, the artist John
                        Barrow, will be conclusively identified as the publisher of Blake’s
                        commercial engraving “Mrs Q” (1820). <note id="n29">2.

            <p>In about 1860, Blake’s biographer, the 32-year-old Alexander
                            Gilchrist, visited Fountain Court, on the south side of the Strand, in
                            order to research William and Catherine Blake’s last residence.
                            At 3 Fountain Court Gilchrist encountered a “dirty
                            stuccoed” building that had “suffered a decline of
                                fortune”<ref target="n30" type="note">3</ref> (illus. 1). The
                            front room on the first floor, the Blakes’ former reception room,
                            showroom and printing studio, was vacant and “in the market at
                            four and sixpence a week, as an assiduous enquirer found.”<ref target="n31" type="note">4</ref> The rest of the house was
                            “let out . . . in single rooms to the labouring poor.”<ref target="n32" type="note">5</ref> During his visit, Gilchrist could
                            have encountered a number of the 36 inhabitants recorded in the 1861
                            census return for 3 Fountain Court. Amidst the “excessive noise
                            of children,”<ref target="n33" type="note">6</ref> he may have
                            called on and conversed with William Jones, wine porter, George Caudle,
                            vellum binder, Mary Huntley, laundress, James Stone, onion dealer,
                            William Wilby, police constable, William Jones, carman, James Haywood,
                            fishmonger, and Thomas Curtis, water gilder, and their respective
                                families.<ref target="n34" type="note">7</ref> However, it seems
                            unlikely that anyone then living either at this residence or elsewhere
                            in Fountain Court had been a fellow lodger or neighbor of William and
                            Catherine Blake over 30 years earlier. <note id="n30">3. Gilchrist

                            little new information concerning those who lived and worked alongside
                            William and Catherine Blake during their six year residence in the
                            court. According to Gilchrist, “for two years together”
                            Blake did not venture outside Fountain Court.<ref target="n38" type="note">11</ref> Surviving records for the period 1821-27
                            suggest that Blake spent months rather than years without leaving the
                            precincts of the court.<ref target="n39" type="note">12</ref> However,
                            the likelihood that Blake did spend such relatively long and
                            uninterrupted periods within its environs means that any new information
                            concerning William and Catherine Blake’s last residence and
                            neighborhood is of no small importance to Blake scholarship. <note id="n35">8. Gilchrist 308.</note><note id="n36">9. Gilchrist does refer to a “humble female
                                neighbour, [Catherine Blake’s] only other companion”

                                description of Blake’s death resembles a line in Sydney

                                November 1827 in which he reports that Catherine Blake told his

            <p>One fellow resident well placed to throw light on the Blakes’ life
                            and work during this period is Henry Banes, William and Catherine
                            Blake’s brother-in-law and landlord at 3 Fountain Court. However,
                            few biographers of William Blake have succeeded in tracing more than
                            Banes’ name. In a letter to the Quaker poet Bernard Barton of 3
                            April 1830, John Linnell, Blake’s friend and patron during the
                            1820s, describes William and Catherine Blake’s last shared
                            residence as “a private House Kept by M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Banes
                            whose wife was sister to M<hi rend="s">rs</hi> Blake.”<ref target="n40" type="note">13</ref> Linnell’s only other
                            recorded reference to Henry Banes is found in the final line of a
                            “Note by J[ohn]. L[innell]. sen[ior]. on strip of paper”
                            “1855?”, transcribed by Linnell’s son John Linnell,
                            Jr. Bentley describes this note as “clearly the heads of what
                            Linnell meant to tell Gilchrist of Blake’s life.”<ref target="n41" type="note">14</ref> The line reads “[Blake]
                            died at his Brother in Laws first floor 3 F[ountain]

                            “head” Linnell does not appear to have provided Gilchrist
                            with any further information concerning Blake’s last landlord.
                            Gilchrist’s allusion to Banes in a description of Blake’s
                            final residence as “a house kept by a brother-in-law named Baines
                                [sic]”<ref target="n43" type="note">16</ref> merely

                                this information from John Linnell. Between 1803 and 1822 the Poor
                                Rate collectors responsible for Fountain Court consistently recorded
                                Henry Banes’ surname as “Baines” in their rate
                                books (see illus. 2). However, Banes’ marriage record (illus.
                                7), the only traced document to feature his signature, entries in
                                contemporary trade directories (illus. 4) and poll books (illus. 3),
                                as well as Banes’ own will (illus. 5) all suggest that
                                “Banes” is the correct spelling.</note></p>
            <p>Since Gilchrist, few further details concerning Henry Banes have been
                            traced. Almost a century after the publication of Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life</hi>, Paul Miner consulted the Poor Rate books for the

                            Baines’ or ‘Banes’ . . . is listed [as ratepayer]
                            for the house [i.e., 3 Fountain Court] during the period of
                            Blake’s occupancy.”<ref target="n44" type="note">17</ref>
                            In his recent biography of Blake, <hi rend="i">The Stranger from
                                Paradise</hi> (2001), Bentley offers a little more information
                            concerning Henry Banes. The biography features a reconstruction of the
                            Boucher family tree in which Sarah Boucher is first identified as the
                            sister of Catherine Blake who married Henry Banes. The location and date
                            of the marriage are given as St. Bride’s Church, Fleet Street, 10
                            November 1788.<ref target="n45" type="note">18</ref> Bentley also
                            records the location (but not the date) of Henry Banes’ baptism,

                            edition of <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, Bentley gives the (correct)
                            date of Henry Banes and Sarah Boucher’s marriage as 16 December
                            1788, as well as details concerning the banns, the curate who performed
                            the marriage and the identity of one of the three witnesses.<ref target="n48" type="note">21</ref> Bentley also expands upon
                            Miner’s findings concerning the identity of the ratepayers for
                            the property: “The Rate Books confirm that the rate-payers were
                            Henry and Mary Baines (or Banes) from 1820 to 1829.”<ref target="n49" type="note">22</ref> In an attempt to reconcile the
                            discrepancy between the first names given to Banes’ wife in the
                            marriage certificate of 1788 and the rate book entries almost forty
                            years later, Bentley suggests that “Perhaps Catherine’s
                            sister Sarah Boucher . . . was also called ‘Mary’ after
                            her mother, Mary Davis Boucher.”<ref target="n50" type="note">23</ref><note id="n44">17. Paul Miner, “William Blake’s London

                                Bain (not Baines) was buried in St Andrew’s Church, Holborn,
                                in 1837, according to Boyd’s Burial Index in
                                Guildhall” (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 50fn). As I demonstrate
                                below, Henry Bain (actually buried at Bunhill Fields) cannot have
                                been Blake’s landlord at Fountain Court. <hi rend="i">Boyd’s Burial Index</hi> is an unpublished index of
                                London and Middlesex burials in parish register transcripts,
                                compiled by Percival Boyd (1866-1955). Boyd only indexed burial
                                registers which had been transcribed and were easily accessible.
                                With the help of the College of Arms, Boyd copied about a quarter of
                                a million burials between 1538 and 1852, including a large part of
                                the registers of Bunhill Fields nonconformist burial ground. See
                                Anthony Camp, “Our Greatest Indexer—Percival

                                (December 2003): 22-24. In the introduction to his <hi rend="i">Burial Index</hi> Boyd remarks, “Those who use this
                                index are warned that it must be treated as a ‘lucky

                                recorded: “Henry Ba[i]nes for 1820-22, 1826-28; Mary Banes
                                for 1823; and both for 1824 and 1825” (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>
                                [2] 751fn). Bentley goes on to state that in the Poor Rate books 3
                                Fountain Court “is specifically called a
                                ‘House’ to distinguish it from the warehouses in the
                                area . . .” (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 751fn). This does not
                                appear to have been the case and would not have been necessary, as
                                the 16 residences in Fountain Court were separated from the
                                warehouses of Beaufort Wharfs by a flight of stairs. See Whitehead

            <p>A letter from Blake to John Linnell recently discovered by Michael
                            Phillips provides the sole recorded reference to Henry Banes by
                                Blake.<ref target="n51" type="note">24</ref> The letter, postmarked
                            “25 · NO 1825”, begins: <q>
                                M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Banes says his Kitchen is at our service to do
                                as we please. Still I should like to know from the Printer whether
                                our own Kitchen would not be equally or even more convenient as the
                                Press being already there would save a good deal of time &amp;
                                trouble in taking down &amp; putting up which is no slight job
                                [cited Phillips 140]. </q> Phillips demonstrates that the new letter
                            refers to preparations for a specially organized printing session of the
                                <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of Job</hi> using
                            Blake’s rolling press at 3 Fountain Court. The printing session
                            was to be conducted by a fine art plate-printer, an employee of the
                            copperplate printer James Lahee, and overseen by Blake and perhaps
                            Linnell. It must have taken place in late November-early December 1825,
                            immediately after the engraving and final proofing of the plates and
                            immediately before the printing of the 315 sets of the <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of Job</hi> at Lahee’s premises at
                            No. 30 Castle Street East, Oxford Market. As Phillips observes: <q> It
                                was now the moment to confer with Lahee’s plate-printer to
                                supervise with him the printing of master impressions for each of
                                the 22 plates. The plate-printer would then be able to return to the
                                Castle Street works and left to get on with it.<ref target="n52" type="note">25</ref></q> This printing session, lasting no longer than a few days, would
                            normally have been conducted at Lahee’s Castle Street works.
                            However, as Blake was evidently incapacitated by illness at this time
                            and therefore unable to travel so far, 3 Fountain Court was proposed as
                            an alternative location. Banes’ “Kitchen” in the
                            basement of 3 Fountain Court, as opposed to Blake’s printing
                            studio in the front room on the first floor, appears to have been
                            proposed by Linnell as the most suitable area of the house in which to
                            conduct the printing session. As Blake’s letter indicates, Banes
                            readily agreed to this proposal. However, due to the considerable
                            technical difficulties involved in dismantling Blake’s printing
                            press, moving it from the Blakes’ front room to Banes’
                            basement and reassembling it there (which Blake describes as “no
                            slight job”), the press almost certainly remained where it was.
                            Therefore, in the event, it seems that Banes’ basement was never
                            utilized as a temporary printing studio (see Phillips). Nevertheless, as
                            Bentley suggests, the fact that Banes was willing to give up his kitchen
                            to accommodate his brother-in-law’s printing shows that
                            “The relationship of Henry Banes and William Blake was clearly a
                            friendly one.”<ref target="n53" type="note">26</ref><note id="n51">24. For discussion of the letter, see Phillips, Whitehead

                                1818, Henry Banes voted for the law reformer Sir Samuel Romilly and
                                Sir Francis Burdett, the campaigner for free speech and prison
                                reform, as Member of Parliament for Westminster. Romilly won the
                                Westminster seat. However, in November 1818, days after the death of
                                his wife, Romilly committed suicide. Consequently, another election
                                for the Westminster seat was held in February 1819. At this
                                election, Banes voted for the Whig candidate George Lamb. The death
                                of George III on 29 January 1820 brought parliament to an end and a
                                general election was held the following month. In this election,
                                Banes voted for George Lamb’s opponents Burdett and the
                                moderate radical (and friend of Byron) John Cam Hobhouse. Burdett
                                and Hobhouse won and continued to serve as Members of Parliament for
                                Westminster well into the 1830s.</note><note id="n58">31. As Henry Banes was married in 1788, it is likely that
                                he was at least 50 when he entered his name, trade and address in
                                the Westminster Poll Book for 1818.</note><note id="n59">32. Anon., <hi rend="i">The Book of Trades and

                                cooper or vintner, in any trade directory for the period. It is
                                therefore possible that he was employed at a nearby public house
                                such as the Coal Hole in Fountain Court or the Plough at the
                                intersection of Herbert’s Passage and Beaufort Buildings.
                                A more likely employer may have been Banes’ neighbor
                                Samuel Edwards at 8 Fountain Court, at the end of the court and
                                therefore nearest the warehouses of Beaufort Wharfs. Edwards was
                                a wine merchant operating from nearby 8 Beaufort Buildings
                                (1779-1814) and 5 Robert Street, Adelphi (1815-26) (see <hi rend="i">Kent’s Directory</hi> [London: Henry Kent
                                Causton, 1779-1826]). In the rate books Edwards’ property
                                is distinct from the other 15 properties in the court in being
                                designated a “cellar” (see, for example, COWAC,

                                account (cited <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 727). John Linnell, a
                                regular visitor to Blake’s rooms at Fountain Court, may
                                also have taken an interest in Blake’s landlord’s
                                profession. Alfred T. Story, in his <hi rend="i">Life of
                                    Linnell</hi>, recounts how Linnell “was very careful
                                in choosing his wine. He would go down to the docks himself and
                                make his selection and when he had obtained the order for it, he
                                would fetch the cask himself and never lose sight of it until it
                                was safely deposited in his cellar” (Story 2:40-41). When
                                visiting 3 Fountain Court, Linnell may have joined Mr. Banes and
                                Mr. Blake in a glass (or indeed a tumbler) of wine.</note></p>
            <p>Two London directories of the period provide further evidence of Banes as
                            resident, rather than merely ratepayer, at 3 Fountain Court.
                            “Banes Mr. Hen. 3, Fountain-ct. Strand” is listed in the
                            residential section of <hi rend="i">Holden’s Triennial

                            residence at Fountain Court, may have been a man of some substance who
                            did not need to advertise his trade. <note id="n62">35. <hi rend="i">Holden’s Triennial Directory, 1805-6-7</hi> (London: W.

            <p>William and Catherine Blake, arriving 18 years after their brother-in-law
                            became ratepayer for 3 Fountain Court, were almost certainly not Henry

                            Strand, reveal evidence which suggests that at least one other family
                            was lodging with Henry and Sarah Banes before the Blakes’
                            arrival. According to these records, a Martha Walker, recorded as
                            resident at 3 Fountain Court, was buried aged three weeks in the
                            churchyard of St. Clement Danes, Strand, on 8 January 1816.<ref target="n63" type="note">36</ref> Although I have discovered no
                            information concerning Martha’s parents, it seems likely that

                                consulted at the National Archives, Kew. The fact that Banes left a

                                that he was a comparatively prosperous individual at the time of his

                            for the parish of St. Bride confirms that Henry Banes, bachelor, married

                                7).<ref target="n70" type="note">43</ref> With Sarah Banes,
                            née Boucher, conclusively identified as Banes’ wife, it is
                            puzzling that a “Mary Banes” rather than a “Sarah
                            Banes” is recorded as sole ratepayer, and therefore the
                            Blakes’ landlady, at 3 Fountain Court for 1823 and coratepayer
                            with Henry Banes for 1824-25.<ref target="n71" type="note">44</ref>
                            Bentley has suggested that “Mary” may have been a name
                            Sarah Banes was familiarly known by.<ref target="n72" type="note">45</ref> However, at the proving of Banes’ will, his legatee
                            and “sole Executrix” Louisa Best testified that Sarah
                            Banes died in March 1824, a year before “Mary Banes” is
                            last recorded as ratepayer for the residence. Such evidence initially
                            suggests that Sarah and “Mary Banes” are unlikely to have
                            been one and the same person. However, the appearance of “Mary
                            Banes” in the Poor Rate book in 1825, a year after Sarah
                            Banes’ death, may have been due to a failure by the Poor Rate
                            collector to amend his entry for 3 Fountain Court, Strand, in the ledger
                            for that year. After 1825, “Mary Banes” does not reappear
                            in the Poor Rate book entries for 3 Fountain Court. Nor is
                            “Mary” named as a beneficiary or executrix in Henry
                            Banes’ will, written in 1826. Therefore, “Mary” may
                            indeed have been the name Sarah Banes was familiarly known by.<ref target="n73" type="note">46</ref><note id="n69">42. See <hi rend="i">BR</hi> (2) 49.</note><note id="n70">43. Guildhall Library Ms 6542/2, 1386. As Bentley
                                observes, the curate of St. Bride’s, John Pridden, officiated
                                at the ceremony (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 49). Pridden’s
                                father was a bookseller in Fleet Street. As well as performing his
                                clerical duties, Pridden was also an antiquary, amateur artist and
                                architect (see <hi rend="i">Alumni Cantabrigiensis</hi> Part 2,
                                1752-1900, vol. 5 [Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1953] 197). The banns
                                for the marriage of Henry and Sarah Banes were read on the three
                                preceding Sundays: 30 November, 7 December and 14 December 1788
                                (Guildhall Library Ms 6544/4). The witnesses were William Shepherd,
                                W. Finch and E. Boucher. As Bentley suggests, E. Boucher is almost
                                certainly Sarah’s sister, Elizabeth Boucher (1747-91) (see
                                Bentley, <hi rend="i">Stranger</hi> 63fn, <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2]
                                50). The signatures of William Shepherd and W. Finch as witnesses at
                                other weddings at St. Bride’s suggest that they were parish
                                or church officials rather than friends or relatives of the couple.
                                See, for example, the marriage record for William Meredith and
                                Hannah Price, 1 December 1788 (Guildhall Library Ms 6542/2, 1383).
                                Indeed, in the record of the baptism of William Shepherd and his
                                wife Elizabeth’s son, Joseph Gardner Shepherd, St.
                                Bride’s, 20 December 1789, William’s occupation is
                                recorded as “parish clerk” (see St. Bride’s
                                baptismal register, Guildhall Library Ms 6541/2).</note><note id="n71">44. COWAC, B246-48.</note><note id="n72">45. <hi rend="i">BR</hi> (2) 751fn.</note><note id="n73">46. Conversely, perhaps a relation of Henry Banes named
                                Mary Banes may have lived at 3 Fountain Court and have left or died
                                between her last appearance in the Poor Rate book on 6 October 1825
                                and Henry Banes’ composition of his new will on 9 December
                                1826.</note></p>
            <p>The discovery that Catherine Blake’s sister, Sarah Banes, was a
                            fellow resident with William and Catherine at 3 Fountain Court from 1821
                            until her death in March 1824 suggests that Sarah’s presence may
                            have been a consideration in the Blakes’ choice of residence on
                            leaving 17 South Molton Street. Perhaps Sarah, then in her mid-60s, was
                            ill and therefore welcomed her younger sister Catherine’s company
                            and care. Three years later, Sarah’s death may very well have
                            altered living arrangements at 3 Fountain Court. It is possible that
                            after March 1824, William and Catherine Blake and Henry Banes, widower,
                            spent more time in each other’s company. As the new letter
                            reveals, the Banes’ and the Blakes’ use of their

                            more fluid than previously realized.<ref target="n74" type="note">47</ref> The wording of his will suggests that Banes had few, if
                            any, other living relatives. His significant bequest to Catherine, and
                            the wording of his legacy to Blake at the time of the writing of his
                            will in late 1826, “I beg Mr Blakes acceptance . . .,”
                            suggest a cordial relationship between Henry Banes and his brother-and
                            sister-in-law. It is also likely that, from the spring of 1824 onwards,
                            Banes, as a widower, required less personal living space and could
                            therefore have invited other households to lodge at his house.<ref target="n75" type="note">48</ref><note id="n74">47. See Whitehead 27-28; Phillips 138-42.</note><note id="n75">48. See Samuel Calvert’s anecdote concerning his

                                Calvert’s anecdote refers to an incident that must almost
                                certainly have occurred after Sarah Banes’ death, as his
                                father is unlikely to have met Blake before late 1824 (see Lister
                                10). Bentley suggests that the incident may have occurred during
                                “the winter of [i.e., between February and March]
                                1826” (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 438).</note></p>

                            lodgers at his house for a period of approximately seven years, are
                            recorded as legatees in his will. The discovery of a new contemporary
                            reference to William Blake is a relatively rare event and clearly of
                            interest to Blake scholars. However, the legacy Henry Banes intended to
                            leave to William Blake appears comparatively slight. In Banes’
                            will, other names take precedence. Of these, Catherine Blake has
                            received some, if minor, attention in biographical studies of her
                            husband. Richard and Louisa Best and their family and the artist John
                            Barrow are relatively unknown.<ref target="n78" type="note">51</ref> Due
                            to their apparent proximity to Blake in his final years, these names

                                elusive. There is no record of the burial of a Henry Banes during

                                751fn). The identity of John or J. Barrow has been briefly discussed

            <p>In his will, Henry Banes wrote: “I give &amp; bequeath to
                            Catherine Blake half my household goods consisting of Bedsteads Beds
                            &amp; pillows Bolsters &amp; sheets &amp; pillow cases Tables Chairs
                            &amp; crockery &amp; £20 in lawful money of Great
                            Britain.” During the four years of her widowhood, Catherine
                            enjoyed the material support of several of her late husband’s
                            friends. She also derived some income from the sale of items from her
                            remaining stock of her husband’s works.<ref target="n79" type="note">52</ref> Nevertheless, Banes’ bequest to
                            Catherine is materially significant. In the spring of 1829, such a
                            legacy would have been welcome to a widow whose financial situation at
                            that time would almost certainly have been modest, perhaps even
                                precarious.<ref target="n80" type="note">53</ref> However, did
                            Catherine Blake receive Banes’ bequest? No record of
                            Catherine’s inheriting a portion of her brother-in-law’s
                            estate has been traced. This is not altogether surprising. Most
                            surviving records relating to Catherine Blake’s financial
                            circumstances in the period from her husband’s death in August
                            1827 to her own death in October 1831 derive from the account books of
                            John Linnell. After Blake’s death, Linnell both bought, and
                            helped Catherine to sell, a number of those of her husband’s
                            works still in her possession.<ref target="n81" type="note">54</ref><note id="n79">52. In addition, Blake’s painting and printing
                                materials were almost certainly still in Catherine’s
                                possession. Catherine may also have retained Blake’s domestic
                                copperplate rolling press. According to Linnell’s journal,
                                the press arrived at his residence at 6 Cirencester Place on 30
                                August 1827. Catherine followed on 11 September (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 468, 471). It is unclear whether the press
                                accompanied Catherine when she moved to Frederick Tatham’s
                                residence in the late spring of 1828. Much of her furniture appears
                                to have been sold at this time (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 791).
                                This may have been because Tatham did not have as much space
                                available for Catherine and her possessions as Linnell had had at
                                his residence. If Catherine’s press was also sold by Linnell
                                in 1828, Tatham, in his printing of posthumous copies of
                                Blake’s illuminated books such as <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                                copies H, I and J (c. 1832), may have used another press such as,
                                perhaps, that of fellow “Ancient” Edward Calvert. See
                                Lister 24.</note><note id="n80">53. In terms of his bequest, Henry Banes appears to have
                                been comparatively generous towards his sister-in-law. However, one
                                wonders why Catherine left 3 Fountain Court, Banes’ house and
                                her home for approximately six and a half years, on 11 September
                                1827, only a month after her husband’s decease (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 471). Perhaps Banes could not afford to
                                have Catherine occupy the best floor of the house rent-free.</note><note id="n81">54. See <hi rend="i">BR</hi> (2) 474-88, 504,

            <p>In September 1827, a month after Blake’s death, Linnell also
                            provided a home and employment (as housekeeper) for Catherine.<ref target="n82" type="note">55</ref> This arrangement came to an end in
                            the late spring of 1828, when Linnell sold his town residence and studio
                            at 6 Cirencester Place, Fitzroy Square, and moved with his <pb id="p39-88" n="88"/> family to 26 Porchester Terrace, Bayswater.<ref target="n83" type="note">56</ref> Before vacating Cirencester Place,
                            Linnell appears to have found Catherine a new home (and employment) with
                            Frederick Tatham, the son of the Blakes’ old friend, the
                            architect Charles Heathcote Tatham, and a member of the circle of young
                            artists known as the “Ancients.”<ref target="n84" type="note">57</ref> With Catherine no longer his fellow resident,
                            employee or immediate responsibility, Linnell appears to have played a
                            less active role in her life.<ref target="n85" type="note">58</ref> He
                            therefore may not have been aware of Henry Banes’ legacy to
                            Catherine and is certainly unlikely to have recorded details of it in
                            his account books or his journal. Any papers of Frederick
                            Tatham’s relating to the period of Catherine Blake’s
                            residence with him, which may have referred to Banes’ legacy,
                            have not been traced. It seems highly probable then that Catherine did
                            receive her brother-in-law’s bequest. <note id="n82">55. <hi rend="i">BR</hi> (2) 754.</note><note id="n83">56. Story 1:248; David Linnell 116.</note><note id="n84">57. David Linnell 116. David Linnell does not cite a
                                source for this information. However, in response to my query, he
                                replied “The meeting between F. Tatham and Linnell is
                                recorded in Linnell’s journal. 29th March 1828 . . .

                                move is not mentioned . . . But as Linnell was getting rid of
                                Cirencester Place and needed Mrs Blake to move out it is reasonable
                                to assume that this was discussed over dinner—especially as
                                she moved to live with Tatham” (email, 15 March 2005). David
                                Linnell has also suggested that if Catherine had moved into
                                independent lodgings on leaving Cirencester Place, Linnell would
                                almost certainly have helped with her rent (email 17 March 2005). No
                                such payments are recorded in Linnell’s account book entries
                                for the period 1828-30 (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 791-93).</note><note id="n85">58. In his journal, Linnell records a visit to Catherine
                                Blake on 19 September 1828, almost six months after she had left
                                Cirencester Place (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 488). His next
                                recorded visit took place on 27 January 1829, when Catherine told
                                him “that M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Blake told her he thought I
                                    sh<hi rend="s">d</hi> pay 3 gs. a piece for the Plates of
                                Dante—” (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 493). On 3 March
                                1830, Linnell accompanied Haviland Burke to Catherine’s
                                residence in order to purchase “two Drawings 8 gs. two Prints
                                of Job &amp; Ezekiel 2 gs &amp; the color<hi rend="s">d</hi> Copy

                                John Jebb, Bishop of Limerick (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 509).
                                According to Bentley, Linnell also called on Catherine on 3 August
                                and 3 September 1830 (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 534). However, on
                                checking the relevant volume of Linnell’s journal (collection
                                of the Manuscripts Department of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge,
                                MS 8-2000), Nicholas Robinson, Curator of Manuscripts at the
                                Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, could find no entry referring to
                                Linnell’s visiting Catherine on 3 August 1830 (email 5 April
                                2005). By early 1831, as Bentley observes, “Catherine had
                                become suspicious and mistrustful of Linnell’s
                                motives” (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 537). There is no record
                                of John Linnell and Catherine Blake’s meeting again before
                                her death on 18 October 1831. However, Linnell records payments to

                                Tatham’s letter is transcribed by Thomas Hartley Cromek, son
                                of Blake’s former employer Robert Cromek, in his ms.
                                “Recollections of Conversations with Mr John Pye”
                                (1865) 56-58 (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 871n37). Dennis Read has
                                identified Tatham’s correspondent as an acquaintance of
                                William and Catherine Blake, the engraver John Pye (see Dennis Read,
                                “‘An eminent but neglected genius’: An Early
                                Frederick Tatham Letter about William Blake,” <hi rend="i">English Language Notes</hi> 19 [September 1981]: 30). If Pye
                                was Tatham’s correspondent, it is difficult to reconcile
                                Pye’s sending a letter for Catherine to Fountain Court in
                                early 1829 when he had called on her at Cirencester Place a year
                                earlier (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 482). Is it possible that
                                Catherine returned to live at Fountain Court for a brief period
                                between the spring of 1828 and the spring of 1829? Conversely, Pye,
                                aware of Catherine’s leaving Cirencester Place, but unsure of
                                her address in early 1829, and unaware of Banes’ recent
                                death, may have sent his letter to Catherine’s previous
                                residence, 3 Fountain Court, assuming her brother-in-law would
                                ensure she received it.</note></p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">The Stranger from Paradise</hi>, Bentley asserts that
                            Catherine remained at Frederick Tatham’s residence and did not
                            move to her own lodgings until “early 1831.”<ref target="n86" type="note">59</ref> However, a transcription of a
                            letter from Tatham to an unnamed correspondent, and two letters from
                            Catherine herself to Sir George O’Brien Wyndham, third Earl of
                            Egremont, suggest that Catherine had moved to lodgings two years
                                earlier.<ref target="n87" type="note">60</ref> In his letter, dated
                            11 April 1829, Tatham writes: <q> But to answer your enquiry, which

                                    for the sake of brevity, omits any reference to Catherine
                                    Blake’s having formerly resided either with John Linnell
                                    or himself. However, see note 60.</note></q> In the light of this evidence, Bentley has revised his theory as to
                            where Catherine resided after leaving Linnell’s town house. In
                                <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> he suggests that: <q> Catherine
                                Blake moved in the spring of 1828 from Linnell’s house in
                                Cirencester Place to lodge with a baker at 17 Upper Charlotte
                                Street, south-east of Fitzroy Square.<lb/> Shortly thereafter she
                                moved in with the Tathams in Lisson Grove to look after them. . . .
                                According to Tatham, “She then returned to the lodging in
                                which she had lived previously”. She had returned to Upper
                                Charlotte Street by the spring of 1829, for on 11 April Frederick
                                Tatham wrote “of M<hi rend="s">rs</hi> Blake’s removal
                                . . . to N<hi rend="s">o</hi> 17. Upper Charlotte S<hi rend="s">t</hi>”<ref target="n89" type="note">62</ref><note id="n89">62. <hi rend="i">BR</hi> (2) 754-55. However, Bentley
                                    also suggests that Catherine moved from the Tathams’ to
                                    private lodgings in “early 1830” (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 755).</note></q> As I hope to demonstrate in a paper currently in preparation,
                            several details in this passage require further revision. However, Henry
                            Banes’ will does appear to confirm Bentley’s suggestion
                            that Catherine Blake moved from Tatham’s residence to her own
                            lodgings before 11 April 1829. Catherine Blake was almost certainly
                            living at Frederick Tatham’s residence in late January-early
                            February 1829, when she learned of the death of her brother-in-law Henry
                            Banes. As Louisa Best was granted probate as executrix just over three
                            weeks after Banes’ death, Catherine could have received her
                            portion of the estate as early as late February or early March 1829.
                            Although it is likely that Catherine knew of Banes’ bequest to
                            her before his death, I contend that either news of, or her acceptance
                            of, her legacy <pb id="p39-89" n="89"/> in the spring of 1829 influenced
                            Catherine’s decision to move from Tatham’s residence to
                            her own lodgings. Bentley suggests that Catherine was “kept . . .
                            out of want for the rest of her life” in July 1829 when Lord
                            Egremont generously paid her £84 for her late husband’s
                            watercolor <hi rend="i">The Characters in Spenser’s
                                “Faerie Queene.”</hi><ref target="n90" type="note">63</ref> However, if approximately three months earlier Catherine
                            had received her legacy of £20 together with “Bedsteads Beds
                            &amp; pillows Bolsters &amp; sheets &amp; pillow cases Tables Chairs
                            &amp; crockery,” then Banes’ bequest, rather than
                            Egremont’s purchase, initially may have put Catherine out of need
                            by facilitating her move to her own lodgings.

            <p>In his “Life of Blake,” Tatham wrote: <q> [Catherine Blake]
                                resided for some time with the Author of this whose domestic
                                arrangements were entirely undertaken by her; until such changes
                                took place that rendered it impossible for her strength to continue
                                in this voluntary office of sincere affection &amp; regard.<ref target="n91" type="note">64</ref><note id="n91">64. Frederick Tatham, “Life of Blake”
                                    ms. (cited <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 690).</note></q> It is unclear what Tatham is referring to when he writes of
                            “such changes.” Bentley appears to interpret this passage
                            as meaning that Catherine’s move to her own lodgings was due to
                                infirmity.<ref target="n92" type="note">65</ref> However, both the
                            new evidence of Henry Banes’ legacy to Catherine and the
                            likelihood of her removal from Tatham’s residence at a
                            considerably earlier date than has previously been recognized suggest
                            that other factors may have influenced Catherine’s decision to
                            move out of Tatham’s chambers.<ref target="n93" type="note">66</ref> Indeed, Banes’ legacy coupled with Lord
                            Egremont’s purchase may have been the reason for
                            Catherine’s withdrawal of her application to the Artists’
                            General Benevolent Institution around January 1830 and for her return of
                            Princess Sophia’s gift of £100, its being something
                            “she could dispense with.”<ref target="n94" type="note">67</ref><note id="n92">65. See <hi rend="i">BR</hi> (2) 755; Bentley, <hi rend="i">Stranger</hi> 444.</note><note id="n93">66. Perhaps, as had been the case a year earlier when
                                Catherine left Linnell’s residence, the decision to move was
                                not entirely of her own making. Despite Tatham’s close
                                friendship with Catherine between 1827 and 1831, the relationship
                                appears to have shown signs of occasional strain. Joseph Hogarth
                                records a heated disagreement between Catherine and Tatham which
                                appears to have occurred at some point after Catherine’s
                                departure from Tatham’s residence during spring 1829 (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 493-94). However, this does not appear to
                                have been a factor in Catherine’s move. I suspect that by
                                “such changes” (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 690) Tatham
                                may be referring to the domestic changes which are likely to have
                                accompanied his marriage, which must have taken place some time
                                before Catherine’s death in the autumn of 1831. Gilchrist,
                                who interviewed and corresponded with Tatham, states that Catherine
                                Blake “died in Mrs Tatham’s arms” (Gilchrist

            <p>Following the passage in his will outlining his legacy to Catherine
                            Blake, Henry Banes inserted: “I also beg Mr Blakes acceptance of
                            my wearing apparel.” In the early nineteenth century, the bequest
                            of clothes in wills was a common practice. As Jane Cox has observed,
                            “Clothes were much more expensive and prized. . . . Coats . . .
                            and even shirts and underwear might be left to relatives and
                                friends.”<ref target="n95" type="note">68</ref> Nevertheless,
                            when writing his will in December 1826, it must have been particularly
                            evident to Henry Banes that both Blake as the wearer and Catherine as
                            the likely repairer of her husband’s coats, trousers, shirts, and
                            other costly “wearing apparel” could make effective use of
                            such a bequest.<ref target="n96" type="note">69</ref><note id="n95">68. Cox 28.</note><note id="n96">69. Similarly, Sarah Banes’ garments may have been
                                given to Catherine after Sarah’s death in March
                            1824.</note></p>
            <p>A year earlier, on his first visit to the Blakes’ two rooms in
                            Fountain Court, Henry Crabb Robinson recorded of William Blake that:
                            “Nothing could exceed the squalid air both of the apartment
                            &amp; his dress.”<ref target="n97" type="note">70</ref> Robinson
                            also intimates that both Blake and his wife’s dress were of an
                            “offensive character,” despite the couple’s
                            “air of natural gentility.”<ref target="n98" type="note">71</ref> Around 1832, Tatham posed the question “Had poor
                            half starved Blake ever a suit of clothes beyond the tatters on his
                                Back?”<ref target="n99" type="note">72</ref> However,
                            Gilchrist, perhaps citing the recollections of Linnell, George Richmond
                            or Samuel Palmer, observed that: <q> In [Blake’s] dress there was
                                similar triumph of the man over his poverty to that which struck one
                                in his rooms. Indoors he was careful, for economy’s sake, but
                                not slovenly: his clothes were threadbare, and his grey trousers had
                                worn black and shiny in front, like a mechanic’s. Out of
                                doors he was more particular, so that his dress did not, in the
                                streets of London, challenge attention either way. He wore black
                                knee breeches and buckles black worsted stockings, shoes which tied,
                                and a broad-brimmed hat. It was something like an old-fashioned
                                tradesman’s dress. But the general impression he made on you
                                was that of a gentleman, in a way of his own.<ref target="n100" type="note">73</ref></q><pb id="p39-90" n="90"/> Henry Banes, having married in the 1780s, is
                            likely to have been of a similar age, and evidently not of a dissimilar
                            build, to Blake. Although a tradesman, Banes was wealthy enough to pay
                            the rates, appear in the residential section of <hi rend="i">Holden’s Triennial Directory</hi> and leave a provable will.
                            As a consequence, one can imagine that Banes, in bequeathing his wearing
                            apparel to Blake, had intended to leave his brother-in-law a number of
                            presentable garments to replace those Gilchrist described as “the
                            common, dirty dress, poverty, and perhaps age, had rendered
                                habitual.”<ref target="n101" type="note">74</ref><note id="n97">70. H. C. Robinson, <hi rend="i">Diary</hi> 17 December

            <p>Henry Banes left the remainder, and clearly the majority, of his estate
                            to his appointed “sole Executrix” Louisa Best, wife of
                            Richard Best, watch escapement maker.<ref target="n102" type="note">75</ref> Banes left Louisa: <q> the remaining part of my household

                                whole and sole use or disposal. </q> The precise identity of Louisa
                            Best, Henry Banes’ “sole Executrix,” is unclear. An
                            examination of Banes’ will provides little explicit evidence that
                            at the time of writing his will in December 1826 he expected to be
                            survived by any children. It is possible that Louisa Best was Henry
                            Banes’ niece. Conversely, she may have been an acquaintance or
                            lodger whom Banes had grown fond of and wished to acknowledge in his
                            will. But, as we have seen, Banes did not merely leave Louisa Best a
                            bequest; he made her, rather than his sister-in-law Catherine Blake,
                            sole executrix. A possible explanation for Banes’ choice of
                            Louisa as executrix could be that he deemed the position and its
                            responsibilities too onerous for Catherine (who would have been 64 in
                            late 1826). However, this does not satisfactorily explain why Louisa
                            inherited the majority of Banes’ estate. <note id="n102">75.
                                Richard and Louisa Best had five children: Charles Best, born 1
                                April 1805, baptized Old Church, St. Pancras (St. Pancras parish
                                church, Euston Road) 1 May 1805; Charlotte Louisa Best, born 16
                                August 1807, baptized Old Church, St. Pancras 14 August 1808;
                                Elizabeth Best, born 19 December 1809, baptized 18 July 1817, Old
                                Church, St. Pancras; Thomas Best, born 4 December 1813, baptized 18
                                July 1817, Old Church, St. Pancras; Richard John Best, born 20 March
                                1815, baptized 18 July 1817, Old Church, St. Pancras (see <hi rend="i">IGI</hi>; London Metropolitan Archives X030/004;
                                X100/34). No reference to the marriage of a Louisa and Richard Best
                                prior to 1805 has been traced. In the PCC copy of Banes’
                                will, Louisa and her son Thomas Best are recorded as resident at 3
                                Fountain Court “on the sixth day of ffebruary 1829”
                                (PRO PROB 11/1751), just over a fortnight after the death of Henry
                                Banes. This evidence suggests that the Bests were resident at
                                Banes’ house before his death. In editions of <hi rend="i">Robson’s London Directory</hi> 1833-38, Richard Best is
                                described as a “watch escapement maker” conducting
                                business from 3 Fountain Court, Strand (see, for example, <hi rend="i">Robson’s London Directory</hi> [London: William
                                Robson, 1835] 348). It is curious that Richard Best is not listed as
                                watch escapement maker in directories before this date. However, if
                                Banes also left his house to Louisa Best, such a bequest could have
                                enabled Louisa’s husband to launch his own business. In 1839
                                Louisa Best replaced Richard Best as ratepayer for 3 Fountain Court
                                (COWAC, B272). Richard Best is not listed in the 1841 census entry
                                for the property. Therefore it seems likely that he died around
                                1839. However, the firm of “Richard Best, Watchmaker,”
                                appears to have remained at 3 Fountain Court, along with Louisa Best
                                and several of her children, until 1844 (see <hi rend="i">Post
                                    Office London Directory</hi> [London: Kelly &amp; Co, 1844]
                                233). By 1845 William Walker replaced Louisa Best as ratepayer (see
                                COWAC, B306).</note></p>
            <p>A more straightforward explanation may lie in the possibility that Louisa
                            Best was a more intimate relation of Henry Banes than Catherine Blake. I
                            suggest that whereas Catherine was Banes’ sister-in-law, Louisa
                            could have been his daughter.<ref target="n103" type="note">76</ref> At
                            my request, Philippa Hoskin of the Borthwick Institute of Historical
                            Research, University of York, the respository of the records of the
                            Prerogative Court of York, examined a transcript of Henry Banes’
                            will. Hoskin observed that the absence of the word
                            “daughter” in the will in no way precludes the possibility
                            that Louisa Best was the daughter of Henry Banes.<ref target="n104" type="note">77</ref> She added that the context of the will suggests
                            that its writer was a widower leaving the majority of his estate to his
                            daughter. Although Louisa Best is not explicitly named as the daughter
                            of Henry Banes, neither are the other legatees (William and Catherine
                            Blake) named as Banes’ brother- and sister-in-law.<ref target="n105" type="note">78</ref> Indeed, the fact that in her
                            testimony at the proving of Banes’ will Louisa was not obliged to
                            testify to the intimacy or longevity of her relationship with Henry
                            Banes, as her son Thomas and her lodger John Barrow were, again suggests
                            that Louisa was Banes’ daughter. In addition, <pb id="p39-91" n="91"/> in his will Banes makes no bequest to Louisa’s
                            husband Richard Best. Instead he stipulates that his legacy to Louisa is
                            “for her whole and sole use or disposal.” Banes does not
                            use this phrase in his bequest to Catherine Blake. It seems likely that
                            by including this phrase, Banes intended to ensure that his only
                            daughter maintained control over her legacy despite her marriage to
                            Richard Best. Banes’ choice of Louisa as “sole
                            Executrix” would have ensured that, as a married woman, her
                            entitlement to and share of the estate was protected. It is also
                            interesting to note that in the record of the proving of the will cited
                            above, Louisa is the authority for the fairly precise (to the month)
                            dating of the death of Sarah Banes almost five years earlier. This might
                            be deemed a detail that a daughter of Henry and Sarah Banes could be
                            relied upon to remember. <note id="n103">76. John Linnell describes 3
                                Fountain Court as “a private House Kept by M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Banes” (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 526-27). As
                                suggested above, Banes’ legacy to Louisa Best may therefore
                                have included the leasehold to 3 Fountain Court. This is suggested
                                by the fact that Louisa remained resident at this address after
                                Banes’ death and after the death of her husband c. 1839. In
                                the 1841 census entry for 3 Fountain Court, Louisa Best describes
                                herself as “ind[ependent]” (PRO HO 107/731/3 15). If
                                Banes was the owner or leaseholder of 3 Fountain Court, the
                                property, as real estate, would have passed automatically to the
                                next of kin without explicit reference in Banes’ will.</note><note id="n104">77. Banes’ will is comparatively brief and makes
                                no provision for the eventuality of a legatee’s predeceasing
                                him, as occurred with William Blake.</note><note id="n105">78. In reply to my query, Stephen Freeth, Keeper of

                                (email, 2 October 2003). The <hi rend="i">International Genealogical

                                Richard and Louisa Best. If Henry and Sarah Banes and Richard and
                                Louisa Best were living in London, records of the baptism of Louisa
                                Banes and the marriage of Richard and Louisa Best may survive in the
                                registers of the 10-20% of London parishes not currently covered by

            <p>According to the marriage register for St. Bride’s Church, Fleet
                            Street, Henry and Sarah Banes were married on 16 December 1788. The 1841
                            census return for 3 Fountain Court, Strand, records that Louisa Best was
                            50 years old in the summer of that year.<ref target="n106" type="note">79</ref> It is therefore likely that she was born between 1790 and
                            1791. That Louisa Best was born a year or two after the marriage of
                            Henry and Sarah Banes also supports the theory that Louisa was Henry and
                            Sarah’s daughter. Sarah Banes’ relatively mature age at
                            the time of her marriage (approximately 31) in 1788 suggests that Louisa
                            may have been Henry and Sarah Banes’ only surviving child.<ref target="n107" type="note">80</ref> In <hi rend="i">Blake

                                    “Louisa Best.” However, in the table of contents

                                    X’s in the list of contents before he lent it to
                                    Blake” (E 887).
                                <p>If Louisa Best’s age was recorded slightly inaccurately in
                                    the 1841 census return for 3 Fountain Court, as that of her son
                                    Thomas Best appears to have been, then she may have been born as
                                    early as the summer of 1789. <hi rend="i">IGI</hi> records give
                                    the date of Thomas Best’s birth as 4 December 1813.
                                    However, the 1841 census return for 3 Fountain Court records
                                    Best’s age as 25 on 6 June 1841, suggesting that he was
                                    born in 1815 or 1816. Could the infant Louisa Best, possibly the
                                    daughter of Catherine’s sister, Sarah, and the only
                                    traced offspring of William and Catherine Blake’s
                                    siblings, have been born at the time of the composition, relief

            <p>We cannot be sure when Louisa Best and her family moved to 3 Fountain
                            Court, Strand. However, it seems significant that during the proving of
                            Banes’ will on 6 February 1829, barely a fortnight after Henry
                            Banes’ death, Louisa, her son Thomas and her husband were
                            described as resident at this address. This detail, coupled with Louisa
                            and her son Thomas’ testimony that they searched for and found
                            Banes’ will on the evening of the day of his death (20 January
                            1829), suggests that the Best family may have been living at 3 Fountain
                            Court before Banes’ death. If Henry Banes had been ill for a
                            period of time before his death, Louisa, in all likelihood Banes’
                            only daughter, may have moved to Banes’ house along with her
                            husband and children in order to care for her father.</p>
            <p>If, as has been suggested above, Louisa Best was William and Catherine
                            Blake’s niece, her sons Thomas and Richard were two of the
                            Blakes’ grandnephews. In his testimony recorded in the probate
                            copy of Henry Banes’ will, Louisa Best’s 15-year-old son
                            Thomas describes himself as a “print colorer.”<ref target="n110" type="note">83</ref> Twelve years later, in the 1841
                            census return for 3 Fountain Court, Thomas and Richard both gave their
                            occupation as “artist.”<ref target="n111" type="note">84</ref> Their parents Richard and Louisa Best were the recorded
                            rate-payers for 3 Fountain Court between 1829 and 1845. The fact that
                            Louisa Best was appointed sole executrix in Henry Banes’ will in
                            December 1826 suggests that Louisa and her family, if not immediate
                            relatives, were almost certainly fellow lodgers or regular visitors of
                            Henry Banes at Fountain Court during the early-mid-1820s. William Blake,
                            John Barrow and the artists who visited them at 3 Fountain Court between
                            1821 and 1838 may have inspired Thomas and Richard Best to become first
                            print colorers and later artists.<ref target="n112" type="note">85</ref>

                            aged 13 and 12 respectively, whether they were the grandsons of Henry
                            Banes or merely the sons of Banes’ acquaintance Louisa Best,
                            could very well have visited the Blakes’ two rooms on the first
                            floor of 3 Fountain Court. On the panelled walls of the Blakes’
                            front room, which served as both reception room and printing studio, the
                            Best brothers would have seen a “good number” of temperas
                            and watercolors.<ref target="n113" type="note">86</ref> They may also
                            have observed William and Catherine Blake as they drew and painted or
                            while they printed, colored and finished copies of the illuminated
                            books. <note id="n110">83. PRO PROB 11/1751.</note><note id="n111">84. PRO HO 107/731/3 15. I have traced no record of
                                Richard Best Jr. as a print colorer. However, it seems likely that
                                as Thomas and Richard both described themselves as artists in 1841,
                                they were both (apprentice?) print colorers c. 1829. They may have
                                been employed as print colorers at Rudolph Ackermann’s
                                Repository nearby at 96 Strand. However, another source of training
                                and employment is discussed below. Between 1834 and 1839 a Thomas
                                Best, painter of domestic scenes, residing at Beaufort Buildings,
                                exhibited one painting at the Royal Academy and three at the Society
                                of British Artists (Graves, <hi rend="i">Dictionary of Artists</hi>
                                24). The eastern side of Beaufort Buildings backed onto the western
                                side of Fountain Court, Strand, which included the residence of the
                                Best family. The street was often used in trade and other
                                directories to distinguish Fountain Court, Strand, from the three
                                other Fountain Courts in early nineteenth-century London.
                                Best’s sole exhibit at the Royal Academy, “Miss
                                Cust” (exhibited 1834), may have been a portrait of
                                Charlotte, Mary or Emily, daughters of Christopher Cust, the
                                Bests’ (and formerly the Blakes’ and the
                                Banes’) neighbor at 7 Fountain Court, Strand (see Graves, <hi rend="i">Royal Academy</hi> 1:187; <hi rend="i">IGI</hi>; St.

                            engravings. John Barrow’s signature as witness of Henry
                            Banes’ will in December 1826, and his testimony at the proving of
                            Banes’ will in February 1829, reveal that the wine cooper and the
                            artist, and later lodger at 3 Fountain Court, had been “well
                            acquainted . . . for several years.”<ref target="n114" type="note">87</ref> It is now clear that in early-mid-1820, over
                            six years before witnessing Henry Banes’ will, John Barrow had
                            employed Banes’ brother-in-law William Blake to engrave the late
                            François Marie Huet Villiers’ portrait of George
                            IV’s former mistress, Mrs. Harriet Quentin (illus. 8). <note id="n114">87. PRO PROB 11/1751. J. Barrow exhibited 21 works at the
                                Royal Academy between 1797 and 1836 (see Graves, <hi rend="i">Royal
                                    Academy</hi> 1:129-30). According to Graves, Barrow also
                                exhibited four enamels at the [Royal] Society of British
                                Artists’ gallery in Sussex Street (Graves, <hi rend="i">Dictionary of Artists</hi> 16). However, Jane Johnson lists
                                eight works exhibited by Barrow at Sussex Street between 1824 and
                                1837 (Johnson 27). I wish to thank Catherine Taylor at Cambridge
                                University Library for this information. The Society of British
                                Artists was formed in 1824 and Barrow appears to have been a
                                founding member. Blake as well as Barrow would have been acquainted
                                with two of the society’s first presidents, Thomas Heaphy and
                                James Holmes (see E 773; <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 345). The Royal
                                Academy exhibition catalogues for 1831, 1835 and 1836 and the
                                Society of British Artists’ exhibition catalogues for 1832
                                and 1836 record Barrow as resident at Fountain Court (Graves, <hi rend="i">Royal Academy</hi> 1:130, Johnson 27). David Worrall
                                has observed that “Remarkably, Barrow’s final
                                residence—between 1831 and 1836—was Fountain Court,
                                Strand, Blake’s last address” (see Worrall 180n1).
                                Even more remarkably, in <hi rend="i">Robson’s Directory</hi>
                                of 1832 (London: William Robson, 1832) n. pag., John Barrow is
                                recorded as an “artist” resident at 3 Fountain Court,
                                Strand. Barrow’s address in the Royal Academy exhibition
                                catalogue for 1829 is recorded as 26 Denton Street, St. Pancras
                                (Graves, <hi rend="i">Royal Academy</hi> 1:130). St. Pancras is the
                                parish in which Louisa Best and her family appear to have been
                                resident before moving to Fountain Court (see note 75). However, at
                                the proving of Banes’ will at Doctor’s Commons on 13
                                February 1829, Barrow testified that he was resident at
                                “ffountain Court Strand” (PRO PROB 11/1751). As stated
                                above, Barrow was sole recorded witness at the writing of Henry
                                Banes’ will. If, as Jane Cox suggests, “wills were
                                witnessed by whoever happened to be in the house” (Cox 24),
                                Banes’ choice of John Barrow as witness may suggest that
                                Barrow was a lodger at 3 Fountain Court as early as December 1826.
                                In that case it is possible that he may have moved to 3 Fountain
                                Court soon after Sarah Banes’ death in March 1824. However,
                                Banes’ house may not have provided adequate space for two
                                separate artists’ studios. Evidence suggests that Banes had
                                another lodger on the second floor of 3 Fountain Court (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 439). However, as I will demonstrate in a
                                forthcoming paper, this was unlikely to have been John Barrow.
                                Therefore, it seems likely that Barrow occupied the first floor of 3
                                Fountain Court only after Catherine’s removal in
                                mid-September 1827 (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 471). Even if
                                Barrow was not resident at Henry Banes’ house in December
                                1826 when witnessing Banes’ will, the fact that he was sole
                                witness to Banes’ will clearly suggests a friendship between
                                the two men. This relationship between Banes and Barrow, miniature
                                painter, Royal Academy exhibitor and member of the Society of
                                British Artists, suggests that Banes may have taken an active
                                interest in both Barrow and Blake’s works. It may be
                                significant that in his will, Henry Banes bequeathed Louisa Best
                                “pictures” (PRO PROB 11/1751).</note></p>
            <p>According to the engraving’s imprint, the publisher of

                                at Weston Place, St. Pancras, in Royal Academy exhibition catalogues
                                from 1812 to 1816 and 1823 (Graves, <hi rend="i">Royal Academy</hi>
                                1:130). In 1815 John Barrow exhibited a painting of “Mr J.
                                Barrow, Senr.” at the Royal Academy exhibition for that year
                                (Graves, <hi rend="i">Royal Academy</hi> 1:130). Therefore, it seems
                                likely that “John Barrow” was the son or nephew (and
                                quite possibly the apprentice) of “J[ohn], Barrow.” It
                                is of course possible that “John Barrow” was the
                                publisher of “Mrs Q.” However, the established link
                                between John Barrow Sr. and Blake through Henry Banes, the use of
                                the initial “I.” for “J.” in the two

                                in age, suggest that John Barrow Sr. employed Blake.</note><note id="n118">91. Graves, <hi rend="i">Royal Academy</hi> 1:130. Just
                                over two years after witnessing Henry Banes’ will, when
                                providing testimony at the proving of the will, Barrow was recorded
                                (alongside Richard Best, Louisa Best and their son Thomas) as a
                                fellow resident at 3 Fountain Court. According to his burial record,
                                Barrow, who resided at 3 Fountain Court until his death, was 81
                                years old when he was buried in St. Clement Danes’ churchyard
                                on 25 March 1838 (see COWAC, SCD 19, burial no. 1069). Therefore,
                                having been born around 1757, Barrow was an exact contemporary of

                                describes Blake when he met him in June 1818 as “having

            <p>It is intriguing to think of John Barrow, a miniature painter, first
                            employing Blake to engrave a commercial fancy print and then publishing
                            it. However, evidence suggests that Barrow was not just a miniaturist.
                            In May 1828 the 28-year-old Theodore Lane, widely regarded as a painter
                            and engraver of great promise, died when in a freak accident he fell
                            through a skylight at the horse repository in Gray’s Inn Road.
                            Three years after Lane’s death his associate, the sporting
                            journalist and author Pierce Egan, recalled that at the age of 14, Lane:
                                <q> was apprenticed to a Mr Barrow at Battle Bridge<ref target="n121" type="note">94</ref> a colourer of expensive
                                prints, and who was considered a man of ability in that line. It was
                                during his apprenticeship that Lane first displayed a taste for
                                drawing. . . . His juvenile sketches on first being shown to Mr
                                Barrow, he (Mr B.) was very much pleased with them, and in the
                                kindest manner pointed out to Theodore those defects which first
                                arise from youth and inexperience. LANE gratefully profited by his
                                instructions.<lb/> Mr Barrow saw, or thought he saw, in those early
                                sketches that sort of talent indicative of future greatness; and he
                                therefore encouraged him to proceed with the most unremitting
                                industry until he overcame all the difficulties which every artist
                                has to surmount on his first entrance into life. Mr Barrow always
                                entertained an opinion that one day or another the proud initials of
                                R.A. might be added to his name.<ref target="n122" type="note">95</ref><note id="n121">94. Battle Bridge is the former name of

                                    appears to have lived at 17 Spann’s Buildings from 1808
                                    until sometime between 1815 and 1820 (see Graves, <hi rend="i">Royal Academy</hi> 1:129-30). Lane is recorded as resident
                                    at this address in 1816 (see Graves, <hi rend="i">Royal
                                        Academy</hi> 2:381). Lane also painted a portrait of

                                    (see Graves, <hi rend="i">Royal Academy</hi> 2:381). Another
                                    apprentice of Barrow appears to have been the miniaturist E.
                                    Preston, who between 1824 and 1843 exhibited 24 portraits at the

                            colourer of expensive prints,” the profession to which
                            Barrow’s later fellow residents at 3 Fountain Court, Strand,
                            Thomas and Richard Best were apprenticed. John Barrow, print colorer and
                            miniature painter, may have been the J. Barrow who in 1782 traded as
                            printseller, publisher, and very possibly the engraver of satirical
                            prints at 11 St. Bride’s Passage, Fleet Street.<ref target="n123" type="note">96</ref> This address faced St. Bride’s Church,

                            Court, Fleet Street. It was from this address that he published a

                            As Dörrbecker suggests, such a print may have been one of the

                            indicate the likelihood that “Mrs Q” acquired radical
                            connotations absent in the majority of contemporary color-printed

                            of the middle and lower orders of British society “a symbol of
                            suffering from arbitrary power, the darling of English democrats and
                                republicans.”<ref target="n131" type="note">104</ref> George

                            adultery against his wife. The King’s more notorious extramarital
                            affairs were publicly recalled in satirical prints. For example, Harriet
                            Quentin, the wife of Colonel George Quentin of the 10<hi rend="s">th</hi> Hussars, and former mistress of George IV, was represented
                            as the infamous “Mrs Q” in numerous prints published

                                    conduct, had been progressing for some years (see Hibbert
                                    528-42). By the late spring of 1820, Caroline, provoked by the
                                    decision of her husband and the British government to exclude
                                    her from the liturgy and not to recognize her as Queen, had
                                    started on her journey from Rome back to England (Hibbert 549).
                                    Thus the likely return of the Queen must have been public
                                    knowledge for some time before she reached Dover in early June.
                                    Essick describes “Mrs Q” as executed in
                                    “Stipple etching/ engraving with mezzotint”
                                    (Essick, <hi rend="i">Separate Plates</hi> 191). In addition,
                                    much of the top half of the plate has not been engraved. If free
                                    of other work, Blake would have been able to finish such a plate
                                    relatively quickly. It is therefore possible that he was
                                    employed by Barrow to complete the stipple engraving of
                                    “Mrs Q” in the weeks preceding Caroline’s
                                    arrival in order to capitalize on the renewed topicality of the
                                    subject.
                                <p>François Huet Villiers died in late July 1813. Therefore
                                    his portrait of Harriet Quentin must have been painted at least
                                    seven years before Blake’s engraving of it (see Essick,
                                        <hi rend="i">Separate Plates</hi> 198-99). As a fellow
                                    miniature painter possibly acquainted with Villiers, Barrow may
                                    have had access to or perhaps even owned the portrait and may
                                    have regarded the approaching trial of and the widespread
                                    sympathy for the Queen as an opportunity to market an engraving
                                    of Villiers’ miniature. Whether or not this was the case,
                                    Worrall successfully demonstrates that the image was later
                                    recontextualized by radical publishers in the light of
                                    subsequent events (see Worrall). It is unclear if Blake played
                                    any part in the subsequent mezzotint engraving, printing and
                                    hand coloring of this plate. It is possible that Maile was
                                    responsible for the mezzotint work and Blake for the stipple
                                    work on both plates (see Essick, <hi rend="i">Separate

            <p>Barrow was almost certainly the designer, as well as the publisher, of

                            1 June 1821 (illus. 10).<ref target="n134" type="note">107</ref> The
                            significance of this companion print has not been explored. In 1906
                            Joseph Grego remarked, “It is regrettable that but little is
                            known to have been recorded of the charmer introduced as ‘Windsor

                            Geoffrey Keynes identified “Windsor Castle” as a portrait
                            of the Marchioness of Huntly.<ref target="n136" type="note">109</ref>
                            However, Elizabeth Henrietta Conyngham, Lady Conyngham, eldest daughter
                            of the first Marquis Conyngham, did not become the Marchioness of Huntly
                            until her marriage to Charles (Gordon), tenth Marquis of Huntly, at the
                            Royal Lodge, Windsor, on 20 March 1826.<ref target="n137" type="note">110</ref> By the early autumn of 1820, Lady Elizabeth’s

                            widespread comment.<ref target="n139" type="note">112</ref> It was even
                            suggested that the young and attractive Lady Elizabeth Conyngham was the

                            Castle” portrays young Lady Conyngham at a piano, presumably at
                            the King’s “overblown rural retreat”<ref target="n141" type="note">114</ref> (in itself a subject of
                            contemporary controversy) in Windsor Great Park. Windsor Castle is
                            visible in the background. The title of the plate may also allude to the
                            political crisis of April 1821, three months before George IV’s
                            coronation, caused by the King’s proposed appointment, without
                            government consultation, of the Rev. Charles Richard Sumner, tutor to
                            Marchioness Conyngham’s three sons, to a vacant canonry at
                            Windsor. The King’s preferment of a member of the Conyngham
                            household to such a position was widely regarded as an infringement of
                            ministers’ privileges and almost forced the resignation of Lord
                            Liverpool’s government.<ref target="n142" type="note">115</ref>
                            It seems quite possible that “Windsor Castle” could have

                                follows: “A fashionably dressed man, walking in Hyde Park,
                                draws back in astonishment on meeting Lord Conyngham, riding a

            <p>Both “Mrs Q” and “Windsor Castle” are
                            examples of the widely popular early nineteenth-century genre of the
                            commercial fancy print. These companion prints bear little resemblance
                            to the numerous political caricatures targeting George IV that
                            circulated during this period. However, both prints portray women who
                            were widely considered notorious recipients of the King’s lavish
                            favor, if not examples of his infidelities, past and present.<ref target="n143" type="note">116</ref> Significantly, John Barrow chose
                            to publish each print at a moment of political crisis early in the reign
                            of George IV. Barrow’s commission and publication of both
                            “Mrs Q” and “Windsor Castle” can therefore
                            be interpreted in the context of the widespread criticism of George
                            IV’s infidelities, extravagance and what was widely perceived as
                            the pernicious influence of members of his intimate circle.<ref target="n144" type="note">117</ref> In the light of events preceding
                            and succeeding the engraving, printing and publication of “Mrs
                            Q” and “Windsor Castle,” John Barrow and William
                            Blake can be seen, as David Worrall has suggested, as “caught up
                            . . . in the latest phase of English radical activism.”<ref target="n145" type="note">118</ref> However, although William Blake
                            was clearly the engraver of “Mrs Q,” his own opinions
                            concerning “the Queen’s affair” are unknown.
                            Bentley observes that “The Queen’s progress across France
                            to defend herself against the scandalous divorce proceedings i the House
                            of Lords was eagerly reported in <hi rend="i">The Courier</hi> and
                            elsewhere in May and June of 1820.”<ref target="n146" type="note">119</ref> However, the <hi rend="i">Courier’s</hi>

                            packet on the evening of Sunday 4 June 1820, which George Cumberland
                            read to Blake two days later at 17 South Molton Street, can hardly be
                            described as eager reporting.<ref target="n147" type="note">120</ref>
                            The writer explicitly questions Caroline’s wisdom in hastily
                            rejecting Lord Hutchinson’s proposal and Henry Brougham’s
                            advice that she should remain abroad and avoid a public trial and
                            instead choosing to return to England under the wing of the radical MP
                            Alderman Matthew Wood. “Her MAJESTY may perhaps find herself in
                            the hands of a faction to whom it is a matter of equal indifference
                            whether they celebrate their orgies under the name of Radical Reform,
                            the Manchester Massacre, or the Queen of ENGLAND.”<ref target="n148" type="note">121</ref> No record has survived of Blake
                            and Cumberland’s reaction to the <hi rend="i">Courier’s</hi> account.<ref target="n149" type="note">122</ref> In the publication of “Mrs Q” and
                            “Windsor Castle,” John Barrow appears to have expressed
                            support for Queen Caroline and criticism of George IV, sentiments held
                            by numerous working and middle class British citizens. However, although
                            his motives for engraving “Mrs Q” in 1820 are likely to
                            have been primarily commercial, Blake’s own opinions concerning
                            the return and trial of Queen Caroline remain unclear.<ref target="n150" type="note">123</ref><note id="n143">116. Although it was common practice to omit the names

                                “Mrs Q” nor “Windsor Castle” are merely
                                fancy prints, but rather explicitly make reference to contemporary

            <p>In this paper, I have discussed new information principally derived from
                            the will of Henry Banes which throws light on our knowledge and
                            understanding of the last years of William and Catherine Blake at 3
                            Fountain Court and those of Catherine Blake in widowhood. The date of
                            the commencement of Henry Banes’ period of residence at and as
                            ratepayer of 3 Fountain Court, Strand, has been established. I have
                            identified Banes’ trade and cited evidence that suggests that
                            William and Catherine Blake were not Henry and Sarah Banes’ first
                            lodgers at 3 Fountain Court. An examination of Banes’ will has
                            established the month and year of the death of Sarah Banes, the sister
                            of Catherine Blake and the wife of Henry Banes. It is now clear that
                            Sarah Banes was living at 3 Fountain Court when William and Catherine
                            Blake moved there as lodgers in 1821, but that she died approximately
                            three years later. The same source has provided the correct date for the
                            death of Henry Banes.</p>
            <p>Henry Banes’ will also reveals that, in the spring of 1829,
                            Catherine Blake almost certainly received a significant legacy. I have
                            suggested that this legacy is likely to have been an important factor in
                            Catherine’s decision to move from Frederick Tatham’s
                            residence to her own lodgings in the early spring of 1829. The will also
                            contains a brief reference to William Blake the complements other
                            contemporary allusions to Blake’s state of dress in the mid-1820s
                            and suggests a seemingly cordial relationship between Banes and his
                            brother- and sister-in-law. On the basis of evidence derived from
                            Banes’ will, I have suggested that the “sole
                            Executrix” of Banes’ estate, Louisa Best, may very well
                            have been Henry and Sarah Banes’ only surviving child. If this is
                            the case, then Louisa Best, née Banes, daughter of Sarah Banes,
                            née Boucher, is the only traced child of either William or
                            Catherine Blake’s siblings and therefore the only known niece of,
                            as well as a second traced surviving <pb id="p39-99" n="99"/> immediate
                            relative of, William and Catherine Blake.<ref target="n151" type="note">124</ref> Finally, the discovery that the miniaturist, print
                            colorer and engraver John Barrow was witness to Henry Banes’ will
                            and well acquainted with him for some years throws light upon the
                            identity and political sympathies of the publisher of Blake’s
                            “Mrs Q” and the designer and publisher of its companion
                            print “Windsor Castle.” Blake’s employment by John
                            Barrow as engraver of “Mrs Q” can also be set in a new
                            context. It is likely that Barrow’s choices of publication date
                            and subject (two attractive young women publicly associated with the
                            King’s lavish lifestyle and infidelities) of both “Mrs
                            Q” and its companion print “Windsor Castle” reflect
                            his own political opinions concerning George IV and Queen Caroline
                            during 1820 and 1821. Therefore, William Blake’s employment as
                            engraver for a publisher of John Barrow’s sympathies may indeed
                            indicate an association between Blake and radical print culture in the
                            early 1820s. However, Blake’s own motives in accepting and
                            completing this commission remain ambiguous. <note id="n151">124.
                                William Blake’s sister, Catherine Elizabeth Blake
                                (1764-1841), is the only immediate relation of William and Catherine
                                Blake known to have survived them (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2]
                                555). If Louisa was William and Catherine Blake’s niece, then
                                she as well as Catherine Elizabeth Blake had some claim on the
                                Blakes’ estate. Frederick Tatham claimed, with no
                                corroborating evidence, that Catherine Blake bequeathed “The
                                remaining stock of [Blake’s] works, still considerable . . .
                                [and] her few effects” to Mrs. Tatham and himself (Gilchrist

          <p>On 17 September 1927, the leading Blake scholar Geoffrey Keynes wrote to Eric

                        and physical relics of artists was not unknown in the 1920s. A few months

          <p>The palette, not in the catalogue, was evidently a late addition to the 1927

                        dealer Francis Harvey, who handled numerous works by Blake during the 1860s,
                        including some from the studio sale of Frederick Tatham (1805-78), another

          <p>The palette (illus. 1-2) was received in a presentation case, today labeled

                        Street/1780.” Blake submitted his entry to the Royal Academy in 1780
                        from that address,<ref target="n158" type="note">7</ref> and moved shortly
                        afterwards. Basil Long, then Keeper of Paintings at the V&amp;A, concluded

          <p>It resembles oil paint, and because of the inscribed address it has always
                        been assumed to date from c. 1780, the brief period during Blake’s

                        avoided for the rest of his life. Analysis (table 1) confirmed that it
                        includes linseed oil in many colors, poppy oil in some, and a mixture of
                        these, or possibly walnut oil, in others. These oil types are typical of
                        artists’ oil paint, both hand ground in the late eighteenth and
                        earlier nineteenth centuries, and supplied in tubes

                        the poppy oil, known to yellow less than linseed oil, was not strongly
                        associated with the white and blue paint that would have benefited most from
                        it. The variations in azelate/palmitate as well as oleate/stearate ratios
                        seen in the gas chromatography results probably stem from differential
                        drying of the paint, which was much thicker than would be found on a
                        painting. The results may also have been affected by pigment-medium
                        interactions such as the formation of zinc soaps, occasionally identified by
                        FTIR, as well as the possible addition of non-drying oils.</p>
          <p>At least one shade of yellow and one of orange lead chromate were identified
                        with optical microscopy, and supported by EDX and FTIR results. These could
                        not have been used by Blake or anyone else c. 1780. Yellow lead chromate
                        (chrome yellow) was patented in 1814, and a pale yellow shade has been found
                        in a Turner oil exhibited early that year, while the darker yellow and
                        orange shades were probably available only later, in the 1820s.<ref target="n162" type="note">11</ref> These remain the earliest occurrences
                        of lead chromate in the British collection at Tate, and in the literature on
                        British art. Zinc white was produced in a useful form for oil medium in
                        1834, the earlier variety being too transparent for the purpose.<ref target="n163" type="note">12</ref> The traditional form of Prussian

                        pigments found on the palette were available throughout Blake’s

                        1834-45 for the palette. <note id="n162">11. J. H. Townsend, “The

          <p>The connection with Harvey implies that the palette was in existence by the
                        1860s, a period when Blake had a small following, and his work fetched
                        correspondingly low prices. Nevertheless, the possibility cannot be excluded
                        that it is a deliberate fraud, of mid-nineteenth-century date. If it has a
                        genuine connection to Blake, it could have been used by one of the Ancients,
                        who had acquired it from Blake’s widow, herself an artist. Our
                        limited analyses of the paint used by Richmond and Palmer have shown that,
                        like Blake himself, they used a mixture of animal glue and plant gums in
                        their paintings during his last years, in the 1820s.<ref target="n168" type="note">17</ref> Few of their later works have been analyzed, but a
                        Richmond self-portrait of 1853 is catalogued as in oil,<ref target="n169" type="note">18</ref> so their use of this medium is possible. The only
                        certain conclusion is that the paint on the palette could not have been used
                        by William Blake. <note id="n168">17. Townsend, ed., <hi rend="i">William
