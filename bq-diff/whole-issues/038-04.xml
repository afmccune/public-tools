          <p>Once again, the marketplace offered a sufficient supply of important Blake materials to rescue this report from triviality. The blockbuster event of 2004 was the sale of the 1795 large color print (or “color-printed drawing”), <hi rend="i">The Good and Evil Angels Struggling for Possession of a Child</hi>, from the Betsey Cushing Whitney estate on 5 May at Sotheby’s New York (illus. 2). Mrs. Whitney died in March 1998; her copy of <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> (copy E) was sold at Sotheby’s New York for $2,532,500—then a record price for any work by Blake—on 23 April 1999.<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref><hi rend="i">The Good and Evil Angels</hi> is arguably the most important single pictorial work by Blake remaining in private hands, and 1 of only 3 of the large color prints still in private ownership.<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> Its sale was a much-anticipated event among Blake scholars, dealers, and collectors. <note id="n1">1. For information about copy E and illus., see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 33.4 (spring 2000): cover and 100-02, 105, 128-34, 141-43</note><note id="n2">2. The others are <hi rend="i">Lamech and His Two Wives</hi> (Butlin #298, collection of Robert N. Essick) and <hi rend="i">Naomi Entreating Ruth and Orpah to Return to the Land of Moab</hi> (Butlin #300, Keynes Family Trust). The latter is on deposit in, and destined for eventual ownership by, the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, Except for <hi rend="i">God Judging Adam</hi>, probably a relief etching, all the color prints appear to have been printed planographically from an unetched matrix, either metal or millboard.</note></p>
          <p>Blake’s color print was one of the works of art left by Mrs. Whitney to the Greentree Foundation, which she founded in 1982. The foundation was selling many of these objects, including Picasso’s <hi rend="i">Boy with a Pipe</hi> of 1905 and works by Manet, Degas, Monet, and Braque, to maintain Mrs. Whitney’s Long Island home as an international conference center and fund its educational programs. Thus, the auction situated Blake in a context in which his work had not previously been placed, accompanied by some of the most familiar names in 19<hi rend="s">th</hi>- and early 20<hi rend="s">th</hi>-century European art. Sotheby’s was clearly hoping that Blake as a pictorial artist, rather than a poet or maker of unusual books, would find a new audience at the upper reaches of the art market. Estimated at $1-1.5 million, <hi rend="i">The Good and Evil Angels</hi> was small potatoes compared to the Picasso, estimated at over $70 million.</p>
          <p>In addition to the general sale catalogue, Sotheby’s published a separate, illustrated pamphlet for the Blake lot alone. This contained a scholarly essay, not published in the general sale catalogue, by David Bindman on the large color prints. The auction began shortly after its scheduled time of 7pm to an audience of bidders and spectators of about 1200. The color print was the 5<hi rend="s">th</hi> lot out of only 34, immediately preceded by an oil painting by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot that fetched a disappointing $904,000 (inclusive of the buyer’s premium charged by Sotheby’s) on the same estimate granted the Blake. Bidding on the color print started at a modest $600,000 and quickly ran up to $800,000. After a brief pause, more bidders entered the fray and pushed the print past the estimate range. There were still 4 bidders—2 in the room, 2 on the telephones—at the $3 million mark. <hi rend="i">The Good and Evil Angels</hi> fell to one of the telephone bidders at a hammer price (the actual bid) of $3.5 million, making a total of $3,928,000 inclusive of the buyer’s premium. This figure set a new record for any work by Blake, and I believe a record for any single print by any artist. For the first time, the Blake record is held by one of his completely pictorial works rather than an illuminated book. I have not yet been able to discover the purchaser. At first I suspected that it was the American wife and husband who, over the last 2 decades, have formed the finest collection of Blake’s illuminated books in private hands. Sotheby’s tells me, however, that the purchaser was a European art collector not previously associated with Blake. The Picasso fetched $104,168,000 (inclusive of buyer’s premium) to establish a new record price for any work of art at auction.</p>
          <p>When Sotheby’s was gathering materials for the Whitney sale of 1999, the book and print departments made a thorough search for <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> copy N, last recorded in the Whitney family in 1953.<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> The volume was not found by Sotheby’s, but it has now turned up at Swann Galleries, the New York auction company. In August, a man (who remains to me unidentified) brought a copy of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> to Christine von der Linn of Swann’s book department. Its bibliographic characteristics, including the Ruse &amp; Turners 1815 watermark, identified it as copy N. According to von der Linn, the possessor (and apparent owner) of the book told her that he had acquired it from an antiques dealer who was selling the contents of a private collection unrelated to the Whitney family. This immediately raised some suspicions about the book’s post-1953 whereabouts. Fortunately, Nancy Bialler of Sotheby’s was able to contact members of the Whitney family about this matter Swann had hoped to offer the volume at an April 2005 auction, but by October 2004 it was tied up in a legal dispute over its ownership. The issue remains unresolved as of January 2005. <note id="n3">3. Geoffrey Keynes, <hi rend="i">A Bibliography of William Blake</hi> (New York: Grolier Club, 1921) 132, states that copy N (which he then designated as copy L) is “now in the possession of Mrs. H. H. Whitney [possibly Helen Hay Whitney].” Keynes and Edwin Wolf 2nd, <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Illuminated Books: A Census</hi> (New York: Grolier Club, 1953) 32, states that copy N was “later in the possession of Mrs Harry Payne Whitney, of New York, and presumably now the property of her heirs.” Bentley 476 repeats this information from Keynes and Wolf and in footnote 2 comments that “inquiries among all the surviving heirs named in her [Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney’s] will have been unsuccessful.”</note></p>
          <p>Bonhams, the London auction house, offered 47 lots of Blake or Blake-related materials, all from a private British collection, on 24 February. The sale included 18 letterpress books
<pb id="p38-125" n="125"/>
containing engravings by or after Blake, plus a set of the Job engravings; details may be found in the listings below. All lots sold at moderate prices, generally within the estimate range, perhaps in part because many of the bindings were either not contemporary or not in good condition. Several of the better works were acquired for stock by John Windle, the San Francisco book dealer who specializes in Blake and his circle.</p>
          <p>George Goyder (1908-97) is well known to Blake scholars through his association with the William Blake Trust and his collection of important pictorial works by Blake. Two tempera paintings from Goyder’s estate, <hi rend="i">The Flight into Egypt</hi> (Butlin #404) and <hi rend="i">Christ the Mediator</hi> (Butlin #429) are on long-term loan to the Tate Collection (formerly Tate Britain, formerly Tate Gallery). Three works on loan to the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, were withdrawn by the Goyder family in Feb. 2004: <hi rend="i">The Christ Child Asleep on a Cross</hi> (tempera, Butlin #410), <hi rend="i">The Fail of Fair Rosamund</hi> (pencil sketch, illus. 1), and “The Man Sweeping the Interpreter’s Parlour” (white-line metal cut). <hi rend="i">The Fall of Fair Rosamund</hi> was offered at Christie’s London on 3 June. Given the aggressive estimate of £40,000-60,000, it is not surprising that the drawing did not sell; indeed, there did not appear to be any actual bids in the room. In early July, I acquired the drawing by private treaty at substantially less than the low estimate. Other works from the Goyder collection in this auction included 3 by Samuel Palmer—see illus. 12 and the listings under Palmer below. Goyder’s impression of “The Man Sweeping the Interpreter’s Parlour” was sold at a Christie’s auction on 30 June. <hi rend="i">The Christ Child Asleep on a Cross</hi> presumably remains with the Goyder family.</p>
          <p>In <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 34.4 (spring 2001): 138-39, G. E. Bentley, Jr., announced the discovery that a plate by Blake after Stothard, previously known only in separate impressions, was published as the frontispiece to vol. 1 of [Elizabeth Blower], <hi rend="i">Maria: A Novel</hi> (1785). Thus it was with some delight that I opened Bloomsbury Book Auctions’ 17 June catalogue and found, as lot 191, a copy of Blower’s rare work. A week later, I learned from Steven Weisman of Ximenes Rare Books that the plate was not present. There was no clear evidence, such as a stub, that the frontispiece was ever in this copy, bound in contemporary calf. Bentley reports that the copy in the British Library also lacks the plate; perhaps the book was published both with and without the illustration.</p>
          <p>Scholars have long held the opinion that Henry Fuseli designed the illustrations, signed by Blake as the engraver, in two books by Charles Allen published in 1798, <hi rend="i">A New and Improved History of England</hi> and <hi rend="i">A New and Improved Roman History.</hi> We now have additional evidence for this attribution in the form of a pen and ink drawing sold by Christie’s London on 6 July. <hi rend="i">Cardinal Pandulph Granting King John Absolution</hi> (illus. 9-10), engraved by Blake as the 2<hi rend="s">nd</hi> plate in Allen’s <hi rend="i">History of England</hi> (illus. 11), bears all the hallmarks of a work by Fuseli, including the characteristic left-hand hatching strokes.<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> Further, the drawing is the “to size” preliminary used by Blake to calk and counterproof the drawing onto his copperplate—see the captions to illus. 9-11 for further explanation. This is hardly one of Fuseli’s masterpieces as a draftsman, but it offers fascinating insights into Blake’s activities as a reproductive engraver. The only other calked preliminary drawings for Blake’s etchings or engravings known to me are his own designs for Mary Wollstonecraft’s <hi rend="i">Original Stories from Real Life</hi> (1791). <note id="n4">4. Conventional, right-hand hatching rises on a diagonal from left to right. Left-hand hatching rises from right to left.</note></p>
          <p>The internet continues to transform the buying and selling of antiquarian books, as the number of “EB” and “online” offerings listed below demonstrates. I have not repeated online items previously listed in my 2002 and 2003 sales reviews, even if still available according to the dealers’ web sites.</p>
          <p>The year of all sales and catalogues in the following lists is 2004 unless indicated otherwise. The auction houses add their purchaser’s surcharge to the hammer price in their price lists. These net amounts are given here, following the official price lists. The value-added tax levied against the buyer’s surcharge in Britain is not included. Late 2004 sales will be covered in the 2005 review. For help in compiling this review I am grateful to Nancy Bialler, David Bindman, Harriet Drummond, Donald Heald, Mary Lynn Johnson, Chris Loker, Max Reed, Justin Schiller, Steven Tabor, Christine von der Linn, David Weinglass, Steven Weisman, and John Windle. My special thanks go to Alexander Gourlay for his generosity in keeping me abreast of internet auctions. Once again, Sarah Jones’ editorial expertise and John Sullivan’s electronic imaging have been invaluable.</p>

              <figure n="BUT607.1.1.PD" rend="file"><head>1. <hi rend="i">The Fall of Fair Rosamund.</hi></head><figDesc>Pencil, 31.0 × 44.0 cm. Butlin #607, where the drawing is dated to c. 1815-20. Essick collection. Jealous Queen Eleanor stands on the left and offers the kneeling Rosamond (the customary spelling), the mistress of King Henry II, a goblet of poison with which to commit penitential suicide. To enforce her demands, the Queen holds a dagger in her raised right hand. The figures far right are probably Rosamond’s attendants; they respond to the confrontation with gestures of horror and grief. Blake engraved Thomas Stothard’s “The Fall of Rosamond” in 1783. Stothard’s design, an illustration to Thomas Hull’s popular play, <hi rend="i">Henry the Second; or the Fall of Rosamond: A Tragedy</hi>, differs in many respects from Blake’s drawing, but it probably influenced Blake’s composition in the placement of the two main figures, the kneeling figures lower right, and the arches in the background (Rosamond’s “apartment” in Hull’s play, pictured as a building with an arched doorway in Stothard’s design).<lb/><lb/>
As Butlin suggests, the squiggles dangling from the Queen’s right hand and cascading behind Rosamond’s head to touch the ground probably represent the thread which, legend has it, the Queen followed to find Rosamond in her hiding place. Hull’s play makes no mention of the thread and thus it is not pictured in Stothard’s design. The unwinding of a “silken clue” (i.e., a ball of silk thread) is first mentioned in the story of Rosamond as related in Robert Fabyan’s <hi rend="i">New Chronicles of England and of France</hi> (1516). In Blake’s design, the twisted object on the ground just right of the Queen’s left foot is probably the remnants of the clue. A thread rises from it and crosses Rosamond’s upper left arm. In his <hi rend="i">Chronicles</hi> of 1577-87, Raphael Holinshed states that the silk thread was accidentally drawn out by the King’s foot when leaving Rosamond. Samuel Daniel, in his poem “The Complaint of Rosamond” (1592), claims to the contrary that the thread was purposely unraveled by Henry as a way of finding Rosamond in her labyrinth-like bower. A possible source for Blake’s knowledge of the motif is the ballad “Fair Rosamond,” now generally attributed to Thomas Deloney, as printed in <hi rend="i">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</hi>, ed. Thomas Percy (London: Dodsley, 1765) 2:133-45. Blake owned a copy of Percy’s work—see Bentley #736. In this poem, the Queen follows a “clue of twined thread” (2:143). The “clew of silk” is briefly noted (p. 61) in Charles Allen’s <hi rend="i">New and Improved History of England</hi> (1798), a book for which Blake executed engravings (see illus. 11). For a detailed study of the legend, see Virgil B. Heltzel, <hi rend="i">Fair Rosamond: A Study of the Development of a Literary Theme</hi> (Evanston: Northwestern U. Studies, 1947).<lb/><lb/>
On <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl. 57, Blake refers to “Rosamonds Bower” and asks “What is a Wife &amp; what is a Harlot? What is a Church? &amp; What / Is a Theatre?” (E 207). The following quatrain appears at the top of pl. 77:
<q>
I give you the end of a golden string,<lb/>
Only wind it into a ball:<lb/>
It will lead you in at Heavens gate,<lb/>
Built in Jerusalems wall. (E 231)
</q>
The myth of Ariadne may be the primary source for these lines, but, given the reference in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> to “Rosamonds Bower,” perhaps the unwound ball of thread in the Rosamond legend also lies behind Blake’s image of a string to be wound into a ball. Other string and thread images in the poem, including “the iron threads of love &amp; jealousy &amp; despair” (E 195), may also be related to the story of Rosamond.<lb/><lb/>
Vala is summoned to “come . . . with knife &amp; cup” in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (E 167); later, she bears “the Druid Knife of Revenge &amp; the Poison Cup / Of Jealousy” (E 214-15). Queen Eleanor is motivated by the same two passions. Vala’s confrontations with Jerusalem, the former generally aggressive and the latter passive, would also seem to participate in the same dynamic portrayed in <hi rend="i">The Fall of Fair Rosamund.</hi> Blake pictures another female with a knife in her right hand and a goblet in her left on <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl. 69, lower right. One of Blake’s early commercial copy engravings, the drawing reproduced here, and his concluding epic are intertwined in multiple ways.</figDesc></figure>

              <figDesc>Planographic color print finished in pen and ink and water colors, 43.8 × 58.5 cm., composed and probably printed in 1795. Butlin #324. Photo courtesy of Sotheby’s New York.<lb/><lb/>
Blake called the impression of this print now in the Tate Collection (Butlin #323) “Good &amp; Evil Angel” in his accounts with Thomas Butts of 5 July 1805 (see G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, 2<hi rend="s">nd</hi> ed. [New Haven and London: Yale UP, 2004] 764). The first appearance of the same basic design on pl. 4 of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> (1790) offers a textual context for interpreting the iconography of the image. On the previous pl., Blake writes of the fundamental contraries of human existence, from which “spring what the religious call Good &amp; Evil” (E 34). On pl. 4, “The voice of the Devil” speaks of several “Errors,” including the association of “Evil” with “Energy” and the “Body,” and “Good” with “Reason” and “the Soul” (E 34). The design may be a similar perspective on the projection of mental errors into an external reality, with the child representing humanity struggling within a dualistic universe. The shackle and chain on the ankle of the figure on the left—presumably the “evil” angel—adds further complexities. His energies (or desires) have already been restrained. As we learn on pl. 5 of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>, “the restrainer or reason usurps its [desire’s] place &amp; governs the unwilling” (E 34). Beginning with copy E of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>, printed c. 1794-95, and extending through all later printings, Blake added the shackle and chain to the design on pl. 4. The flames behind the shackled figure can be interpreted from two perspectives, one that views fire as hellish “torment” enforced by a punishing “God” (E 34), and one that views fire as “the enjoyments of Genius” (E 35). See also the discussion in the essay introductory to this sales review.</figDesc>

A pencil sketch for pl. 5 in <hi rend="i">The Gates of Paradise</hi> appears on p. 93 of Blake’s Notebook.

Since Urizen seeks “For a solid without fluctuation” in <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> (E 71), the possible influence of Basire’s pl. on the portrayal of Urizen on pl. 9 offers an ironic progenitor in a picture of a solid <hi rend="i">with</hi> fluctuation.

Many lines have been incised, very probably by Blake, for transfer (or “calking”) onto another sheet of paper. Blake used a surprisingly sharp instrument to incise the drawing, one that cut into (but not through) the paper. Fragments of graphite associated with a few of the incised lines suggest that he may have used a sharp pencil. See illus. 10 for the verso and illus. 11 for the engraving.</figDesc>

Blake has rubbed black chalk (or possibly very soft graphite) over the verso of the drawing so that it could be calked (see illus. 9) on to another piece of paper. Fragments of this second sheet can be seen in each corner of the verso of Fuseli’s drawing where Blake glued the two sheets together. The calked lines from the recto, visible on the verso as slightly raised lines, were transferred in chalk or graphite to the second sheet, which in turn was transferred (or “counterproofed”) face down onto the etching ground on the copperplate. This two-step process of calking and counterproofing preserved the right/left orientation of the original drawing and converted it into a medium that could be readily transferred to the etching ground on a copperplate.</figDesc>

Pls. 1 and 4 are based on designs by Daniel Nikolaus Chodowiecki. Pls. 1, 3, and 4 very probably had their immediate models in the pls. engraved by Johann Rudolf Schellenberg (pl. 1) and an unknown engraver or engravers (pls. 3, 4) published in Lavater, <hi rend="i">Essai sur la physiognomonie</hi>, The Hague, vol. 1 [1781]. Johnson has very kindly told me in correspondence that Blake’s pl. 2, “Democritus” after Rubens, probably also had its immediate model in the engraving by Johann Heinrich Lips published in vol. 1 of the <hi rend="i">Essai</hi>, although Blake’s handling of the image may have been influenced by Vorsterman’s engraving noted in <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations</hi>, p. 42.</p>

The existence of this drawing, the only one traced for the 4 pls. in Allen’s <hi rend="i">History of England</hi> and the 4 in his <hi rend="i">Roman History</hi> (1798), supports the long-held opinion that all 8 pls. were designed by Fuseli.

          <p>Best about this collection is its targeting of readers starting serious study of Blake. The aim has encouraged most contributors to focus on fundamental problems <hi rend="i">as</hi> difficult problems. The results are of value equally to beginners and antiques like me who’ve been delightedly struggling with Blake’s mind-expanding art for half a century. A few essayists lose track of the volume’s orientation. Saree Makdisi unfortunately doesn’t follow his own good insight that Blake’s work should inspire us to unlearn “whatever it is that makes us ‘learned’” (111). In “The Political Aesthetic of Blake’s Images,” Makdisi wanders into a dark wood of conventionalities about the relation of poetry to graphic images, committing the commonest sin of recent criticism, citation of secondary sources without assessment of <hi rend="i">their</hi> sources or reliability (e.g., 132n9). Susan Wolfson, in “Blake’s Language in Poetic Form,” slides into analyses of <hi rend="i">Poetic Sketches</hi> which may baffle beginners, particularly because this seems a retreat from justifying her claim that the poetics of the later <hi rend="i">French Revolution</hi> opened “a revolutionary path from which Blake would never really retreat” (64). Analyzing technicalities of poetics is never easy, but Wolfson’s blasts of details (in which Blake’s peculiar efficacy with trochaic and anapaestic meters gets missed) are off-putting.</p>
          <p>Eaves provides an introductory essay that is admirable in its refusal to oversimplify, while defining lucidly what makes Blake’s difficulties exciting to study. Illustrative is Eaves’ observation that Blake’s rise beyond aesthetic respectability to celebrity was facilitated by publication of his verse stripped of its graphic contexts, contexts which now are the principal focus of serious study of his work. Developing such historical ironies and never evading the continuous emergence of contradictions of every kind in both Blake’s work and its critiques, Eaves convincingly presents the artist’s oeuvre as simultaneously resistant and accessible, finally suggesting in the tradition of Frye that what Blake offers is “Not freakish nor unique . . . but the epitome of reading itself” (13). This leads to a sound recommendation to cultivate “the attitudes suggested by Coleridge’s ‘suspension of disbelief’ and Keats’s ‘negative capability’—strong openness to new artistic experiences, unbiased by prior commitments”(15).</p>
          <p>Aileen Ward follows with attractive comments on “William Blake and His Circle” which better than most full-scale biographies evoke a sense for Blake as a social being. She introduces one of the most praiseworthy features of this collection, that it does not slight the later years of Blake’s life, doing justice to the satisfactions of the final decade under the sponsorship of Linnell and the esteem of younger artists. One should read Ward’s essay along with Jon Mee’s “Blake’s Politics in History” later in the volume; Mee intelligently and helpfully describes the political side of Blake’s social life which is of secondary interest to Ward. The essays together evoke a strong sense of Blake’s sociable inclinations.</p>
          <p>Joe Viscomi ingeniously begins his essay on the “Illuminated Printing” at the end of Blake’s life with his work on the <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings, then sweeps backward to condense into 25 pages an astonishingly accessible summary of the detailed and complex scholarship by which he has changed our thinking of how and why Blake divided sheets of copper, engraved, etched, wrote, printed, and colored as he did—hand labor creating imaginative works that stagger the imagination. This essay alone makes the <hi rend="i">Companion</hi> worth the purchase price, because it provides a beginner with a clear understanding of Blake’s working methods on which today all responsible scholars must found their critical interpretations. It also provides the basic information needed to begin to make effective use of the William Blake Archive on the internet. This extraordinary resource, for which Viscomi, Robert Essick, and Eaves are primarily responsible, is not adequately highlighted by the <hi rend="i">Companion</hi> (media competition?). The Archive makes possible rapid, efficient, and inexpensive research into Blake by inquirers of whatever level of training and expertise. It is a godsend for the specialist, particularly one who is comparing illuminated texts, and it can be explosively exciting for undergraduates, not merely in empowering their engagement with Blake but also in enabling them to experience firsthand the pleasures of detailed humanistic research.</p>
          <p>David Bindman handles with tact and good sense the essentially frustrating subject of “Blake as a Painter,” in part because he understands (as most literary critics do not) that Blake’s refusal to paint in oils made him in his own day and ours a pariah in the art (and art history) establishment—along with the host of English watercolorists of his era who created one of the great “schools” of Western art, still ignored by art historians who prefer to enthuse murkily over fourth-rate oil painters. This makes Bindman’s praise of the unfinished watercolor series on Dante especially cogent:
<q>
The demands of illustrating Dante are enormous, given the intricacy and profusion of his imagery, and the importance of physical atmosphere, but Blake does more than fulfill those demands. For each completed image in the series, and this applies just as forcefully to the biblical watercolors and those to Milton, is itself a history painting that would be persuasive on any scale, despite the “low” medium of watercolor. (108)
</q></p>
          <pb id="p38-152" n="152"/>
          <p>Most welcome is Robert Ryan’s sensible and historically sound contribution on “Blake and Religion.” Most welcome, because religion is too seldom mentioned by others in this volume, although it was the central subject of every one of Blake’s prophecies. (I was surprised by another interest of Blake’s that goes virtually unmentioned here, sex—but maybe I’m just a dirty old man.) Ryan’s focus on Blake’s de-mythologizing and his consistent attacks on the “pretence of Religion to destroy Religion” is salutary. Any judgment of Blake’s politics is inadequate unless it takes account of their religious component. Ryan rightly identifies the crux of these as the relations between Jesus and imagination—I say rightly not because of my infinite wisdom but because that has been the focal point in Blake’s work for serious twentieth-century theologians.</p>
          <p>The final section on specific works generally sustains the high level of the opening portions of the <hi rend="i">Companion.</hi> Nelson Hilton deals intelligently, perceptively and judiciously with all the early works, moving quickly but easily, never forcing even his best interpretations—so I think a beginner would find them all helpful for getting into the poems in his or her own fashion. Too little contemporary criticism is useful in this generous way. Hilton keeps the chronologies straight without fussiness, and supplies minimal context with fine tact—bringing it to bear only when it is needed. Andrew Lincoln is less successful at the daunting task of dealing with the prophecies “From <hi rend="i">America</hi> to <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi>” Although he makes some useful observations, for example, that few “works in English can express a more powerful sense of the body’s capacity for pain” than <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (217), Lincoln’s understanding sometimes skids along the surface to become misleading. Blake’s associating of “liberty with increased ‘sensual enjoyment’” is fundamental, not, as Lincoln implies, a mere borrowing from Swedenborg (212). On 219 he seems to suggest that Blake “associates sexuality—and especially female sexuality—with evil.” I think (and hope) Lincoln means that this is the false myth that Blake attacks, but I doubt that a newcomer to the prophecies could deduce that meaning from his prose. Whether it was Lincoln’s own choice or an editorial decision, trying to pack criticism of so

many difficult works into a scant twenty pages was unwise. I observe in passing that, although the <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> (a favorite of mine) supplies the picture for the front cover of the <hi rend="i">Companion</hi>, it receives minimal attention, outside of a paragraph from Ryan and another from Hilton.</p>
          <p>Robert Essick’s “<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and Blake’s Final Works” provides an excellent introduction to that last vast prophecy by neither reducing it to an interpretation nor fitting it into a convenient ideological scheme but accepting that in the poem “Blake questions the very grounds of understanding—not just of his work, but of the world” (252). This appropriately links <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> back to <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, which tells us dogmatically to disbelieve any dogmatic statement. Having asserted that in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> “Every word and every letter is studied and put into its fit place,” Blake went merrily ahead to rearrange the sequence of plates in the final two copies of the poem he collated. Elucidating the poem’s dynamic form through attention to recurrent minute particulars, Essick traces one of its crucial metonymic “image clusters” of fibers and threads, which leads to his insight that this “image field” has a disconcerting “tendency to convert its terms into the vehicles of metaphors.” So much for Roman Jakobson. Essick is persuasive in demonstrating that the prophecy’s contradictions interestingly fulfill the “tendency of fixed structures . . . to become mobile evolv[ing] into a visionary physics based on space-bending, dimension-multiplying processes”(262).</p>
          <p>Even more valuable is his recognition that if <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> “is Blake’s greatest achievement in the illuminated epic” (265), it did not conclude his career as an artist. Essick describes cogently Blake’s later work, including the visionary heads, the marvelous miniature wood engravings for Philips’ <hi rend="i">Imitation of Eclogue I</hi>, the illustrations for the <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy</hi> and <hi rend="i">Job</hi>, concluding with the <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> engraving. As with other essays in this volume, the reader is provided with a sense for the full reach and span of Blake’s career—a rarity in recent criticism.</p>
          <p>Mary Lynn Johnson’s “<hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and Its Contexts” is the best brief essay I’ve encountered on what I regard as Blake’s most difficult prophecy. Much of her success comes from flinging
<pb id="p38-153" n="153"/>
herself into the fearful symmetries of the text with the enthusiasm of a beginner, even though she brings to her task broad knowledge and long experience of grappling with mind-boggling minute particulars of Blake’s artistry. While accompanying new readers into the poem to enjoy “find[ing] themselves clueless <hi rend="i">in medias res</hi>, thrown back on their own resources, as if subjected to a wilderness-survival test” (231), she points out exciting features of this strange terrain: for example, that <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> is perhaps unique in presenting a “poet as protagonist and title character. In European literature there are parallels of sorts, but no precedents” (231). She links the poem to earlier works such as <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> and Blake’s biography—noting, for example, that his “all-out commitment to artistic independence upon returning to London in 1803” led to a “precipitous drop, after 1806, in commercial employment and an astonishing upsurge in creative productivity” (235). She skillfully elucidates the poem’s relation to <hi rend="i">Paradise Regained</hi> and displays how it is built upon informed challenges to major theological doctrines of atonement and salvation, in particular Calvinist predestination. These are issues of interest to few readers today, but Johnson enables us to grasp their role in Blake’s strange structuring of his brief epic that develops his essential insight of <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> as less “a prophecy of liberation” than a “‘history’ of the restraint of desire” (234), and why that insight has relevance not only to social, political, and ethical concerns of Blake’s time but even to our own. She understands, as few recent literary critics seem to, that Blake’s purpose really was “to change lives, so that through those changed lives a nation and a world may be redeemed” (247). This is why his “self-representation as a prophetic visionary is more than a rhetorical device eliciting ordinary literary-critical responses.” As she rightly observes, “we resist poetry that, in Keats’s words, ‘has a palpable design on us,’ especially—in an academic setting—words of ‘eternal salvation.’” But we can only understand <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> if we are willing “to suspend disbelief in the soul-saving rhetoric of lower-class evangelistic Protestantism” (247). So she judges that
<q>
Blake paid a high personal price for his Decade-of-Milton achievements. Yet in choosing Art over Mammon, he made an excellent bargain. To the adoring young artists who brightened his impoverished later years, he was a model of cheerful industry; and he died . . . singing songs of his own composition, with the light of vision burning in his eyes. To seek that inspiration, even today, is the best reason for reading Blake at all. (247-48)
</q></p>
          <p>The sequence of my remarks reverses the book’s proper ordering of Essick’s and Johnson’s essays because her style and angle of attack better introduce my comments on David Simpson’s essay “Blake and Romanticism,” which focuses on Blake’s place in academic criticism of romanticism of the past sixty years. Ironically, by its very judicious intelligence (and many shrewd and thoughtful observations), Simpson’s essay occasionally obscures what are to me (who was very much engaged in the event) some significant features in the history of Blake’s emergence as a major figure of romanticism. These issues are too big for a review, and perhaps I can later in this journal or elsewhere offer the fuller commentary that Simpson’s valuable article deserves. Here I suggest its importance by indicating summarily aspects of it that to me especially call for some qualification or extended development.</p>
          <p>Simpson is I think mistaken in suggesting that before the late 1950s Blake was one of the six major romantic figures. Although the books of Frye and Erdman gave crucial boosts to interest in Blake, he was rarely included in university courses on romanticism, especially in Ivy League institutions, and never taught in high schools until the sixties. The first graduate seminar in Blake at the University of Wisconsin was I believe offered by me at the beginning of the sixties (followed by the first and only graduate seminar offered anywhere on Blake and Jane Austen, the first writers to make internalization their central concern). In fact, the conventional romantic gang of six Simpson claims for the early fifties was then really three, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, with grudging admissions that Shelley had participated. Byron was almost as ignored as Blake, although his worldwide fame and influence (he remains the only British poet besides Shakespeare generally known outside the anglophone world), and the never-flagging fascination with his life, producing about a biography a year since his death, required dismissive comment—much of it, like that of Abrams and Bloom, ludicrous. The only biographer fifty years ago who had dug out the truth about Byron, Leslie Marchand, was prevented from publishing it by descendants of John Murray (publisher’s revenge!). Most interestingly, when Marchand began in the sixties spilling the beans about Lord B’s multiple sexuality (bi- seems inadequate; as Carl Woodring put it, you might think twice about asking him to hold your horse), nobody was much interested—we hadn’t yet begun stripping for the action of <hi rend="i">our</hi> sexual revolution. (Some British scholars still seem antsy about Byron’s sexual vitality.) The modern critical reputations of Blake and Byron are mutually illuminating—as Blake foresaw in his <hi rend="i">Death of Abel</hi>, recognizing in <hi rend="i">Cain</hi> of 1822 (the fulcrum on which <hi rend="i">Don Juan</hi> pivots) a parallel contempt for a pretense of religion to destroy religion that animates his <hi rend="i">Milton.</hi></p>
          <p>Blake in fact became a canonized member of the romantic politburo in the twentieth century before Byron, although official recognition did not come (after some hard fighting) until his first inclusion in the MLA volume <hi rend="i">The English Romantic Poets: A Review of Research</hi>, 4<hi rend="s">th</hi> edition (1985—mostly completed two years earlier). The complexity involved in the reconfiguring around 1960 of who was a big-wheel romantic poet requires extended elucidating, but one feature is suggested by prime movers in the Blake explosion being Northrop Frye, David Erdman, and Harold Bloom. I would be hard pressed to name three individuals more distinct in background, personality, and critical orientation, yet they were united by revolutionary fervor—Erdman’s edition superseding
<pb id="p38-154" n="154"/>
Keynes’, for example, could accommodate Bloom’s interpretive commentaries. Each was (and Bloom still is) an enthusiast. And their enthusiasm is not to be separated from their strong responsiveness toward the religious. Frye was ordained as what I would call a protestant and what Simpson would call a dissenting minister. Bloom had no need of such entitlement, since his voice has always been difficult to distinguish from Yahweh’s own. Erdman might be called anti-Christian, since he was an engaged leftist (unlike baby-boomer theoretical Marxists), one who suffered professionally and financially for practicing his convictions. In the light of his ultimate fascination with Blakean texts, his most intriguing publication was a pamphlet he wrote for labor organizers on how to set up a printing press.</p>
          <p>Erdman reminds us that a deep concern with religion does not require one to be either a believer or a communicant—witness Voltaire, or Byron, Shelley, and Keats, and I think an enthusiasm entwined with sensitivity to religious impulses fired the romantic criticism which morphed Blake into a major poet. Simpson is correct that Frye’s 1947 <hi rend="i">Fearful Symmetry</hi> and Bloom’s subsequent <hi rend="i">Blake’s Apocalypse</hi> present Blake’s art as transcending historical periodizing, offering insight into transhistorical “poetic genius.” Blake released in both Frye and Bloom their full power as critics. Such responsiveness was typical in their time. David Erdman found in Blake a means to realize his oddly organized/disorganized talents as his political commitments had not permitted. Study of Blake’s art demands finally scholarship, not mere criticism. And Erdman was the first significantly to link Blake to American literature and politics of his time, into which, as Tom Paine illustrates, religion, pro or con, invariably intruded. Most of us who were graduate students and young faculty in those years were enthused; we had a gospel Simpson misses: to overthrow the evil critical empire of academically entrenched modernism. Our enemies were Eliot, Pound, and Ransom-Tate conservatives, all Babbitts (the Harvard species, but Irving is the flip side of Sinclair Lewis’ unintellectual protagonist). We reacted against the modernists’ reaction against what they called romanticism, which we regarded (correctly, it so happens) as a factitious falsification. In so doing, although we were not aware of it, we were originating post-modernism—whose self-conscious beginnings at the same moment are now always identified with architects of the early sixties like Philip Johnson.</p>
          <p>Simpson is right to puzzle over whether romanticists of that era were focused on the 1789-1832 period or with a conception of romanticism as articulating something fundamental to the “poetic spirit.” We were doing both—seeing in the transient moment of English romanticism an historical revelation of the imaginative potency all true poetry releases. Hence criticism of that era is marked by the kind of exuberance displayed by Mary Lynn Johnson in her essay on <hi rend="i">Milton.</hi> The notable absence of such exuberance from criticism of the past two decades may be connected to the loss of interest in impulses that animate religiosity. Deconstructionists, New Historicists, et al. do not take seriously (as my generation did) Blake’s claim that religion originates in poetic imagining. The claim parallels young Wordsworth’s subtler argument for the foundation of spiritual impulses in reciprocal engagements with our natural environment—what is offered, for example, by a vernal wood. Our concern was more than compatible with intense skepticism, as it had been for Byron, Shelley, and Keats (and Germany’s great romantic, Kleist, Paul de Man’s secret idol). This was the foundation for our understanding of romantic self-reflexivity: by rigorously applying skepticism to itself one uncovers unappreciated powers of the human mind.</p>
          <p>Parallelism between the later romantics and Blake is remarkable, as is revealed by the late fascination of all three with Dante, and their astonishingly penetrating insights into his achievements—far beyond Eliot’s superficial comments. Blake has none of Shelley’s superb <hi rend="i">terza rima</hi>, nor Byron’s grasp of Dante’s socio-historical situation, but his illustrations are theologically acute. That perspicacity is relevant to his ascension in the sixties, when of course there was much false and silly vaporizing about “spirituality,” but also some valuable analyses by theologically informed scholars, such as Altizer—not inappropriately, since the hermeneutics fundamental to all modern criticism (even McGann’s) originated in romantic Protestant biblical studies. Protestantism may explain why Blake’s literary canonizing was mainly the work of North Americans. English contributions have been secondary and derivative—a reminder that since the death of Byron and Blake the most significant poets in the anglophone tradition from Whitman and Dickinson to Walcott have not been English: the literary empire was the first to crumble.</p>
          <p>I hope these personal comments on Simpson’s excellent article suggest the most attractive aspect of the <hi rend="i">Companion</hi> as a whole: it proves that much is still to be explored in Blake’s art, and that directly confronting its difficulties is the best way to experience the uniqueness of his exhilarating prophetic accomplishments.</p>

          <p>John Pierce’s latest book, an attempt to combine poststructuralist readings of Blake’s texts with new bibliographical studies of the variant copies of those texts, offers a grammatological study of writing in a tradition that (he claims) extends back to the late seventeenth century and which has more recently been theorized by Walter Ong, Henri-Jean Martin and Nicholas Hudson as well as, of course, Derrida. In his introduction, Pierce posits a distinction in Blake between those approaches that concentrate on the material text of Blake’s works where the material object is not always theorized, and those which pursue a highly theorized approach (for example in the work of Peter Otto, Molly Anne Rothenberg, Donald Ault and others) that does not always incorporate the material object into that study. As ever with such generalizations, it is easy to point out a few instances where the material object <hi rend="i">is</hi> theorized, notably in the work of Eaves, Viscomi and Essick, while Pierce himself points out the importance of Vogler’s and Hilton’s <hi rend="i">Unnam’d Forms</hi> to his book. In addition, the easy binary between material object and theoretical rereading that he offers at the beginning of <hi rend="i">The Wond’rous Art</hi> (an opposition that will be wonderfully synthesized by his deconstruction) is more fragile at the beginning of the twenty-first century than he would lead the unsuspecting reader to believe. After all, using Derrida to destabilize the apocalyptic model offered by Frye and Bloom is itself hardly new, particularly for those who were first introduced to Blake studies in the eighties.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, Pierce’s observation that Blake is being recovered as a prophet of <hi rend="i">écriture</hi> via publications such as the Blake Trust/Tate Gallery edition of Blake’s illuminated books and the online Blake Archive is a useful one. He is also concerned with the ways in which Blake engages with writing not simply as process but also as illumination via rereading of the past: “Keeping in mind that Blake is an interpreter of Milton, the Bible, Bunyan, a host of others and also of himself, we can see that his work evinces this dual experience [of simultaneous writing and interpretation]” (14). Pierce points out several times that writing is invested with a “remarkable degree” of significance in Blake’s texts; in turn, Blake’s writing itself is interpreted by critics in multiple ways, for example the elevation of the bardic writer, Blake’s own involvement in the production of his books, or via an examination of graphic technologies. Pierce is primarily concerned with writing as a thematic concern, that is how the act of writing is represented, how it functions as a form of communication, and finally as the theoretical site of signification. These are presented by Pierce within a fairly straightforward post-structuralist framework in which Derrida is most important, followed by Foucault and Barthes.</p>
          <p>The “wond’rous art” is a phrase from <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> that Pierce interprets as referring to the “two principal functions—mediation and communication” offered by writing (38). In an initial contextual and theoretical section on these “scenes of writing,” we see the ways in which writing could be seen as mediating the divine or, by contrast, as an entirely human and rationalistic progression of civilization that was ultimately democratic and demystifying. Blake, it is perhaps unsurprising to discover, arbitrates between the two, appreciating attacks on the social inequalities of priestcraft while not agreeing with the Enlightenment removal of the divine from writing. In addition to this intervention between divine imagination and human reason, the “wond’rous art” also mediates between speech and writing, which Pierce frames as part of a very familiar Enlightenment and Romantic debate regarding the nature of voice and writing. To be honest, the contextualization offered in this section is weak and compares unfavorably with Essick’s <hi rend="i">William Blake and the Language of Adam.</hi><ref target="n5" type="note">1</ref> Pierce is on surer ground when he turns to the actual practice of providing deconstructive readings of his chosen texts. Thus, for example, while I am not entirely sure what he means when he says of the “Introduction” to <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> that it “laughs the whole conceptual system of logocentrism into a state of suspension” (48), his comment alludes to some of the playfulness rather than pomposity of post-structuralist reading that is perhaps closer to Barthes at his most impish. <note id="n5">1. Robert N. Essick, <hi rend="i">William Blake and the Language of Adam</hi> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989). While Pierce refers to Essick several times, his main interest appears to be in Essick’s work on Blake as a printmaker; while in itself this is probably a just assessment, <hi rend="i">William Blake and the Language of Adam</hi> covered similar ground to this section of <hi rend="i">The Wond’rous Art</hi> with generally more fruitful results—primarily because Essick is so conscious of the wider historical context in which Blake’s ideas were operating.</note></p>
          <p>These theoretical and contextual chapters of <hi rend="i">The Wond’rous Art</hi> are followed by a section on narrative in which Pierce attempts to outline how tensions operate in narrative between a move towards cohesive completeness and individual elements that disrupt or decay that closure. This point has been made many times before, perhaps most forcefully in Morris Eaves’s “On Blakes We Want and Blakes We Don’t,” where Eaves observes that he has as often failed to find narrative “supportsystems” in Blake’s prophecies: “my best reasons for believing that there is a system that can really be understood come from the secondhand testimony of great systematizing critics like Frye. Personally I have never experienced the grasp of Blake’s meaning to which they . . . have so eloquently testified.”<ref target="n6" type="note">2</ref> Pierce’s argument that Blake may be deliberately exploiting incoherencies within a narrative support-system is more appropriate to the shorter Continental Prophecies than the later
<pb id="p38-156" n="156"/>
prophecies, because these earlier texts do appear to have been arranged according to some sort of formal structure that repeats properties (names, lines, physical format and such like) at the same time that those texts challenge simple attempts to read a unified narrative. Thus <hi rend="i">America</hi> followed by <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, with <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> as a framing sequence of events, does indeed appear to indicate a narrative of closure. Yet working out a coherent temporal framework in these prophecies (from prehistory to apocalypse) is extremely difficult, with events in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> not simply following those of <hi rend="i">America</hi> but also paralleling, preceding and retelling the conflict of the earlier story. This is one of the reasons, for example, why Makdisi labels Blake’s work in the 1790s as an impossible history, “challenging the sense of linear flow” that saw a progress of liberty from Britain to America.<ref target="n7" type="note">3</ref> It is right, therefore, if not exactly radical, to state that narrative frameworks in the short prophecies are always provisional, always complicated. More usefully, Pierce offers a clear explication of this process at work, and is particularly interesting (following McGann) when discussing how the visual narrative of <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> and the frontispieces of the Continental Prophecies encode the reader’s own struggles with enslavement and redemption, blindness and insight, as we move from Urizen’s fearful contemplation of shadowy forms to the rest and recuperation of Los after his labors. Pierce also has some pertinent points to make when reading <hi rend="i">The [First] Book of Urizen</hi> as a Blakean text that is not only concerned with books and writing, but which also offers an almost post-structuralist autocritique of its own systems and status. At its most basic, this is effected by the book’s resistance to the basic determinants of the book form, with each extant copy offering alternative plate orders, but Pierce’s argument also extends to theoretical and thematic representations of writing within the text. Detailed readings of copies C and A, for example, with reference to other copies printed in 1794, undermine the notion of the “ideal” scholarly text. <note id="n6">2. Morris Eaves, “On Blakes We Want and Blakes We Don’t,” <hi rend="i">William Blake: Images and Texts</hi>, ed. Robert Essick (San Marino, CA: Huntington Library, 1997) 137-64 (142).</note><note id="n7">3. Saree Makdisi, <hi rend="i">William Blake and the Impossible History of the 1790s</hi> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003) 155.</note></p>
          <p>What we have, then, and this is Pierce’s most intriguing assertion at this point, is a “torn book,” the sacred text deliberately violated as befits the Bible of Hell. Again, it would be ingenious to claim complete originality for the methodology being pursued here, and Pierce himself credits the most important and innovative insights to various sources such as the Santa Cruz Blake Study Group and Viscomi. What <hi rend="i">Wond’rous Art</hi> does is to tease interesting potential from the new bibliography. It is not clear, however, that he has drawn on Thomas Vogler’s rather severe criticism of his previous book, that (with reference to Viscomi) “<hi rend="i">meaningful</hi> differences between the works must be understood at the level of <hi rend="i">editions</hi> rather than—with rare exceptions—of the individual copy.”<ref target="n8" type="note">4</ref> While <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> could be considered one of those rare exceptions, the main thrust of Vogler’s criticism here is that it is questionable as to whether Blake ever willfully produced variants within editions to make each copy unique, or that such variations represented a conscious rebellion against “engraving uniformity.” The “torn book” is a fascinating working hypothesis—but it is no more than that, and recognition of the tentative nature of the hypothesis undermines Pierce’s confident declaration that “As we turn to other copies of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> and subject them to the kind of scrutiny provided by the perspective of the torn book, we find different patterns designed to suggest the order, design, and structure of the sacred book, but disrupted enough to undermine complete closure” (101). The key phrase here is “we find”: in terms of a reception theory that concentrates on the social, indeed, infernal, illumination offered to and by the active reader (which would accord with Pierce’s arguments about Blake’s rereading and rewriting of Milton, Bunyan, the Bible and others), the motif of the torn book is an extremely interesting premise; unfortunately, within a paragraph or two we return to declarations such as “Blake offers a minor disruption to the narrative continuity of the plates,” leading us to suspect that we “find” what Blake intentionally left in the text for us to discover. <note id="n8">4.

Pierce, <hi rend="i">Flexible Design: Revisionary Poetics in Blake’s</hi> Vala <hi rend="i">or</hi> The Four Zoas, in <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> 33.2 (fall 1999): 51-62 (54).</note></p>
          <p>The final part of the book, “Re-Writing,” offers some of Pierce’s most sophisticated readings, with particular regard to <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> and <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (though, surprisingly, not <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>). The problem of studying the manuscript of <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> or <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> is familiar territory, being in part a return to his arguments around narrative experiment in <hi rend="i">Flexible Design.</hi><ref target="n9" type="note">5</ref> Central to this argument is an extended application of Foucault’s notion of archaeology, mediated through De Quincey’s description of the palimpsest in <hi rend="i">Suspiria de Profundis</hi> and Derrida’s reading of Freud’s essay on the Mystic Writing Pad. With regard to post-structuralist examinations of texts and textuality, we are on familiar ground—but the obvious appeal of Blake’s unfinished epic as palimpsest offers Pierce plenty of opportunities to discover the strata of the archaeology of the poem, how the writing and editing of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> immediately resists a drive towards a “law of coherence,” a drive that Pierce finds in readings offered by Brian Wilkie and Mary Lynn Johnson, Anthony Rosso and even Ault (although he does not appear to be aware of, and certainly does not cite, Peter Otto’s recent book, <hi rend="i">Blake’s Critique of Transcendence</hi>, which shares similar deconstructive concerns when reading <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>).<ref target="n10" type="note">6</ref> Once again, the methodology is a familiar one, but Pierce’s critical readings repeatedly offer illuminating interpretive judgments into this “space of writing,” as when he concentrates on page 99 of the original manuscript to demonstrate how the “archaeology of writing here reveals writing’s capacity to preserve underlying layers while actively receiving
<pb id="p38-157" n="157"/>
new models of ‘Divine Vision.’ These pages seem to record and receive without ever exhausting the dream of presence” (120). Pierce’s detailed reading reinvigorated my own interest in the frequently incoherent and fragmentary—yet fascinating—text of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> While I am frequently nonplussed by Pierce’s claims that he is pushing new theoretical ground with regard to Blake, he can use that theory to draw attention to intriguing details in the text. For example, his comments on how explicitly Christian imagery is added during a later redaction of the text, which indicates some of the sedimentation and striation of Blake’s mythological imagination, or how the appearance of the Council of God creates similar problems for a notional narrative and thematic unity of the text, are genuinely useful insights. These are absorbing examples of Pierce’s archaeological “dig” performed on a poem that is often literally written under erasure. <note id="n9">5. John B.

          <p>The final chapter on <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> is less inspiring overall as it returns to some of the thematic and formal ideas examined earlier in the book (and is thus something of a disappointment after the experimental palimpsest of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>). Pierce’s claim early in the chapter, following Wittreich, that he is less concerned with Milton the man than in Milton refracted through eighteenth-century commentators, and that “the Milton of the poem is a discursive field rather than a representation of a historical personage” (131), can be frustrating. The rewriting of Milton, and Blake’s contribution to that “discursive field,” is potentially fascinating, yet Pierce’s contextualization of such a field is too brief and sketchy to be convincing. Certainly there are other writers, such as Wittreich and Lucy Newlyn, who provide much more detailed analysis of Milton’s contribution to Romanticism, and Pierce’s discussion of the archive around this particular discursive field is far too paltry. Towards the end of the chapter we are presented with a page on Addison’s rereading of Milton as an inveterate classicist (hence Blake’s disgust at subservience to “Greek or Roman models”), with a nod towards Dryden and John Dennis. While the general point made by Pierce at this juncture is a fair one, that Blake was on the attack against a tendency by certain writers in the eighteenth century to judge contemporary poetry by its conformity to abstract rules, the evidence he offers here is simply too meager. Milton was not as thoroughly depoliticized as the example of Addison suggests, even in the eighteenth century; Samuel Johnson and John Toland, at different times and for extremely different purposes, attacked or invoked Milton in support of their own political positions. Even if we restrict ourselves to aesthetic theory, however, subtly different readings of Milton were available to Blake as part of the “series of discursive fields” surrounding the poet, such as the representation of Milton as a bardic, even mystical, poet of imagination in Collins’s “Ode on the Poetical Character.” Despite such frustrations, however, this chapter does have plenty of its own insights, most notable of which for me was the discussion of Los’s printing press as not merely an externalization of the body in a technology of writing, but part of Los’s <hi rend="i">labor</hi>, an act of intellectual warfare as much as an act of mechanical reproduction. “The connection of the press with Los and his labor suggests instead a reinvestment of creative consciousness in the modes of production of meaning: the printing press is as much an extension of his body as his anvil and furnaces are” (142). Unfortunately, writing as political <hi rend="i">struggle</hi> is often missing from Pierce’s account, but there are flashes within this chapter that suggest just how important the battle for Milton’s inheritance was within an emerging literary public sphere that sought to confine this dangerous precursor within clearly defined “classical” boundaries.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">The Wond’rous Art</hi> concludes by returning to a detail from <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> where a devil dictates to scribes, part of what Pierce calls “the Infernal Scriptorium.” The devil dictating as part of this scriptorium, engaged in argument, is intrinsically dialogic rather than monologic and is invoked as an example of Barthes’s scriptor. Pierce’s comment that he wishes to emphasize this social aspect of writing so as not to detach a theory of writing from historical and social concerns “as some strands of American deconstruction have appeared to do” (156), is, unfortunately, too little too late. Nonetheless, his attempt to recuperate a theory of Blake’s writing from mechanical repetition is a worthy one, and while I find <hi rend="i">The Wond’rous Art</hi> a little too implicated in precisely those ahistorical traits that have dogged certain “strands of American deconstruction,” it illuminates some of the minute particulars of Blake’s writing.</p>

          <p>Blake has for some time ceased to be the “solitary visionary” with no “definite contacts with Hindus texts” depicted in Raymond Schwab’s <hi rend="i">Le Renaissance oriental</hi> (1950, English trans. 1984).<ref target="n11" type="note">1</ref> Thanks now to David Weir, the source texts and also those who possibly mediated Hindu myths to Blake have been further identified. More importantly, <hi rend="i">Brahma in the West</hi> puts Blake’s references to Hinduism, long since brought to our attention through the scholarly intuition of S. Foster Damon, Northrop Frye, and Kathleen Raine, into their contemporary discourses (45ff). Weir’s book is a fresh attempt at interpreting the dynamic of Blake’s Zoa and Emanation constellations. <note id="n11">1.

          <p>While delineating the scholarly ambitions and different agendas of those who wrote on Hinduism in the late eighteenth century, Weir argues that Blake was not only highly sensitive but also very receptive to the political implications of the Oriental Renaissance. <hi rend="i">Brahma in the West</hi> is essentially an attempt to historicize Blake’s engagement with the knowledge of Hinduism potentially available to him at the time. Although the links between Blake and some of the protagonists of the Oriental Renaissance are tentative, information about India was easy to come by. While Blake refers to Charles Wilkins as late as 1809, Weir documents that the <hi rend="i">Analytical Review</hi> discussed the translation of Hindu myths as early as 1790 (91). He stresses further that the comparative studies of Eastern religion “found a ready audience among members of London’s dissenting community” (87). Casting Blake as a fervent reader of the radical press and firmly establishing him within the radical and dissenting circle of Joseph Johnson, Weir points out that Blake’s perception of Hinduism was biased towards radicalism from the very beginning. It was through Johnson’s <hi rend="i">Analytical Review</hi> that Blake was encouraged to equate political content with mythological form. This approach makes Weir a stimulating read.</p>
          <p>In Britain, Indian politics were perceived as part of the expansion of the Empire. With the India Act of 1784—an attempt to assume responsibility and regulate the administration of India and its inhabitants—the Pitt government made clear its intention to curb the economic power of the East India Company. Though in <hi rend="i">Brahma in the West</hi> we learn little about global war, British imperialism, colonial rule, or even the role of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Weir’s discussion of the complex and complicated situation of Indian politics and the British constructs of the Orient is often broad and general, and his referencing of Blake’s potentially India-inspired metaphors is meticulous. When it comes to Blake’s poem “The Tyger,” Weir takes an imaginative leap to India: encouraged by the power vacuum left by the French Revolution, the Muslim leader Tipu Sultan—self-declared “Citizen Tipu”—began to attack the British. Even though he was overwhelmed by General Munro in

1792, a different kind of defeat was noted by the British public when it became known that the general’s son had been killed by an Indian tiger-in the same year. Weir’s neat conclusion is that “The Tyger” was not only written in response to young Munro’s death, but that its tiger was also partly Indian (20).</p>
          <p>Within Britain the arguments about empire and revolution centered around Edmund Burke, who condemned the French Revolution and criticized the former Governor General of Bengal, Warren Hastings (1732-1818). Whereas Burke’s polemic campaign against Hastings resulted in a conservative policy success, the English Jacobins began to see both the Governor General and India as victims of the Pitt government (25). The possible connection between Blake and Hastings is Charles Wilkins’s 1785 translation of the <hi rend="i">Bhagavad Gita.</hi> Hastings not only supported this translation, but also wrote its preface and claimed that Hindu faith was a variation on Christian doctrine. Weir writes: “there are parts of Hastings’s account of the <hi rend="i">Gita</hi> that relate in general terms to theological elements in Blake’s evolving mythology”(94).</p>
          <p>By the late eighteenth century works on Hinduism, written by the linguist and first president of the Asiatic Society of Bengal Sir William Jones (1746-94), were widely available. According to Weir, Jones’s “On the Gods of Greece, Italy, and India,” reviewed by Henry Fuseli for the <hi rend="i">Analytical Review</hi> in 1790, may in particular have encouraged Blake to insist on the antiquity of the Eastern faith when challenging the authority of the Western church in his <hi rend="i">Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> (often dated 1790-93). Indeed, most of the mythographic studies of the 1790s were either published by Johnson or reviewed and discussed in the <hi rend="i">Analytical Review</hi> (46). The arguments of these works—often inherently theological and sometimes anti-French—are often closely intertwined, which leads Weir to conclude that Blake was attracted to India via Jones and his followers rather than through Joseph Bryant’s <hi rend="i">A New System, or, An Analysis of Ancient Mythology</hi> (1774-76)—an edition for which Blake had made engravings during his apprenticeship to James Basire. Kathleen Raine in <hi rend="i">Blake and Tradition</hi> (1969) concedes that Blake may have been familiar with Jones and Wilkins, and

then emphasizes what she had identified as the “link between Blake’s philosophical studies of Berkeley and the mythology of the veiled goddess.”<ref target="n12" type="note">2</ref><note id="n12">2. Kathleen Raine, <hi rend="i">Blake and Tradition</hi>, 2 vols. (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1969) II: 177.</note></p>
          <p>Weir analyzes “the Mundane Egg” and the “Veil of Vala” in relation to Thomas Maurice’s <hi rend="i">The History of Hindustan</hi> (1796-98) and William Jones’s “A Hymn to Narayena” (1785). Blake’s use of the spider in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> is referenced to Joseph Priestley’s <hi rend="i">A Comparison of the Institutions of Moses with Those of the Hindoos and other Ancient Nations</hi> (1799), and the attack on priestcraft is glossed with William Julius Mickle’s “Enquiry into the Religious Tenets and Philosophy of the Brahmins” (1798). Weir also identifies key visual quotations in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and traces them back to Edward Moor’s <hi rend="i">The Hindu Pantheon</hi> (1810), pointing out that Moor’s engraver, Moses Haughton, lived with Fuseli (75).</p>
          <p>It is interesting to see how Weir positions himself with respect to the research undertaken into Blake’s theology—beginning with J. G. Davies’s <hi rend="i">The Theology of William Blake</hi> (1948), extensively revised by Jon Mee and E. P. Thompson in the early 1990s, and more recently amended in an attempt to identify Blake’s theology with a specific religious alignment of 1790’s dissent. Weir makes references to E. P. Thompson’s discussion of Muggletonianism and A. D. Nuttall’s of Gnosticism, but seems strangely unaware of Keri Davies’s work, which gives compelling evidence that Thompson was wrong in linking Blake to the Muggletonians.<ref target="n13" type="note">3</ref> Indeed, how can Weir assume that Thompson as a Marxist historian would discuss religion on its own terms? Ideally, Weir ought to have drawn on a wider range of authorities on eighteenth-century dissent and antinomianism before plunging himself—and trying to pull his readers after him—into a deep discussion of Blake’s theology. One example of Weir’s rushed shortcuts is his suggestion that the Behmenists constitute a sect (127). <note id="n13">3. Keri Davies, “William Blake’s Mother: A New Identification,” <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> 33.2 (fall 1999): 36-50.</note></p>
          <p>Weir’s neoplatonist argument is important. He essentially reintroduces Blake as a neoplatonist while presenting him as a combination of radial writer and mystic poet. Blake’s link to neoplatonism in the wake of its “revival” (104) is usually based on his acquaintance with the Plato translator Thomas Taylor. In <hi rend="i">Witness against the Beast</hi> (1993), E. P Thompson argued that this connection was not very helpful. Interestingly, while Thompson in his revision of G. M. Harper’s <hi rend="i">The Neoplatonism of William Blake</hi> (1961) tries to separate interpretation from biographical fact, Weir seems to be doing the reverse. He argues that next to the antinomian under-current with which Hindu myths were offered to their late eighteenth-century audience, there also existed a tendency to make Hinduism neoplatonist: “the antinomian points of Wilkin’s <hi rend="i">Gita</hi> have a kind of theological complement in William Jones’s Neoplatonic explanations of the Hindu system” (104). The link to Blake is obviously the <hi rend="i">Analytical Review</hi>, which disseminated the combination of antinomian mythography with neoplatonist belief made explicit in Jones’s “On the Gods of Greece, Italy and India.” Weir stresses that neoplatonism was an integral part of dissenting theology. Consequently, Blake “set antinomianism and Neoplatonism in a reciprocal theological relationship and made them reinforce one another” (105). Neoplatonism in Blake has most notably been discussed by both Kathleen Raine and E. P. Thompson. While Raine insisted on Blake’s gradual and selective absorption of hermetic thought, Thompson rejected this stance to differentiate between an early exposure to radical-dissenting interpretations of the Bible—in particular, those proposed by Behmenists and Philadelphians—and a later, mature engagement with the sources themselves. In the end it is not entirely clear how Weir resolves the contradictions between Raine and Thompson. Regrettable also is that Weir does not acknowledge the pioneering work of Piloo Nanavutty. She identified a number of available publications on India as well as of Indian texts and started looking for traces of Hindu thought in Blake long before Raine.<ref target="n14" type="note">4</ref><note id="n14">4. Piloo Nanavutty, “William Blake and the Hindu Creation Myths,” <hi rend="i">The Divine Vision: Studies in the Poetry and Art of William Blake</hi>, ed. Vivian de Sola Pinto (London: Victor Gollancz P, 1957) 163-82.</note></p>
          <p>In relation to the scholarly interest taken in Blake’s theology and politics in the 1790s, this study of Blake not only revises—or rather reopens—the discussion on Blake’s awareness of Eastern religion, but also argues convincingly for Blake’s participation in the Oriental Renaissance. <hi rend="i">Brahma in the West</hi> fits in well with the recent developments in Blake studies. It highlights the possible interpenetration of Blake’s creative mythography and the late eighteenth-century Westernized version of Hinduism and thus gives a highly useful description of the interaction between religion, society and cultural change.</p>
