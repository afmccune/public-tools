        <p>G. E. Bentley, Jr.’s most recent Blake publications are <hi rend="i">The Stranger from Paradise</hi>: A Biography of William Blake (2001, 2003) and <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, second edition (2004). As of press time, he is scampering after Drs. Schuchard and Davies on the trail of Blake’s mother as a Moravian.</p>
        <p>Keri Davies is secretary of the Blake Society. He is currently research fellow on the Arts and Humanities Research Boardfunded project at The Nottingham Trent University, “East Midlands Moravian Belief Communities with Special Reference to William Blake.”</p>
        <p>Andrew Lincoln teaches in the School of English and Drama, Queen Mary, University of London, U.K. He is interested in Blake’s debt to the Enlightenment.</p>
        <p>Marsha Keith Schuchard, an independent scholar, received her Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin. Her research focuses on the influence of Sabbatian Kabbalism, Illuminist Freemasonry, and Swedenborgianism on eighteenth-century authors and artists. She recently published <hi rend="i">Restoring the Temple of Vision: Cabalistic Freemasonry and Stuart Culture</hi> (Leiden: Brill Academic, 2002), and is presently completing <hi rend="i">Why Mrs. Blake Cried: William Blake and the Sexual Basis of Spiritual Vision</hi> (London: Random House, forthcoming).</p>

                  <ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref>
                  <note id="n1">1. There is nothing in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (1977) and <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> (1995) corresponding to Division II: Blake’s Circle.</note>
                </title>
              </head>
              <p>Division II is organized by individual (say, William Hayley or John Flaxman), with works by and about Blake’s friends and patrons, living individuals with whom he had significant direct and demonstrable contact. It includes Thomas Butts and his family, Robert Hartley Cromek, George Cumberland, John Flaxman and his family, Henry Fuseli, Thomas and William Hayley, John Linnell and his family, Samuel Palmer, James Parker, George Richmond, Henry Crabb Robinson, Thomas Stothard, John Varley, and Thomas Griffiths Wainewright. It does <hi rend="i">not</hi> include important contemporaries with whom Blake’s contact was negligible or non-existent, such as John Constable and William Wordsworth and Edmund Burke. Such major figures are dealt with more comprehensively elsewhere, and the light they throw upon Blake is very dim.</p>
              <p>Reviews, listed here under the book reviewed, are only for works which are substantially about Blake, not for those with only, say, a chapter on Blake. The authors of the reviews may be recovered from the index.</p>
              <p>I take <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (1977) and <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> (1995), faute de mieux, to be the standard bibliographical books on Blake<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> and have noted significant differences from them. <note id="n2">2. Except for the states of the plates for Blake’s commercial book engravings, where the standard authority is Robert N. Essick, <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations</hi> (1991).</note></p>
              <p>I have made no systematic attempt to record manuscripts and typescripts, audio books and magazines, broadcasts on radio or television, calendars, CD-ROMs, chinaware,<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> comic books, computer printouts, exhibitions without catalogues, festivals and lecture series, furniture with inscriptions, lipstick,<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> microforms, music, pillows, poems, postage stamps, posters, published scores, recorded readings and singings, rubber stamps, T-shirts, tattoos, video recordings, or e-mail related to Blake. <note id="n3">3. E.g., the decorated ceramic bowl by Bernard Leach with verses from Blake round the rim (reproduced in the Kyoto Blake exhibition catalogue [2003] fig. 14).</note><note id="n4">4. See Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2002,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 36.4 (spring 2003): 129.</note></p>
              <p>The status of electronic “publications” becomes increasingly vexing. Some such works seem to be merely electronic versions of physically stable works, and some suggest no more knowledge than how to operate a computer, such as reviews invited for the listings of the book sale firm of Amazon.com, which are divided into those by (1) the author, (2) the publisher, and (3) other, perhaps disinterested, remarkers. In my experience, they rarely provide more than fool’s gold. For instance, on 3 March 2004 “Bentley, <hi rend="i">Stranger from Paradise</hi>” (without quotation marks in the search) had 772 Google entries, which included catalogues (e.g., Tuscaloosa Public Library), academic course prospectuses, curricula vitae, Town &amp; Country Toy Dog Club of Greater Andover, Karaoke WOW!, and endless offers for sale, while “<hi rend="i">Stranger from Paradise</hi>” had 2920 entries. I have not searched for electronic publications, and I report here only those I have happened upon which appear to bear some authority.<ref target="n5" type="note">5</ref><note id="n5">5. See for instance entries for 2002 Northwestern exhibition (review); Bentley, <hi rend="i">Stranger from Paradise</hi> (review); Butlin; Connolly; Essick and Viscomi; Friedlander; Goldberg; Howie; Kraemer; Lussier; Prickett; Rix.</note></p>

              <p>Blake studies are alive and well in 2003. This checklist records 50 books, 205 essays, and 47 reviews, and certainly there are some which have been overlooked, particularly reviews. The books include 17 editions of Blake’s writings and art, 8 exhibition catalogues of 1919, 2001, 2002, and 2003, and 5 dissertations, from Florida, Hungary, Iowa, Southampton, and Texas.</p>
              <p>The works recorded here come from around the world, not only from English-speaking countries such as Australia, Britain, Canada, India, and the United States, but from xenophonic countries as well. There are works in Chinese (15), French (3), German (2), Hebrew (4), Hungarian (2), Italian (3), Japanese (34), Korean (4), Russian (1), and Spanish (8). The works in Hungarian are supplemented by an English essay in a Hungarian journal and a book in English which was a Hungarian doctoral dissertation, and there are English essays in journals in Japan and Taiwan (6).</p>
              <p>The most striking innovation here is in the number of works about Blake from Taiwan. When my wife and I went to Taiwan in 1970<ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref> to work in the National Library for a week, we found, as I recall, no Chinese work by or about Blake, though my wife, playing hooky, found one work by my mother and several by my father—more, to her disrespectful delight, than by me. Consequently we spent a wonderful week at the National Palace Museum. <note id="n6">6. Because of Senator McCarthy and his ilk, it was not convenient to go to China in 1970.</note></p>
              <p>Thirty-four years later, Professor Ching-erh Chang of the National Taiwan University compiled “William Blake in Taiwan: A Bibliography,” of which he very generously sent me a copy. This includes a poem by Blake translated in 1960 (omitted below), a translation of Blake in 1966, and 20 publications about Blake in Taiwan—plus 6 M.A. theses dealing with Blake.<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref><note id="n7">7.

              <p>A problem arises with the transliterations of works from Taiwan. Recently the Pinyin system of transliteration, adopted in China in 1949, was introduced in Taiwan. However, it is still customary to give proper names of Taiwanese authors in the older Wade-Giles system. The same Chinese character for a proper name may therefore be transliterated differently in Taiwan, in China, and in Japan. This is particularly trying with family names, which may appear in different places in an alphabetical list according to the system of transliteration used.</p>
              <p>Other evidence of Blake’s international and polyglottal appeal is the record of Mr. Taro Nagasaki’s Blake collection, now partly in Kyoto City University of Arts. The collection, formed early in the twentieth century, consists of 52 books, including a number with Blake’s commercial book illustrations. At the time it was formed, it was probably the largest collection of Blake’s commercial book illustrations in Japan—and perhaps it remains so today.</p>

                <p>A couple of well-known works have changed hands.

                <p>The new editions of Blake’s selected works offer little in the way of solid new knowledge to Blake students. A few are doubtless useful as introductions to Blake in areas where English is not the first language, such as <hi rend="i">Blake no kotoba</hi> [<hi rend="i">Aphoristic Words from Blake</hi>], ed. Soetsu Yanagi (1921) in Japan, a new edition of <hi rend="i">Ol mi-shire blak ve-kits</hi> [<hi rend="i">More from the Poetry of Blake and Keats</hi>], tr.

Samuel Friedman (1986) in Israel, <hi rend="i">William Blake: Versek és Próféciák</hi> [<hi rend="i">Poems and Prophecies</hi>], ed. Miklós Szenczi (1959) in Hungary, and <hi rend="i">Poesía completa:</hi> Versión, prólogo y presentación Francesc LL. Cardona (1999) in Spain. And it is perhaps worth drawing attention to a work in Catalan which is excluded from the list below because it is a multi-author anthology: <hi rend="i">William Blake, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats: Poesia, veritat i vida</hi>, Presentació i traducció de Joan Solé (Barcelona: Columna Edicions, Dec. 2001) Clàssics i Moderns Columna, 8°, 248 pp.; ISBN: 8466401873; its “Notas biogràfiques” includes “William Blake (1757-1827)” (19-28); the Blake texts from Ostriker consist of <hi rend="i">All Religions are One, There is No Natural Religion</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> (61-88), all of course in prose.</p>

              <p>A textless and one might almost say pointless new edition of the engravings for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> (1808) appeared.</p>
              <p>Trifling Blake sketches for Darwin’s <hi rend="i">Botanic Garden</hi> (1791) and Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads</hi> (1802) have been newly uncovered.</p>
              <p>A new copy of Blake’s elusive print for <hi rend="i">The Ladies New and Polite Pocket Memorandum-Book</hi> (1782) was discovered by David Bindman in an album of fashion plates and has now
<pb id="p38-7" n="7"/>
passed, like so many other fascinating Blake <hi rend="i">disjecta membra</hi>, into the collection of Robert N. Essick at the Bibliotheca La Solana. No copy of the book itself has yet been discovered.</p>
              <p>The history of Blake’s nineteen watercolors (1805) for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> (1808) rediscovered in 2001 becomes yet more bizarre. From about 1836 to 2001 they were in the collection of the Stannard family, whose latest heirs in Glasgow lost sight of their significance. They went for a risible sum as part of a small family library to a Glasgow general second-hand bookstore called Caledonia Books, where they were apparently taken to be colored engravings—though no engraving for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> colored by Blake is known.<ref target="n9" type="note">9</ref> From Caledonia Books they were acquired, perhaps on approval, for £1,000 by a Yorkshire bookseller named Paul Williams. All this was discovered by a brilliant journalist named Martin Bailey who succeeded where all the warranted Blake scholars who had seen the watercolors<ref target="n10" type="note">10</ref> and tried to trace their history had failed. <note id="n9">9. A copy of the quarto Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> (1808) in the Huntington is skillfully hand colored, but not by Blake.</note><note id="n10">10. Dr. E. B. Bentley, G. E. Bentley, Jr., Professor David Bindman, Mr. Martin Butlin, Professor Robert N. Essick, Dr. Robin Hamlyn, Dr. Rosamund Paice, Professor Morton D. Paley.</note></p>
              <p>But the drama does not end there. The Tate, doubtless the most appropriate home for the Blair watercolors, was given an option to buy the drawings at £2,000,000 (or about £100,000 each), later raised to £4,200,000 plus £700,000 tax, and started scampering about to raise such a huge sum. At this point, the sale hung fire while a legal sideshow determined who really owned the designs and on what terms they had or should have changed hands. When this issue was resolved, the Tate heaved an institutional sigh of relief and doubtless prepared publicity about acquiring the most sensational Blake find for a century—when they discovered that the Blair watercolors had been abruptly acquired at a yet larger price by the London dealer Libby Howie, ostensibly for an unnamed American collector. The latest information is that they are languishing in a London bank vault, perhaps waiting for a better offer or for permission to export them, a permission which is unlikely to be granted them without a struggle. In sum, the Blair watercolors have returned almost to the status quo ante; the existence of the drawings is known, their authenticity (unlike their price) is unquestioned, and a few have been reproduced, but they are as inaccessible as ever. At least one Blake scholar’s request to see them has been politely put off sine die.</p>
              <p>It seems that the more expensive Blake’s works become, the less visible they are likely to be to serious Blake scholars. Fortunately there are many exceptions to this gloomy rule. Long life to the generous!</p>

              <p>The Huntington held an exhibition of its Blake holdings, with some of its gaps filled in from the extraordinary collection of Robert N. Essick, who also prepared the exhibition, though—alas!—there was no catalogue worthy of the institution or the curator.</p>
              <p>The exhibition in Kyoto was short on original works by William Blake, even books with his commercial engravings, but the catalogue and exhibition were very rich in the history of Blake enthusiasm in Japan. In this area the catalogue is a major contribution to scholarship, going far beyond <hi rend="i">Blake Studies in Japan</hi> (1995) and all other works on the subject known to me.</p>
              <p>John Windle produced a catalogue of Blakes with something for every taste and pocketbook, from obscure reprints to the finest tempera still in private hands, from $3.95 to a price so high it would be embarrassing to print it (“Price on Request”).</p>
              <p>In 2002 Northwestern University Library held a modest exhibition of books with Blake’s commercial engravings.</p>
              <p>The Albright-Knox Gallery in Buffalo held a little exhibition of Blake, chiefly <hi rend="i">Job</hi> and Dante prints, but there was no catalogue.</p>

              <p>The name of William Blake Esq. appears as a subscriber not only in Joseph Thomas’s <hi rend="i">Religious Emblems</hi> (1809), but also in a newly discovered prospectus for the work, indicating that William Blake Esq. had been among the first to subscribe to the book, probably as a result of a private solicitation among the author’s friends—the poet was certainly a protégé of Joseph Thomas. And the fact that Thomas’s designer J. Thurston is also dignified by the otherwise unwarranted “Esq.” suggests that it is the poet-artist William Blake who subscribed to Thomas’s book and not one of the legions of other William Blakes who lived in London at the time.<ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref><note id="n11">11.

                <p>Of several of the books here I can give no opinion because I have not seen them. Joyce Townsend, ed., <hi rend="i">William Blake: The Painter at Work</hi> (2003) promises well, for her previous highly technical work on Blake’s paint media is wonderfully accomplished and original. Shoichi Matsushima, <hi rend="i">Blake no Shiso to Kindai Nihon: Blake wo Yomu</hi> [<hi rend="i">The Idea of Blake and Modern Japan: A Reading of Blake</hi>] (2003) and Fumi Nakayama, <hi rend="i">William Blake: 200 Nen go no Seikimatsu</hi> [<hi rend="i">William Blake: Blake in 2000</hi>] (2001) are inaccessible to me because of my scandalous ignorance of Japanese.</p>

                <p>Derek Pearsall, <hi rend="i">William Langland, William Blake, and the Poetry of Hope</hi> (2003), though separately published, is merely the text of a lecture, perhaps chiefly valuable to students of the Poetry of Hope.</p>
                <p>Dóra Janzer Csikós, <hi rend="i">"Four Mighty Ones Are in Every Man": The Development of the Fourfold in Blake</hi> (2003) is a Hungarian doctoral dissertation concerned with “personality typology” based on physiognomy in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> which may seem exotic to those unfamiliar with the Szondi test or “system of drives.”</p>
                <p>Saree Makdisi, <hi rend="i">William Blake and the Impossible History of the 1790s</hi> (2003) carefully uses the “varieties of radical ideology” among Blake’s contemporaries (26) to illuminate with admirable sensitivity Blake’s works of the 1790s, especially <hi rend="i">America.</hi></p>
                <p>John Pierce, <hi rend="i">The Wond’rous Art: William Blake and Writing</hi> (2003) is concerned with “the way in which the graphic and the oral are used as conceptual fields in Blake’s works” (27). It is not significantly related to calligraphy or handwriting.</p>
                <p>Nick Rawlinson, <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Comic Vision</hi> (2003) makes a surprisingly strong case that “Blake was a subtle, profound and skilled comic writer” whose “work seems to pulse with comic energy.” His definition of “comic” focuses upon joy, which gives him surprisingly wide scope.</p>
                <p>Cristóbal Serra, <hi rend="i">Pequeño diccionario de William Blake</hi> (Caracteres simbólicos) (§1992), [Second Edition] (2000), is an alphabetical account of hard names in Blake, in Spanish.</p>
                <p>Frederick Sontag, <hi rend="i">Truth and Imagination: The Universes Within</hi> (1998) is a “quest for the new vision in which Blake specializes,” especially in Chapter 1, “Exploring the Worlds within the Mind.”</p>
                <p>Janet Warner, <hi rend="i">Other Sorrows, Other Joys: The Marriage of Catherine Sophia Boucher and William Blake</hi> (2003) is a cheerful “tapestry of fact and fiction” in which the facts are carefully reported from the poet’s life and writings and the fiction imports graphic sex, genteel or at least artistic crime, secret societies, and drugs, with a plausible stress upon banality in Catherine. An example (264-65) derives from Blake’s letter to Thomas Butts of 2 October 1800:
<q>
William was sitting on the Sea Shore yesterday and had a wonderful Vision. He said that the Light was reflecting off the Sands, and each particle of light was a Man, and every stone and herb and tree that he saw was in Human Form, and that finally all Human Forms became One, and he was part of it, and so was I and [his sister] Cathy, and Mr. Hayley, and Mr. and Mrs. Butts also.<lb/>

The most sensational event in London then was the long drawn-out trial of Warren Hastings for, among other things, abuse of his power while Governor General of India, and Weir points out that the trial was, and was widely seen to be, a political issue including attacks on or defense of colonialism. Some readers of the book may wonder at his confidence or his evidence “that Blake read [Volney’s] <hi rend="i">The Ruins</hi>” (51) or “that he would have read” “the Gita” (99), but the political and theological context of Hinduism in the 1790s in London is usefully established.</p>
                <p>There are also new editions (not just reprints) of Ackroyd’s <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> (1995) in Japanese (2002), of Altizer’s <hi rend="i">New Apocalypse</hi> (1967) with a new appendix on what he’d do differently this time (2000), and of Muggeridge’s <hi rend="i">Third Testament</hi> (1976) in 2002.</p>

                <p>There are in this checklist many reprints in Bloom’s anthology of fragments of Blake criticism (2003—40 excerpts) and detailed proposals for lectures at the Kyoto Blake Conference (2003—37)—though the full essays were (or doubtless will be) meritorious. There are collections of essays in <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi>, ed. Morris Eaves and M. D. Paley (2003—19), <hi rend="i">The Cambridge Companion to William Blake</hi>, ed. Morris Eaves (2003—16), and <hi rend="i">Taiyoka</hi> (1927—11), plus contemporary directories referring to Blake (43) and records of his father and brother voting (6) which, oddly, have never appeared in a Blake bibliography before.</p>
                <p>Significant but—alas!—unseen essays on Blake include John Beer, <hi rend="i">Romantic Consciousness: Blake to Mary Shelley</hi> (2003), which has a section on Blake. And Shoichi Matsushima, Hisao Ishizuka, Masashi Suzuki, Yoko Ima-Izumi, and Yuko Takahashi, <hi rend="i">Ekkyo suru Geijutsuka—Ima Blake wo Yomu: William Blake: A Border-Crossing Artist—Reading his Works Now</hi> (2002) seems to be a collection of Japanese essays on reading Blake.</p>

                <p>Among the most obvious tools of scholarship is finding lists of what is known about the subject. These include G. E. Bentley, Jr., with the assistance of Dr. Hikari Sato for Japanese publications, “William Blake and His Circle: A Checklist of Publications and Discoveries in 2002,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 37.1 (summer 2003): 4-31, which covers all newly discovered publications with Blake in the title or works about him of more than five consecutive pages, together with all briefer references to Blake published before 1863, especially those before 1831. These lists are extensive but hardly comprehensive; for instance, in the present one for 2003, there are works published in 2002 (29), in 1863-2001 (101), in 1831-63 (2), and even the most heavily mined field before 1831 (30), indicating embarrassingly how much had previously been overlooked.</p>
                <p>A similar but much more comprehensive undertaking is in Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2002,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 36.4 (spring 2003): 116-37. His essay records in wonderful detail not only original works by Blake and his close friends such as George Cumberland and John Linnell, with mini-essays in the captions of works reproduced, but also curiosities and rumors of troop movements on the borders of buying and selling. He seems to know everyone worth knowing in the worlds of Blake and book-, print-, and picture-selling and to persuade them to give up their dearest secrets. And when his
<pb id="p38-9" n="9"/>
report does not identify a shy vendor or buyer, he probably knows who it is but is too discreet to tell us.</p>
                <p>Francisco Gimeno Suances, “Notas sobre la difusión, influencia y recepción crítica de la obra de William Blake en España durante las décadas de 1920 y 1930,” <hi rend="i">Los Papeles Mojados de río seco</hi> Año 5, no. 6 (2003): 38-45, considerably expands our information about works concerning Blake in Spain as long ago as the 1920s. The number of Spanish works previously unknown to Blake bibliographers indicates how difficult it is for the virtual monoglots among us such as myself to read everything in their field about Blake; even impressively multilingual bibliographers such as D. W. Dörrbecker seem to have overlooked some of these Spanish publications.</p>
                <p>There are also recorded here surprisingly extensive lists of directories and elections in which are given the addresses and votes of Blake’s father and brothers, though he himself rarely appears in the directories, and apparently he never voted, though eligible to do so.</p>
                <p>There are several essays of importance about Blake drawings. Robert N. Essick and Rosamund A. Paice, “Newly Uncovered Blake Drawings in the British Museum,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 37.3 (winter 2003-04): 84-100, report on nine previously unknown sketches by Blake on the versos of other drawings discovered when they were dismounted for photography, and Martin Bailey, “From £1,000 to £10 Million in Two Years for Newly Discovered Blake watercolours,” <hi rend="i">Art Newspaper</hi> online, finds crucial details of the history of Blake’s nineteen watercolors for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> which had eluded all the Blake scholars panting hard on the trail. Troy Patenaude, “‘The glory of a Nation’: Recovering William Blake’s 1809 Exhibition,” <hi rend="i">British Art Journal</hi> 4.1 (2003): 52-63, discovers crucial details of the arrangement and dimensions of the rooms of Blake’s family home at 28 Broad Street and from them deduces plausibly the hanging sequence of the pictures exhibited there in Blake’s private exhibition of 1809-10 and the dimensions of Blake’s long-lost and huge “Ancient Britons.”</p>
                <p>Joseph Viscomi provides a masterful, brief account of Blake’s “Illuminated Printing” in <hi rend="i">The Cambridge Companion to William Blake</hi>, ed. Morris Eaves (2003), 37-62. And G. E. Bentley, Jr., “Blake and God in the Garden: The Life of a Myth,” <hi rend="i">Descant</hi> 34.4 (winter 2003): 112-23, musters detailed evidence once again to persuade the credulous of the mythical (i.e., untrue) character of the story of Blake and Catherine naked in their garden reading <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>—or climbing trees or dancing.</p>

                <p>The connection between Blake and Hebrew is surprisingly extensive. Not only are there newly recorded editions of Blake in Hebrew (1968, 1986, 1997), but there is a new doctoral dissertation on the subject.<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> More accessibly, Sheila A. Spector, “Blake’s Graphic Use of Hebrew,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 37.2 (fall 2003): 63-79, discusses how Blake used the forms of the Hebrew alphabet, particularly aleph. And Ted Holt, “Blake’s ‘Elohim’ and the Hutchinsonian Fire: Anti-Utopianism and Christian Hebraism in the Work of William Blake,” <hi rend="i">Romanticism</hi> 9 (2003): 20-36, provides fascinating evidence that “Blake’s reading of the Pentateuch was undoubtedly coloured by Hutchinsonian interpretations of it.” Investigation of the distant but tantalizing connection between Hutchinsonians, Thomas Butts, and Epsom might lead the investigation yet closer to Blake. <note id="n12">12. Rachel Leah Wagner, “‘Words of eternity in human forms’: William Blake’s Transformation of Styles, Forms, and Genres of the Hebrew Bible in ‘Jerusalem,’” <hi rend="i">DAI</hi> 64 (2003): 1294-95A.</note></p>
                <p>Similarly, Ian Balfour, “The Mediated Vision: Blake, <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, and the Lines of Prophetic Tradition,” Chapter 6 of his <hi rend="i">The Rhetoric of Romantic Prophecy</hi> (2002), argues learnedly and persuasively that “Blake engages the Hebraic, Christian, and English prophetic traditions in a spectacular and highly self-conscious way.” And Robert Ryan, “Blake and Religion,” <hi rend="i">The Cambridge Companion to William Blake</hi>, ed. Morris Eaves (2003), 150-68, provides a useful account of what we know of Blake’s religion based on the distressingly meager evidence.</p>
                <p>In the same collection, David Bindman’s essay on “Blake as a Painter,” 85-109, provides a confident and comprehensive synopsis which is just what such a <hi rend="i">Companion</hi> calls for, and Jon Mee, “Blake’s Politics in History,” 133-49, argues once again that “Blake was always a deeply political writer.”</p>
                <p>Rosamund A. Paice, “Encyclopaedic Resistance: Blake, Rees’s <hi rend="i">Cyclopœdia</hi>, and the <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> Separate Plate,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 37.2 (fall 2003): 44-62, suggests “that the <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> plate was begun as a commercial plate,” an hypothesis with fascinating implications.</p>
                <p>In the exceedingly unlikely vehicle of an online undergraduate B.A. thesis (1973, revised 1986), Edward Robert Friedlander, M.D., “William Blake’s <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>: Meaning and Madness,” argues with distressing or at least surprising plausibility that “Blake’s poetry and paintings present classic illustrations of the schizophrenic experience. . . . We can look to the schizophrenic experience to understand Blake’s works.” Dr. Friedlander’s evidence, and his training as a student of literature and of medicine, make his conclusion worth consideration.</p>
                <p>Blake in the service of somewhat rabid anti-capitalism has been found by Ron Heisler<ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref> from the <hi rend="i">Christian Socialist</hi> of 1884-85. These consist of: quotation from “Auguries of Innocence” ll. 75-76, 51-52, 81-84, 79-80, 113-18 following but not visibly attached to E. L. Garbett, “Interest” (an attack on it), <hi rend="i">Christian Socialist</hi> (March 1884): 157; “Holy Thursday” from <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> following but not visibly attached to an excerpt from <hi rend="i">Darkness and Dawn</hi> in <hi rend="i">Christian Socialist</hi> (July 1884): 27; “Mammon” (i.e., “I rose up at the dawn of day” [Notebook, p. 89] ll. 1-12, 21-22, 13-18, 25-28), <hi rend="i">Christian Socialist</hi> (Aug. 1884): 37, which may well have been the stimulus for the skillful anonymous poem called “Oh, Mammon, Hear Us!” (March 1885: 155) parodying a popular hymn; Anon., “In Answer to a Prayer for Light,” <hi rend="i">Christian Socialist</hi> (March 1885):

                <p>A tiresomely perennial issue in Blake studies is the allegation of his Cockneyism. For instance, a recent critic writes of “the Cockney in which he [Blake] wrote and, no doubt, spoke,”<ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref> and the allegation is likely to recur. Is it relevant to the author of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience?</hi><note id="n14">14. David Punter, “Blake and Gwendolen: Territory, Periphery and the Proper Name,” in <hi rend="i">English Romanticism and the Celtic World</hi>, ed. Gerard Carruthers and Alan Rawes (2003) 68.</note></p>
                <p>The answer may depend on which of the changing meanings of “Cockney” is being used. The term has been variously applied. Over the last half-millennium or so “Cockney” has been used to mean: an egg; a mother’s darling, a milksop; a wanton townsman; a person born in London within the sound of Bow bells; a class term of vilification, as in Blackwood’s dismissal of Keats and Leigh Hunt as members of “The Cockney School of Poetry”; one who loves London inordinately;<ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref> and a Humpty Dumpty definition of what I want it to mean. <note id="n15">15. Definitions 1-5 derive from the <hi rend="i">OED</hi>; 6 is a modern usage, to be found in, for instance, Ackroyd’s <hi rend="i">Blake.</hi></note></p>
                <p>I hope we may agree that Blake is not “an egg.” Besides, “‘It’s very provoking,’ Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence, ‘to be called an egg—<hi rend="i">very</hi>!’” Blake’s contemporaries would not have called him a “milksop,” particularly those who had encountered him in anger. Nor is “a wanton townsman” more relevant. Blake was certainly not “born within the sound of Bow bells,” and indeed the place of his birth near Golden Square had not long before 1757 been an area of some fashion—aristocrats and future prime ministers had been christened as he was at St. James, Piccadilly. Blake is no more a member of the Cockney School of Leigh Hunt and John Keats than he is of the Lake School of Wordsworth and Coleridge. In a more common pejorative context, he does not share the “Cockney” characteristics of gross ignorance of high-culture sophistication, he is not aspirately-challenged, omitting the “h” sound in “hope” and “how” and wantonly adding it as in “honor” and “hour”—and, besides, these cultural and linguistic characteristics of “Cockney” are largely anachronistic when applied to Blake, their widespread use being popularized by Dickens subsequent to Blake’s death.<ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref> Blake’s attitude toward London is devastatingly demonstrated in his “London” with its universal “marks of woe,” in “the terrible desart of London” and “the manacles of Londons dungeons dark.”<ref target="n17" type="note">17</ref> And one may speculate on the aptness of “Cockney” as applied to that great London-lover Dr. Johnson. But I am a sufficient democrat to agree with Humpty Dumpty: “‘When <hi rend="i">I</hi> use a word,’ Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less.’” “‘The question is,’ said Humpty Dumpty, ‘which is to be master—that’s all.’” <note id="n16">16.

                  <p>“There can be no doubt at all, I think, that what most appealed to Blake in Swedenborg’s doctrines was the notion of a new era? and [sic] that he valued it not because it was a startlingly original teaching but precisely because it was in keeping with a much older tradition of mystical prophecy.”</p>

                  <p>It is “a tapestry of fact and fiction” in which the carefully reported facts come from the poet’s life and writings and the fiction is Kate’s notebook, poems (some of the lines in <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> are hers), visions, her forgeries of Flaxman and Fuseli, her French lover Paul-Marc Philipon (369, 370), Blake’s affair with the actress and singer Elizabeth Billington, his indulgence in opium and other drugs, and a good deal of sexual detail. There are “Biographical Notes” on real people (365-68) and “Author’s Note” (369-71). The fiction is often persuasive: “There are no Evil Spirits, Kate. There are only Human Spirits” (8).</p>

                <p>Thomas Stothard (1755-1834)</p>
                <p>Artist and friend of Blake</p>
                <p>Read, Dennis M. “Thomas Stothard’s <hi rend="i">The Pilgrimage to Canterbury</hi> (1806): A Study in Promotion and Popular Taste.” Chapter 6 (211-31) of <hi rend="i">Chaucer Illustrated: Five Hundred Years of The Canterbury Tales in Pictures.</hi> Ed. William K. Finley and Joseph Rosenblum. (New Castle [Delaware]: Oak Knoll Press, and London: British Library, 2003).</p>
                <p>The contemporary popularity of the picture is probably due chiefly to “the orchestrations of publicity, endorsements, and huckstering by its proprietor, Robert Hartley Cromek” (211).</p>
                <p>Part IV (221-23) deals somewhat summarily with Blake’s claim that Stothard stole his idea for a painting of the procession of the Canterbury Pilgrims: “There is no way to verify this claim, although Cromek certainly was capable of such theft. Cromek’s claim of the painting’s origin, as elaborated in the ‘Biographical Sketch of Robert Hartley Cromek’ in the 1813 <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> is, to say the least, fanciful,” for, among other things, it dates Cromek’s conception of “the idea of embodying the whole procession in a picture” to a time “some ten months after Cromek began exhibiting the painting in his home” (222).</p>

          <p>Abstract. This paper seeks to amend and extend Keri Davies’s essay on Blake’s mother published in <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> in 1999.<ref target="n32" type="note">1</ref> There, he established that Blake’s mother Catherine’s true maiden name was Wright, and that Thomas Armitage, her first husband, was born in Royston, Yorkshire in 1722, the son of Richard Armitage of Cudworth. Davies also produced evidence that contradicted E. P. Thompson’s Muggletonian hypothesis, and speculated upon the identity of Blake’s maternal grandparents. We now link Blake’s mother to a very different religious community, providing further evidence about her first marriage, and correcting the assumptions Davies made in identifying Blake’s grandparents. These latest discoveries about Blake’s mother disclose her place of birth (Walkeringham, Nottinghamshire), the names of her parents and siblings, and her association with the Moravian sect. Documentary and autographic records in the archive of the distinctive and exceptional eighteenth-century Moravian church, some dating from many years before the poet was born, are a vivid indicator of how much of our thinking about Blake’s life and early influences might need to be revised and rewritten in the future. <note id="n32">1.

          <p>Biographical discussion of William Blake has long been dominated by unexamined commonplaces regarding his family background, his early religious allegiance, and other aspects of his life and personality. Three persistent <hi rend="i">topoi</hi> dominate the nearly two hundred years of biographical writing about Blake. First, present even in Malkin’s <hi rend="i">A Father’s Memoirs of His Child</hi>, is the question of Blake’s sanity (what Malkin calls “the hue and cry of madness”).<ref target="n33" type="note">2</ref> Second, there is the belief that Blake had no contemporary audience, and thus we in posterity are Blake’s true disciples. And third, the most misleading, because the least examined, the insistence that he came from a radical dissenting family.<ref target="n34" type="note">3</ref><note id="n33">2. Benjamin Heath Malkin, <hi rend="i">A Father’s Memoirs of His Child</hi> (London: printed for Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, 1806) xxii. And even earlier, in 1794, Richard Twiss wrote of Blake: “I suppose the man to be mad; but he draws very well” (Letter to Francis Douce, 13 September 1794. Bodleian Library MS. Douce d.39 fol.70v). See Keri Davies, “Mrs. Bliss: A Blake Collector of 1794,” <hi rend="i">Blake in the Nineties</hi>, ed. Steve Clark and David Worrall (Basingstoke: Macmillan; New York: St. Martin’s, 1999) 212-30.</note><note id="n34">3. The assumption, on next to no evidence, that the Blake family belonged to some group that rejected Anglican teaching, isolated and exclusive, doctrinally eccentric, somewhat like the Muggletonians.</note></p>
          <p>A recent example of the madness <hi rend="i">topos</hi> appeared during the Tate Britain “William Blake” exhibition of 2000-01. Thomas Stuttaford, the <hi rend="i">Times</hi> medical correspondent, devoted his column to a diagnosis of Blake’s “schizophrenia.” Stuttaford wrote, “although he was obsessively hard-working, Blake was also fascinated by the mystical from an early age, which is another symptom displayed by those suffering from schizophreniform troubles.”<ref target="n35" type="note">4</ref> As long ago as 1925, in his short witty biography of Blake, Harold Bruce commented on the mador-not-mad <hi rend="i">topos</hi>:
<q>
To say confidently that Blake suffered from mythomania, or from automatism, or from occasional hyper-aesthesia, or from manic-depressive tendencies, or that he did not tend ‘towards a definite schizophrenia,’ is to add polysyllables rather than illumination to the discussion of his state.<ref target="n36" type="note">5</ref><note id="n35">4.

          <p>The second <hi rend="i">topos</hi> is that indicated by Alexander Gilchrist in the subtitle to his biography of 1863: <hi rend="i">pictor ignotus</hi>—the unknown painter—and with it the idea that Blake had no contemporary audience. But there is plentiful evidence of that contemporary audience. In 1794, Joseph Johnson, one of the foremost progressive publishers of the decade, was displaying Blake’s books for prospective customers.<ref target="n37" type="note">6</ref> Bentley’s <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> lists sixty-one persons who bought copies of the illuminated books in Blake’s lifetime or shortly after.<ref target="n38" type="note">7</ref> Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> (1808) with Blake’s illustrations had no fewer than 578 subscribers. <note id="n37">6.

          <p>The third assumption, the dissenting <hi rend="i">topos</hi>, first appears in Crabb Robinson’s essay “William Blake, Künstler, Dichter und religiöser Schwärmer” of 1811.<ref target="n39" type="note">8</ref> There Robinson notes that Blake belonged “von Geburt zu einer dissentirenden Gemeinde”—from birth to a dissenting sect. But this was written before Crabb Robinson ever met Blake. In the later account of Blake in Robinson’s diary, there is no further indication that he belonged “zu einer dissentirenden Gemeinde.” The diary account was written after Robinson had met Blake and become genuinely interested in him; Robinson records his conversations with Blake after they met in 1825 but never again does he call Blake a Dissenter.<ref target="n40" type="note">9</ref><note id="n39">8.

          <p>Alexander Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life</hi> remains our only source for much of what we know of Blake’s biography.<ref target="n41" type="note">10</ref> Gilchrist worked on his biography in the late 1850s when a number of people who knew Blake were still alive, and it is this first or second-hand information from those who knew Blake in his later years that gives Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life</hi> its continuing authority. Gilchrist makes very little use of documentary sources or public records. This means that his biography is weakest for Blake’s life before he met Palmer and Linnell, Gilchrist’s chief informants, and for any information about his family. <note id="n41">10.

          <p>It was not until 1906 that Arthur Symons consulted the parish registers of St. James’s Piccadilly, to establish the dates of birth of William’s brothers and sister.<ref target="n42" type="note">11</ref> It took until 1947 for H. M. Margoliouth to locate the marriage of James and Catherine, William’s parents (James Blake married Catherine “Harmitage” at the Mayfair Chapel, 15 October 1752).<ref target="n43" type="note">12</ref> Bentley’s <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> spreads the known information about Blake’s life over 418 pages. But the years 1757 to 1800, half of his life, occupy just the first 61 pages. Bentley adds little to Gilchrist, Symons, and Margoliouth about Blake’s childhood and parentage. <note id="n42">11.

          <p>E. P. Thompson’s acclaimed <hi rend="i">Witness against the Beast</hi> is a recent example of the persistence of unexamined and unverified ideas in Blake studies.<ref target="n44" type="note">13</ref> It became widely accepted that Thompson “offers plausible evidence to suggest that Blake’s mother may well have come from a family with Muggletonian connections.”<ref target="n45" type="note">14</ref> In reality, the Muggletonians were a small Protestant sect whose membership is largely identifiable and contains no Blake relatives. Thompson does, however, make the extraordinarily important discovery that Catherine, Blake’s mother, was married twice, first to Thomas Armitage (whom Thompson calls “Hermitage”) and then to James Blake. This, in turn, led to Keri Davies’s discovery of the date of Catherine Blake’s first marriage and her true maiden name (Wright). We can now confidently say that Catherine Wright married Thomas Armitage on 14 December 1746, was widowed in 1751, and married James Blake in October 1752. <note id="n44">13. E. P. Thompson, <hi rend="i">Witness against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law</hi> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993).</note><note id="n45">14.

          <p>Davies suggested in 1999 that Blake’s mother was the daughter of John and Elizabeth Wright of the parish of St. Martinin-the-Fields. Assuming Catherine Wright to be a Londoner seemed the simplest explanation, the one that gave the best fit with the known data. He was misled. He had unthinkingly accepted a fourth <hi rend="i">topos</hi>, one given fullest elaboration by Peter Ackroyd: that of Blake the “cockney visionary”<ref target="n46" type="note">15</ref> whom Davies assumed must have had a cockney mother. <note id="n46">15. Peter Ackroyd, “Cockney Visionaries,” <hi rend="i">The Independent</hi> 18 December 1993: 27, and in his <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> (London: Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995) passim.</note></p>
          <p>Davies concluded in 1999 by stressing how the surviving evidence not only does not support Thompson’s claims of a Muggletonian background to the Blake family, but in fact does not even support the conventional view of the Blakes as Radical Dissenters. The research reported in this present paper is the result of a suggestion made by the nineteenth-century facsimilist William Muir regarding Blake’s early religious affiliation, which we felt warranted further investigation.<ref target="n47" type="note">16</ref><note id="n47">16. On William Muir (1845-1938), see G. E. Bentley, Jr., “‘Blake . . . Had No Quaritch’: The Sale of William Muir’s Blake Facsimiles,” <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> 27.1 (summer 1993): 4-13, and Keri Davies, “William Muir and the Blake Press at Edmonton with Muir’s Letters to Kerrison Preston,” <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> 27.1 (summer 1993): 14-25.</note></p>
          <p>The nature of Blake’s religious background and development has long been insufficiently defined. In 1828 John Thomas Smith reported that William Blake had not attended “any place of Divine Worship” for the last forty years of his life.<ref target="n48" type="note">17</ref> Nancy Bogen suggests that “it seems reasonable to suppose that he was connected with a religious organization prior to that time, that is, before 1787. Indeed, Blake must have received some sort of religious training as a youth—but of what denomination remains to be seen.”<ref target="n49" type="note">18</ref><note id="n48">17.

Smith (1766-1833) had known the Blake family as a boy and had, according to his own account, been a playfellow of Blake’s younger brother, Robert.</note><note id="n49">18. Nancy Bogen, “The Problem of Blake’s Early Religion,” <hi rend="i">The Personalist</hi> vol. 49, no. 4 (autumn 1968): 509.</note></p>
          <p>The evidence of an Anglican marriage ceremony (though, without reading of banns or bishop’s license, it was technically “clandestine”), and baptism of children in the parish church, but later family burials at Bunhill Fields, suggests that the Blake family were originally Anglican, but that later on, after 28 January 1764 when the youngest child of the family (William’s sister Catherine) was baptized, they may have become members of some dissenting congregation.<ref target="n50" type="note">19</ref><note id="n50">19. Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> 7-8, has suggested adherence to a Baptist church.</note></p>
          <p>But another way of resolving this problem of Blake’s early religion is suggested by an item in his deathbed conversation. It seems that during the course of discussing his last wishes, he had expressed a preference for burial in Bunhill Fields, the Dissenters’ burial ground, and Mrs. Blake offered him a choice as to funeral arrangements; that is, “either he would have the Dissenting Minister, or the Clergyman of the Church of England, to read the service.”<ref target="n51" type="note">20</ref> It’s as though Catherine, his own wife, did not know where his preferences lay. Blake, in this account, chose the Church of England. The possibility
<pb id="p38-38" n="38"/>
then raised by Nancy Bogen is that Blake and his family were Anglicans and at same time maintained a connection with the Moravian Church.<ref target="n52" type="note">21</ref> The position of this body in England during the eighteenth century was quite unusual. While it was recognized by an Act of Parliament as an episcopal church and therefore a sister to the Church of England, its members were still required to have their places of worship licensed as Dissenting chapels. In other words, they <hi rend="i">were</hi> and then again <hi rend="i">were not</hi> Dissenters. Also, having been more intent on evangelizing than proselytizing, the Moravians encouraged those who joined their congregation not to sever their tie with whatever denomination they had been born into. The Moravians were only too pleased when they could lead their adherents back to the local parish church for the ministration of the vicar.<ref target="n53" type="note">22</ref> Accordingly, one could be an Anglican and a Moravian at the same time—and it turns out that a majority of the English brethren were and remained loyal members of the Church of England. <note id="n51">20.

          <p>This theory of Blake’s Moravian connection was first advanced by Thomas Wright and later enlarged upon by Margaret Ruth Lowery, their informal source of information having been William Muir. It deserves a fair hearing because Muir was explicit; that is, according to him, Blake’s parents “attended the Moravian Chapel in Fetter Lane”—and such a chapel did exist, having been established around 1738. Muir and Wright suggested the influence of Moravian hymns on Blake’s <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, while Lowery notes the “striking resemblance” between Blake’s “The Lamb” (E 8-9) and the Moravian James Hutton’s hymn, “O Lamb of God So Mild.”<ref target="n54" type="note">23</ref><note id="n54">23.

Pp. 14-15, 210 cite Muir, in correspondence with Wright and Lowery, as the source of the Moravian argument.</note></p>
          <p>In 1743 the names “Mr. and Mrs. Blake” appeared on the register of the Fetter Lane Society, at a time when seventy-two members formed “The Congregation of the Lamb,” a society “within the Church of England in union with the Moravian Brethren.” The Blake couple were perhaps William’s grandparents, James Blake’s parents. And it even may be that the Mr. and Mrs. Parker on the 1743 list were the parents of Blake’s later business partner, James Parker. When William Muir wrote to Margaret Ruth Lowery in 1936, claiming that Blake’s parents attended the Moravian Chapel in Fetter Lane, he may merely have seen the list transcribed by Abraham Reincke and published in 1873:

On the other hand, Muir may just possibly have been drawing on some family tradition that originated with his great-great-uncle Alexander Tilloch, a friend of Blake’s, or his great-great-aunt Margaret Tilloch, Alexander’s sister.<ref target="n56" type="note">25</ref><note id="n56">25.

          <p>In June 2001, M. K. Schuchard decided to take William Muir’s claims about the Moravians seriously.<ref target="n57" type="note">26</ref> Informed by Davies of the existence of a Moravian Church Library and
<pb id="p38-39" n="39"/>
Archive (5-7 Muswell Hill, London N10 3TJ), she visited the library and discovered there several documents by Catherine and Thomas Armitage and by John Blake. Schuchard and Davies then made further exploration of this important archive. The results have proved to be of the first importance for an understanding of Blake’s biography and will have serious implications for the study of his works. <note id="n57">26. Schuchard had earlier discussed possible Moravian influences on Blake in “Why Mrs. Blake Cried: Swedenborg, Blake, and the Sexual Basis of Spiritual Vision,” <hi rend="i">Esoterica</hi> 2 (September 1999): 45-93 &lt;http://www.esoteric.msu.edu&gt;. The new Moravian findings will be fully explored in her book-length expansion of the article, forthcoming from Random House, London.</note></p>
          <p>There are a number of references in the archive to members of a Blake family. Thus, in November 1749: “Sister Blake an old member of the Society went to our Saviour.”<ref target="n58" type="note">27</ref> Or this in 1742: “Blake is a poor vexed man, a Slave.”<ref target="n59" type="note">28</ref> There is even a petition for membership in the Congregation of the Lamb addressed by one John Blake “For Brother Beoler”:<ref target="n60" type="note">29</ref><q>
Dear Brother Beoler I have a Desire to write to you and to our Saviour’s Dear Congregation that I may come in a Closer connexont with them, that I may injoy those privilidged with our Dear Saviour as his Congregation have.

Conceivably this could be the John Blake, perhaps James Blake’s brother or uncle, resident like him at 5 Glasshouse Street in 1743.<ref target="n62" type="note">31</ref> The letter is typical of such requests for membership in the congregation; its stress on the blood and wounds of Christ is fully in accord with contemporary Moravian spirituality. <note id="n58">27.

                            <p>Do you want me? Do you receive me? Am I acceptable to you? Do I please your heart? See, here I am! This is the way I look . . .

          <p>All this, of course, is speculation, but of much the greatest importance are the references to a Moravian Church member called Thomas Armitage (already established as the name of Blake’s mother’s first husband). Thus, in the Congregation Diary for 1751:

Could this really be Catherine Blake’s first husband? Confirmatory data can be found in the Church Book of “The Congregation of the Lamb . . . as Settled Octr 30 1742. in London,” which contains a tabulated list of members. Thus, we find an entry for

          <p>We thus see that, in 1750-51, the Moravian congregation at Fetter Lane included a young couple, Thomas and Catherine Armitage, and Thomas has the place and approximate date of birth (Royston, Yorkshire, 1723 for 1722), the profession (hosier), and the death in November 1751, already established for Catherine Blake’s first husband. What is more, the archive includes documents from their hands. Persons wishing to participate fully in the Congregation of the Lamb were encouraged

23 Nov. 1751. Sabb. L.F. was at Westminster. Today was buried in Bloomsbury Ground the Body of Thomas Armitage a married Br. He was born in the Parish of Royson in Yorkshire, in May 1723, married at London, &amp; was by trade a Hosier. He was receiv’d into the Congregation, Nov. 26 1750, and partook of the H. covenant on his sick bed, Sept. 28 1751. His sickness was a slow Consumption, of which he died last Tuesday Morning. Towards the latter end a little Fretfulness clouded his Love, which he always bore to his nearest Hearts; but the Night before he departed, he desired they would forgive him this, &amp; took a cordial Leave afterwards of his Wife.<ref target="n67" type="note">36</ref><note id="n67">36.

The letter, we see, ends with a quotation from a Moravian hymn.<ref target="n69" type="note">38</ref> Here is irrefutable evidence of Blake’s mother’s religious convictions, her literacy (perhaps, too, showing where her son got his eccentric spelling from), and the intimacy with Moravian hymns that Muir drew our attention to. <note id="n69">38.

          <p>The “Walkingham” of the Moravian Church Book where Catherine Wright was born in 1725 is the little Nottinghamshire village of Walkeringham,<ref target="n70" type="note">39</ref> some twenty-four miles from Cudworth, Yorkshire, where her first husband, Thomas Armitage, was born in 1722. Walkeringham stands on the west bank of the Trent, about one mile from where the ferry crossed to Walkerith, in Lincolnshire. In 1801, the earliest date for which census information is available, the population of the village was 419. It has remained a small community, the population being 859 in 1991. Epworth, where John Wesley was born in 1703, and where John Varley’s father, Richard, originated, is six miles away. <note id="n70">39. Ordnance Survey Grid Ref.: SK766927.</note></p>

          <p>According to the parish register of the church of St. Mary Magdalen at Walkeringham (illus. 3), Catherine, daughter of Gervase Wright and his wife Mary, was christened 21 November 1725 (illus. 4).<ref target="n71" type="note">40</ref> (The entries in <hi rend="i">FamilySearch</hi> for Walkeringham parish through a dating error put Catherine’s birth into 1726. Hence she did not show up in the trawl for a Catherine Wright born before 1725 that Davies recorded in his 1999 paper.) Gervase and Mary Wright had eight children:
<q>
Richard, christened 29 April 1715;<lb/>
Katharin, christened 15 October 1718, died young;<lb/>
Robert, christened 6 February 1717;<lb/>
John, christened 1 January 1720;<lb/>
Elizabeth, christened 30 January, died October 1722;<lb/>
Elizabeth, christened 6 April 1724;<lb/>
Catherine, christened 21 November 1725;<lb/>
Benjamin, christened 23 September 1729.
</q>
William Blake now has uncles and an aunt. Most of their names recur for the Blake children. But none of the Blake children are named after their maternal grandfather, Gervase. Had Catherine quarreled with her father? Or is it just that “Gervase” is too much of a “country-bumpkin” name for an upwardly mobile London family? Her mother Mary’s name is also conspicuously absent. Catherine’s brother Benjamin, who married Elizabeth Whitehead in 1754, has children Richard (born 1759), Elizabeth (1763), Catherine (1766), Thomas (1769), and Mary (1772). Again, none of the sons are given their paternal grandfather’s name.<ref target="n72" type="note">41</ref><note id="n71">40.

          <p>The Wrights of Walkeringham were yeoman farmers and maltsters. The Archdeaconry wills, now in Nottinghamshire County archives, include those of several members of the family. Benjamin Wright, yeoman, in his will, proven 12 February 1685 O.S. (1686 N.S.), left £5 to the poor of the parish, with a number of legacies and bequests of sheep. Gervase Wright, maltster and yeoman, perhaps Catherine’s grandfather, was comfortably off; the inventory of his estate, 7 October 1700, includes malt worth £120 out of a total value of the estate of £384. The village origins of Blake’s mother suggest the possibility of linking Blake with a surviving peasant culture and not just the emerging urban proletarian one so often assumed.<ref target="n73" type="note">42</ref> We need further work on the Archdeaconry wills to learn more about her father’s family and the rural milieu in which she grew up. <note id="n73">42. Perhaps John Adlard, <hi rend="i">The Sports of Cruelty: Fairies, Folk-Songs, Charms and Other Country Matters in the Work of William Blake</hi> (London: C. &amp; A.

          <p>This present paper, modifying Davies’s own published work (itself corrective of previous scholarship), indicates how much inaccurate or incomplete information abounds about even the most basic details of Blake’s life. The intuitions of William Muir, of Margaret Ruth Lowery, and of Nancy Bogen as to the influence on Blake of Moravian hymnody are now shown to have some basis in fact; without Muir’s assertions, the Moravian archive would have been left unexplored. In a second paper in preparation we shall consider a few of the Blakean topics which now demand attention—his relationship with “heart religion,” his eclectic combination of different strands of culture, the importance of music, his view of childhood and of Jesus. For Blake scholars, the discovery of the Armitage and Blake documents in the Moravian archives at Muswell Hill opens up a new frontier in Blake studies.</p>

          <p>If you don’t know Morton Paley’s work you have probably picked up this copy of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> by accident. If you are a regular reader there is a fair chance that you know Morton Paley himself—may have heard him lecture, seen him at a conference, or may think of him as a friend. The prolific, indefatigable and much-travelled Paley is surely one of the best-<hi rend="i">known</hi> scholars of Romanticism we have. This volume is dedicated to him in honor of “his outstanding contribution to the study of Romanticism,” and aims to build on his groundbreaking work.</p>
          <p>In a brisk introduction, Tim Fulford explains that Paley puts millenarianism at the center of English Romanticism, as the focus for the hopes and fears of a turbulent period. Paley shows that repression, industrialization and war made it increasingly hard for writers to imagine the age of peace and happiness that should follow an age of apocalyptic destruction. “Romanticism, on this model, becomes a struggle not just to envision a new age but to retain the capacity for vision at all,” a struggle that produces ambivalence and pathos. This collection of essays aims to build on Paley’s example, offering a “historically contextualized examination of genres, styles and figures in literary and artistic works.” As is often the case in such collections, the volume is actually a mixture of occasional essays and reports of ongoing research. Some items relate closely to the title of the book, while some make only cursory gestures towards it. Some extend well-established lines of enquiry, some break genuinely new ground. But all have something useful to say.</p>
          <p>As we might expect, the volume gives much emphasis to the 1790s, but it spreads its attention widely to bring into the foreground works and figures who would once have been barely mentioned in this context. In an illuminating essay on “Cowper’s Ends,” for example, Adam Rounce argues persuasively that Cowper’s projection of endings makes him a more central figure in the end of the eighteenth century than is usually recognized. Rounce finds recurrent millennial and apocalyptic anxieties in Cowper’s work—including “Yardley Oak” and “On the Ice Islands”—shaped by his relationship with the poetry
<pb id="p38-44" n="44"/>
and artistic model of John Milton. Cowper lacked Milton’s rootedness and certainty, and was inclined to retreat from the evils of the present into an unreachable mythic past. His sense of personal guilt led him to identify himself with Satan the reprobate—not the glorious rebel of Blake and Shelley, but a figure with something of the ruined grandeur of Milton’s character, and sharing his sense of absolute alienation from any scheme of eternal reward. His work as a poet offered no restoration, since Cowper saw postlapsarian writing as a corrupt form of communication, and was therefore perpetually inscribing his own failure as he wrote. In Rounce’s attentive reading, Cowper emerges less as “a man out of time” than a figure sharing with other writers of the 1790s a vision of “history as a cyclic mutable force that is finally unknowable.”</p>
          <p>Milton is a presiding presence in Peter J. Kitson’s essay, which argues that “the survival of a <hi rend="i">Miltonic</hi> political sublime has not received the attention it merits.” As Kitson defines it, Milton’s political sublime is an idiosyncratic blending of apocalyptic and millenarian rhetoric, as found in some prose works of the 1640s (<hi rend="i">Eikonoklastes</hi> and <hi rend="i">Areopagitica</hi>) as well as in book 12 of <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost.</hi> Kitson reminds us that although Burke depoliticized Milton’s writings while establishing him as the sublime poet for the Romantic age, Milton remained a fully political presence to a number of writers. Kitson identifies a protean “Unitarian Political Sublime” that is informed in various ways by Milton’s example. In the case of Joseph Priestley, Milton seems to offer a general precedent rather than a stylistic model, since “Priestley does not himself write in the sublime style.” But Milton is more clearly a model for Gilbert Wakefield’s “The Spirit of Christianity Compared with the Spirit of the Times in Great Britain,” as Kitson convincingly demonstrates. The essay ends with a brief examination of Coleridge’s “The Destiny of Nations” and “Religious Musings,” and suggests that the Miltonic political sublime was soon rendered obsolete by the “failure of the Revolution.” The discussion makes some useful connections between writers, and solves some of the problems entailed in the difficult task of isolating a discursive mode from a web of intersecting discourses, by defining that mode in terms broad enough to accommodate a diverse range of practices.</p>
          <p>The starting point of John Beer’s discussion of “Romantic Apocalypses” is Morton Paley’s observation that ideas of apocalypse and millennium tended to go together while remaining separable, so that at certain times people would concentrate on one or the other. The rapidly moving events of the 1790s prompted equally rapid shifts in interpretation (in the case of Blake and Coleridge, Beer suggests, interpretation might change month by month). But a clear pattern emerged from the first Romantics’ varying experiences of history: they underwent a change comparable to that attributed to the early Christians by twentieth-century theologians. That is, they came to believe the apocalypse had already happened in their own consciousness. Beer outlines this movement towards “‘internalized apocalypse’” in Blake (from the revolutionary apocalypse of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> to that centered on the Poetic Genius in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>) and in Wordsworth (as recorded in <hi rend="i">The Prelude</hi>), seeing both as a kind of “self-emptying.” He concludes with a discussion of “The Ancient Mariner,” a poem that can be seen as a symptom of a soured revolution (or “failed apocalypse”), but which also indicates the nature of Coleridge’s own internal revelation—that a poem could be “fraught with contradictions” and yet still unified. The premises of Beer’s essay seem common enough, but by establishing unexpected connections, he succeeds in rendering the familiar engagingly unfamiliar.</p>
          <p>Michael Simpson’s highly sophisticated, historically informed close reading of Coleridge’s “Fears in Solitude” begins with the question, “How can the poem denigrate newspapers in 1798 and then fall into one in 1802?” Simpson’s answer is that the poem was from the outset “constitutively uncomfortable with itself.” In its first printed version it had to engineer a symbolic escape not only from the mire of national rhetoric, but also from its own hypocritical polemic against that rhetoric. The move that eventually “re-situates the poem in the landscape of the dell” allows a positive version of the nation, constituted in “a language growing authentically out of nature into culture.” The subsequent selling of (part of) the poem in the context of the Treaty of Amiens can be read, Simpson argues, “as a moment of participation in a newly recharged matrix of commerce,” a moment that allows “a historical defusing of the poem’s topical anxiety.” Simpson leaves us with the image of the text “selling itself within a new dispensation of international commerce while haunted by its corona of exalted national poetry.” Within this complex and provocative reading, apocalypse assumes an unexpected form:
<q>

Simpson observes that the question concerning “our words” “bring[s] the apocalypse much closer to home than do comparable passages representing the war as apocalypse in either ‘Religious Musings’ or ‘The Destiny of Nations.’” The essay shows that an acute historicizing suspicion can coexist with a fine sensitivity to the affective power of poetic language.</p>
          <p>Nicholas Roe’s essay on Pantisocracy has a delightfully witty opening, which imagines a female reader in Cottle’s bookshop encountering Coleridge’s <hi rend="i">Poems on Various Subjects</hi>, glancing at a copy of <hi rend="i">The Watchman</hi> and reading “something at random about contributions welcomed from ‘Disciples of Paley.’” Part of the interest of the essay itself is its movement from the realm of ideals to “life as it was actually lived” by Coleridge and Southey from the later 1790s onwards. Roe sets out to investigate how Pantisocracy enabled the young writers “to move from the millennial prospect of a ‘blest future’ to the homely, domesticated scene of life in a rural cottage.” He focuses on the material side of the Pantisocratic venture—including the geographical location, the tools, equipment and supplies that would be needed (an account fleshed out with the help of Paul Muldoon’s <hi rend="i">Madoc: A Mystery</hi> and Coleridge’s own catalogue of domestic items drawn up as he began married life). The financial
<pb id="p38-45" n="45"/>
side of the enterprise is examined with reference to Adam Smith and to a land agent’s advice (recounted by Coleridge) which allows a glimpse of “colonizing as big business.” Roe considers how Pantisocracy would look (a circular layout, with its center a Unitarian meeting house) and provides a roll call of would-be Pantisocrats. The cumulative effect of such detail is to make the plan seem at once more and less realizable—on the one hand, just another proposed settlement among many others that were actually established in this period; on the other, a venture requiring a quite different kind of settler to bring it off. Roe sees one realization of the ideal closer to home, in the typical modern suburban lifestyle. The essay concludes with some brief but illuminating comments on Southey’s <hi rend="i">Poems</hi> of 1797, a collection in which “‘home’ seems to be mentioned only because it has been left behind, lost, or is out of reach.” If Pantisocracy was a practical scheme for domesticating the millenarian impulse, this collection, Roe argues, derives some of its coherence from “a faltering millenarianism for which Southey substitutes a domesticated sociable endeavor.” It is refreshing to read a discussion of Southey’s poems that does not condescend to the poet.</p>
          <p>Tim Fulford’s essay considers the relationship between orientalism and millenarianism in Southey’s work and in contemporary opinion. It is partly focused on Southey’s response to the MP Nathaniel Brassey Halhed, an orientalist scholar who became a follower of the popular prophet Richard Brothers, and who defended Brothers in Parliament when the Privy Council placed him in an asylum. In this lively account, Southey the writer of oriental epics recognized Halhed as his alter ego, accusing him of everything he had been accused of himself, and seeing him as the embodiment of a dangerous combination of orientalism and Jacobinism—all the more dangerous because of Halhed’s scholarly and political credentials. Southey’s fear is characteristically expressed as a fear of infection, a fear that leads him to think of fanaticism as “a disease of British India that might leave the educated unfit to govern the uneducated.” The second part of the essay focuses on Southey’s poetic use of female figures to image all that seemed dangerous to him in oriental beliefs. Fulford cites the case of the enchantress and witch Khawla in <hi rend="i">Thalaba</hi>, who represents Southey’s ambivalence to the power of religious belief to infect people—his attraction to, and fear of, “the millenarianism that . . . he wanted to extirpate from Britain.” From here it is a short step to Joanna Southcott, whom Halhed followed, and who was seen by Southey as witch-like and infectious, and the source of a superstition “like” the oriental disease of fanaticism. The essay offers a vivid episode in a larger story, in which anti-Jacobinism was rewritten as anti-Indianism, in a way that justified war in France and India, and the repression of those Irish who revealed an “Oriental” tendency to support radical politics.</p>
          <p>One of the strengths of Gary Harrison’s fine essay on “Ecological Apocalypse” is the way it draws out relationships between utopian dreams of improvement and dystopian nightmares in the Romantic period, and also relates them directly to our own era. Harrison notes that recent warnings about the consequences of human actions on a fragile environment (such as Rachel Carson’s <hi rend="i">The Silent Spring</hi>, 1962, and Bill McKibben’s <hi rend="i">The End of Nature</hi>, 1989) tend to deploy a “‘rhetoric of apocalypticism’” to enforce their message, and mostly rest on a fear of scarcity. In this they resemble the apocalyptic thinking of the era of Malthus, who saw the sublime specter of scarcity as an immutable law of nature. On the other hand, “our contemporary ideologues of progress,” like their earlier counterparts, “tend to overestimate the benefits of agricultural improvement, as well as the capacity of the earth to sustain agricultural growth.” Harrison shows that the Malthusian myth of ending and the myth of progress as promoted by Arthur Young and his followers both worked to “stigmatize the laboring poor as a subaltern presence that threaten[ed] the body politic with disorder, disease and ecological disaster.” Moreover, radicals such as Spence (whose vision of egalitarian plenty drew on Young’s optimistic projections) and Godwin (who countered Malthus by insisting on the earth’s infinite capacity to sustain life) “promoted an ideology of production that downplayed the limits of human technology and underestimated the biophysical limits of the earth.” Harrison suggests at one point that the myth of Malthus may serve to moderate the myth of progress that legitimates the domination of nature today. But he concludes, more tellingly, that we must “move beyond the dyad of famine and cornucopia and recognize the political limitations, as well as the rhetorical excesses, of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century ideologues of progress and apocalypse.” There is some circling and repetition in this essay—but its powerful argument establishes important continuities between the Romantic period and our own age.</p>
          <p>After a brief review of the male preoccupation with apocalypse in the Romantic period, Anne K. Mellor, in “Blake, the Apocalypse and Romantic Women Writers,” asks “why was the female imagination . . . on the whole <hi rend="i">not</hi> inspired by millenarian, apocalyptic thinking?” She argues that the sudden complete rupture between one cultural system and another (Foucault’s “epistemic break”) is antithetical to the “‘feminine mode of thought.’” She defines this mode—in terms developed by female epistemologists such as Nancy Hartsock and Sandra Harding—as “inter-relational and communitarian,” and seeks to ground it ultimately in biological differences. The biological grounding seems to me deeply problematic, since it depends on a severely reductive account of physiological processes, but Mellor frankly admits her explanations may be too simple. The important point is that women’s writing of the period “consistently represents time as continuous, as sustaining the production and reproduction of human communities.” She considers what appear to be three exceptions to the general rule, in order to show that they are not exceptional after all: Mary Anne Browne’s “A World without Water” (which “explicitly rejects as mere nightmarish fantasy the apocalyptic thinking that her male peers embraced,” since “her vision is <hi rend="i">only</hi> a dream”); Mary Shelley’s <hi rend="i">The Last Man</hi> (which tells not so much of the end of the world as the possibility of alternative beginnings, and warns of the dangers of a male-dominated world); and Joanna

Southcott (who could conceptualize the Second Coming of Christ only as a literal pregnancy and birth, only as an event in time). The essay contributes significantly to our developing sense of what is at stake in women’s writing of the period.</p>
          <p>Philip W. Martin argues that Byron’s <hi rend="i">Heaven and Earth</hi> and Moore’s <hi rend="i">The Loves of the Angels</hi> (both published in 1822) “can be read as liberal texts that set out to challenge the strong presence of Christian Evangelical criticism in the culture of the 1820s.” Both works require their readers to imagine an “impossible sexual act,” namely the copulation of angels with human women, which is the scandalous revelation of the newly rediscovered <hi rend="i">Book of Enoch</hi> (translated in a new version in 1821). Martin locates both works formally in the “literature of encounter,” representing the meeting between two separate kinds or species (a literature that ranges from historical encounters with the new world, to encounters with alien new worlds, and receives its power “by way of the uncanny”). His essay notes some literary antecedents in Donne and Milton, alludes to other orthodox, broadly moral versions, and offers some tantalizingly brief comments on the language of each work (noting that racial purity figures large in the language of Byron’s drama, while “Moore’s women are occasionally figured in the terminology of the promiscuous botany that Linnaeus and Darwin produced between them”). He concludes with a reference to Lamb’s essay “The Child Angel: A Dream,” a response to Moore’s poem, which imagines the offspring of the transgressive union to be an angelic child not a monster, or rather two children, locked into permanent childhood (and therefore beyond Buffon’s proof of species—the offspring’s capacity to reproduce). This figuring of unfulfilled potential provides a fitting endpoint for an essay that teasingly opens up more lines of inquiry than it has time to pursue.</p>
          <p>David Worrall’s “Robert Hawes and the Millenium Press: A Political Micro-Culture of Late Eighteenth-Century Spitalfields” delivers exactly what it promises. Worrall offers his account of a “micro-culture” in contrast to the “wider master narratives” (like those of Linda Colley and James Chandler) that promote an “imperial view of history that is not much help at the level of ground-zero local contemporary culture.” Working with modern bibliographical guides, contemporary pamphlets, materials from the Public Records Office and British Library Manuscripts Room, Worrall is able to reconstruct a vividly solid picture of the career and milieu of “the obscure Spitalfields pamphleteer, type-founder and printer Robert Hawes” which shows that “ideas of natural rights and resistive politics were dispersed into one of London’s most impoverished communities many years before the French Revolution.” The essay builds on material evidence of links between groups and individuals, supplemented by intelligent surmises. Worrall notes, for example, that the Swedenborgian Freemason Benedict Chastanier, whose project for a translated edition of Swedenborg claimed the support of the Duchess of Devonshire and William Pitt’s wife, included Hawes in the imprint of the first volume of the project. Hawes sold another Swedenborg volume on behalf of a “‘society of gentlemen,’” who “presumably” had links with the illuminist “Society of Avignon.” These links, proven and presumed, are “suggestive of the extreme social mobility of visionary religious discourses and how, in this instance, they were effortlessly co-opted into radical political agendas.” Worrall traces Hawes’s fascinating excursion into acrostics, the Home Office’s surveillance of him (predating the oppressive measures of the 1790s), his printing on tobacco papers for distribution in taverns—“No doubt the idea was to burn (or even ‘smoke’) the papers if spies were discovered in the room”—his response to Paine “the new Marvell”), his use of prophecy, his visits to Lord George Gordon in Newgate, and his connections with an embryonic workers’ cooperative in Spitalfields. In tracing such links, the essay brings into view the outlines of an intricate social fabric and a view of politics grounded in quotidian actions and events. In this area Worrall has located a rich vein of material evidence that he mines with great skil and enthusiasm, and that others will be able to make use of in the future. The essay ends with a coda concerning attempts to set up and regulate charitable food depots in Spitalfields in response to the immediate threat of starvation, attempts involving a kind of discourse that is, Worrall insists, remote from “the sort of reflexive ‘casuistry’ of events Chandler elaborates.” But the does not exactly cross swords with Chandler—they are standing too far apart for that.</p>
          <p>In a discussion of Blake’s Visionary Heads, G. E. Bentley, Jr., notes that most accounts of these drawings after 1820 take them either as evidence of madness or as something to be explained away. “Scarcely anyone allows for the possibility that Blake drew what he really saw and that what he saw was really there, an extraordinary or spiritual phenomenon.” Moreover, Blake’s art has often been taken as evidence of madness precisely because he represented the spiritual world “in forms disconcertingly like those of the material, tangible world.” Does Blake challenge or merely confirm our skepticism? Bentley reviews contemporary reactions to the artist, as well as to his work, noting how often those who met Blake concluded there was a touch of madness about him. By 1820, though, those who knew him found nothing wild about him, and “were struck by his serenity.” The Visionary Heads, produced around 1819-20, may therefore be seen as products of this serenity. Bentley is not concerned to judge or interpret these works, but to produce a comprehensive list of them. He identifies parts of “the Folio Blake-Varley sketchbook,” a work that has yet to be located, but that is mentioned in Allan Cunningham’s <hi rend="i">Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects</hi> (1830). Three Visionary Heads survive from the work (Pindar, Corinna and Lais), and three other titles are known. Bentley lists these, and also provides a list of all of the other Visionary Heads. The listing effectively provides a supplement to that in Martin Butlin’s two volume catalogue.<ref target="n74" type="note">1</ref><note id="n74">1.

          <p>In “Word as Image in William Blake” Martin Butlin casts his net wide in order to encompass the larger traditions to which Blake’s distinctive use of lettering can be related. He briefly reviews “the problem of the representation of God and the relationship of word and image that permeates the whole of Jewish, Christian and Islamic culture.” He suggests that Islam offers the most “extreme” solution, the exclusion of the human figure, and that in Islamic tradition iconography and decoration become literally the Word of God. He considers the shifting attitudes to figurative art in the Byzantine Church, in whose art lettering becomes an integral part of decoration, and notes that lettering also has an important part in the art of the churches of Rome. Having outlined these traditions, Butlin then traces the development of Blake’s interest in lettering, from the descriptive labeling of the scroll in “The Making of Magna Charta” (c. 1779) to the use of inscriptions in later works such as the epitome of James Hervey’s <hi rend="i">Meditations among the Tombs</hi> (c. 1820), the Job series, and the Laocoön. This is a careful, descriptive survey, which directs attention to connections and developments, while leaving us to ponder their significance for ourselves. Butlin concludes tentatively, and unexceptionally, that Blake perhaps unconsciously recreated in his own work “the emphasis on two rather than three dimensions and the combination of word and pictorial image found in early Christian and medieval religious art.”</p>
          <p>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick and Joseph Viscomi, in “The William Blake Archive: The Medium When the Millennium Is the Message,” describe the origin and rationale of the most important recent development in the publication of Blake’s works. When in the 1920s the pioneering editors D. J. Sloss (based in Rangoon) and J. P. R. Wallis (in Pretoria) published their landmark edition of Blake’s prophetic books, they lamented their disabling remoteness from each other and from “the centre of things.”<ref target="n75" type="note">2</ref> Now the medium itself is becoming the center of things, allowing scholars who live and work far apart to collaborate with ease. The Blake Archive brings together the formidable expertise of three major scholars, and, most remarkable, makes available, free to all who have the means of access, not only a large and growing range of Blake’s works, but also valuable contextual information, and the ability to “search” both text and images. Ten years ago we could hardly dream of such riches. This essay, another example of seamless collaboration (how, I wonder, does the writing actually happen?), explains the principles of inclusion and editing, and defines the larger aims of the project. The illuminated books are the core of the Archive, which will expand outwards “giving priority to significant interrelated clusters . . . such as the large color prints of 1795” and will eventually include Blake’s typographical works and his manuscripts. The authors note the severe limitations of printed editions of Blake, which have so far reproduced “a remarkably small subset of the books—not even a useful cross-section.” They rightly claim that “the dominant tradition of Blake editing has been overwhelmingly literary, ruthlessly discarding visual information,” and they may well be right to assume that “many students and even professional scholars know either the textual or visual side of Blake’s work but not both.” There will be no excuse for such neglect in future, since users of the Blake Archive “are positioned primarily not as readers but as viewers of a visual field.” When presented in such terms, the case for the Blake Archive seems overwhelming. However, readers might want to reflect upon the following sentence:
<q>
If we are going to contribute as we claim to the preservation of fragile originals that are easily damaged by handling, we must supply reproductions that scholars can depend upon in their research.
</q>
At this point I have a vision of conservators nodding vigorously in agreement, and I begin to feel distinctly uneasy. In the British Library special applications are now needed to see Blake manuscripts that were once available on request, and applicants are likely to be offered a facsimile in the first instance. The same restrictions could conceivably be applied to Blake’s illuminated books in future. Reproductions of those books will certainly be enormously useful to scholars in their research, but only up to a point. No art historians worthy of the name would be content to base their work on reproductions rather than originals. Tucked away in the notes of Martin Butlin’s essay is this brief statement:
<q>
I support [Michael] Phillips’s idea that color-printing involved two printings although [Joseph] Viscomi, supported by Robert N. Essick, believes that it was all done in one process.
</q>
Readers who have followed the debate between Viscomi/Essick on the one side, and Michael Phillips and Martin Butlin on the other, will know what is at stake here.<ref target="n76" type="note">3</ref> For the arguments about printing processes turn on such material particulars as the presence or absence of pinholes, on the fine texture of colored surfaces, on precisely those aspects of the physical object that are most difficult to register on the screen. Here, as in some other aspects of interpretation, there is no adequate substitute for the material object, however finely produced, useful, and pleasurable the virtual equivalent may be. Conservators take note. <note id="n75">2. D. J. Sloss and J. P. R. Wallis, eds., <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Prophetic Writings</hi>, 2 vols.

          <p>This collection of essays is intended to honor Morton Paley for his forty years of pioneering study of the culture of the Romantic period. It is an appropriate tribute, giving in its range a sense of the many-sidedness of Paley’s own work, which has been, in more than one sense, foundational.</p>
