John 6:12
</q>
          <p>1997 may have fallen just short of being an <hi rend="i">annus mirabilis</hi> for the Blake marketplace, but it can fairly lay claim to being an <hi rend="i">annus revelatio.</hi> The first month brought forth the first discovery: a previously-unrecorded impression, in a previously-unknown early state, of one of Blake’s original separate plates, “Lucifer and the Pope in Hell.” Further, this newly-discovered impression (see illus. 10 and compare to illus. 11 and 12) is a “touched” proof—that is, it bears pencil additions by Blake indicating further work to be considered for execution on the copperplate. As far as I can determine, this is the only extant touched proof of any of Blake’s separate plates. Such proofs help us understand Blake’s working methods and give us a brief glimpse of the printmaker thinking with his hands and eyes as he sketches with a pencil over a trial impression in an early state. Along with “Albion rose” and “The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder,” “Lucifer and the Pope in Hell” is one of Blake’s rarest separate plates. All three are products of the first half of the 1790s and express Blake’s radical political views of that period. Any comprehensive account of these views must consider their pictorial, and not just their textual, expression.</p>
          <p>Patrick Noon, formerly the Curator of Drawings and Prints at the Yale Center for British Art, recognized some time ago that an unattributed drawing in the Center’s collection was a work by Blake. This discovery was not announced until the publication of Noon’s catalogue for the Blake exhibition at the Center, 2 April through 6 July 1997. See illus. 8 and its caption for the drawing and information about it.</p>
          <p>John Windle, the San Francisco book dealer who specializes in Blake and his circle, was as usual in London in June to exhibit at one, and attend all, of the annual book fairs. He also paid a visit to Christie’s, where he found a rather ordinary copy of the Job engravings. Tucked within this volume was something extraordinary—a copy of plates 25-27 of Blake’s <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, accompanied by a handwritten note by the collector Frank Rinder. A brief glance at Bentley’s <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> proved to Windle that he had rediscovered copy M of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>, untraced since its sale at the great Linnell auction of 1918. Christie’s offered copy M for sale on 26 November. Bidding was surprisingly muted and Windle, acting for the Bentley collection of Toronto, had to battle only against the reserve (the price below which the auction house will not sell a specific lot). Thus, with a bid of just £9,000 (£10,350 with the buyer’s premium), Windle acquired the prize. See illus. 4 and its caption for details about copy M.</p>
          <p>One further plate from an illuminated book changed hands in 1997. <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> plate 1, sometimes titled “The Ancient of Days” or “God Creating the Universe,” is probably Blake’s best-known design and arguably among the most famous images in the English-speaking world. The impression formerly owned by the artist and printer Leonard Baskin has now migrated into my collection (illus. 1). It is the first original print of “The Ancient of Days” to appear on the market since 1970, when Paul Mellon purchased the version in brown ink, now in the Yale Center for British Art, from the New Haven book dealer C. A. Stonehill. For reproductions and some new information (or at least speculations) about “The Ancient of Days,” see illus. 1-3 and their captions.</p>
          <p>Early in August, a woman of some years walked into the London, Bond Street, shop of Marlborough Rare Books. She carried a shopping bag containing three volumes: a late nineteenth-century edition of <hi rend="i">The Pilgrim’s Progress</hi>; an album of magazine and newspaper clippings about Shakespeare, mostly dating from the 1920s; and George Cumberland’s copy of Blake’s 1809 <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>, last recorded by Cumberland in his journal in November 1809 and the only traced example remaining in private hands. These books had been acquired by the woman’s late father many years ago. I have no information about the destiny of the first two works; after some complex but friendly negotiations, with Michael Brand of Marlborough and John Windle acting as intermediaries, the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> made its way into my collection. The printed text is richly supplemented, with unique annotations by Blake, a flyleaf note by Cumberland (“They say Blake was mad: If so Shakespeare &amp; Milton were so too....”), and two letters by John Linnell. See the entry below under “First Editions of Blake’s Writings” and illus. 5-7 and their captions for more information on this slender but intriguing pamphlet.</p>
          <p>The Tate Gallery has long been the possessor and exhibitor of 10 of Blake’s 12 large color prints, designed and first executed in 1795. The missing designs were <hi rend="i">Naomi Entreating Ruth and Orpah</hi> (impressions are in the Fitzwilliam Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum) and <hi rend="i">Satan Exulting over Eve</hi> (Getty Museum and collection of the artist John Craxton). The Craxton impression of <hi rend="i">Satan Exulting</hi> was acquired by the Tate early in 1997. This purchase, assisted by several charitable institutions and private individuals, was made as a most fitting tribute to Martin Butlin,
<pb id="p31-109" n="109"/>
formerly the Keeper of the British Collection at the Tate and, as all readers of this journal will know, one of the great Blake scholars of this century. On arrival at the Tate, the print was almost invisible because of one or more coats of dark brown varnish. There may also be some rather clumsy restorations under the varnish, particularly on Satan’s face. The Gallery’s conservation department hopes to improve the print’s appearance by the time you are reading this.</p>
          <p>The first Blake drawing to appear at auction in 1997 did exceedingly well. His light and sketchy (a dealer would say “delicate and sensitive”) preliminary drawing of the <hi rend="i">Last Judgment</hi> (Butlin #643) was offered by Christie’s London on 8 April with an estimate of £4000-6000. Even though the fullpage illustration in the auction catalogue rendered the image almost invisible, spirited bidding by agents acting for two collectors drove the winning bid to £10,500. With the addition of auction-house fees, agents fees, value-added tax on the former, and a strong pound, the final cost approached $20,000. This I believe is a record price for one of Blake’s documentary drawings with little visual impact. Perhaps the subject alone, so important to Blake, stimulated the market. I have not yet been able to discover the identity of the new owner. My best guess—and it is no more than that—is that the successful bidder was the same British private collector who acquired Blake’s illustrations to Bunyan’s <hi rend="i">Pilgrim’s Progress</hi> in 1996.</p>
          <p>On 13 November, Sotheby’s London offered, in one lot and in one frame, two of Blake’s preliminary drawings for his 1821 Virgil wood engravings (illus. 9). Although not a completely unanticipated discovery like the early state of “Lucifer and the Pope in Hell,” these wash drawings must surely count as an important rediscovery. They were last recorded in the now legendary 1939 Blake exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the catalogue of which names “Dr. Frederick T. Murphy” as their owner. Sotheby’s estimate of £8000-12,000 for the pair was ludicrously low, particularly since the New York branch of the same firm sold a single Virgil drawing for $79,750 in 1992 (Butlin #769.19, now in the collection of Maurice Sendak). The print-dealer Nicholas Lott (formerly of Connecticut, now of Bath, England) was a witness to the drama and reports that the bidding was “a real battle,” with considerable telephone activity, contestants jumping in and out of the fray, and a suspense-generating pace with increments of only £1000. The drawings were finally knocked down to Lott, acting for me, at £64,000 (£71,900 with the buyer’s premium added). Over the last 15 years, several of the Virgil drawings have changed ownership; for a complete accounting of their present whereabouts and other information on the Virgil designs, see Appendix 2, below.</p>
          <p>The Virgil drawings were sold in the morning of the 13th; in the afternoon, Sotheby’s offered a large (739 lots) collection of late eighteenth-century British etchings, engravings, and mezzotints in many genres, from historical to landscape to caricature. All had been in the same family since their original purchase at or near the time of publication. The group included a stunning collection of separate prints after Fuseli (11 prints in seven lots), with three printed in colors. The sale also placed on offer a rare copy engraving by Blake (“Venus Dissuades Adonis from Hunting” after Richard Cosway) and prints after John Hamilton Mortimer and James Barry (prints by both artists gathered into just one lot each). All lots bore surprisingly high estimates; all are recorded below under the name of their designers. A selection of significant works by Blake’s circle and followers are reproduced here as illus. 13-17.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the most exciting revelations of 1997 came late in the year: the rediscovery of “The Ancient of Days” copy D (see illus. 3) and the discovery of a previously unknown letter of 1 Sept. 1800 from Blake to George Cumberland, three pages long and concluding with seven lines of verse. An article about the letter, with of course reproductions and a transcription, is now in preparation by Morton Paley and myself for publication in the next issue of this journal.</p>
          <p>It is remarkable, as the twentieth century slouches to a close, that Blakean treasures of the sort recorded here are still coming to light. It gives the collector, curator, and materialist scholar hope for the next millennium. We are already seeing Blake reduced to 1 and 0, pixels per square inch (the modern equivalent of stipple engraving—of which Blake was both a master and a severe critic), and other Newtonian and discontinuous quantifications of the ideology of a line continuous in its minutest subdivisions (see Blake’s letter to Cumberland, 12 April 1827, E 783); but the <hi rend="i">retardataire</hi> romanticists and children among us will continue to worship the Benjaminesque “aura” of what they privilege as the original, the autographic. Photography has yet to destroy the market for paintings; the internet has yet to supersede the pieces of ink-spattered paper you are holding in your hands (or those that Blake held in his). “Progress” in this arena is supplementary, not supplantive. Just follow the money.</p>
          <p>Sadly, I must again record the death of a fellow Blake collector. George Armin Goyder, associated for many years with the Blake Trust and other Blakean activities in Britain, died early in 1997. As I recorded in my 1995 sales review (<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 29 [1996]: 111), two of the Blake tempera paintings from the Goyder collection, <hi rend="i">Christ the Mediator</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Flight into Egypt</hi> (Butlin #429, 404), are on long-term loan to the Tate Gallery; both were on public exhibit when I visited the Tate in late March and early April 1997. George was a dedicated Christian, long active in the Church of England. His religious faith and his love of Blake were intimately connected. Most appropriately, a memorial service was held on 2 April 1997 in St. James’s Church, Piccadilly—the church in which Blake was baptized. Celebrations of George’s life and achievements were presented by several of his business associates and friends, including Martin
<pb id="p31-110" n="110"/><figure n="Europe.c.P1" rend="file"><head>1 <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, pl. 1 (“The Ancient of Days”), from copy c.</head><figDesc>Relief and white-line etching, 2nd (published) st., etched 1794 and printed in a bright, medium blue ink showing a greenish hue under some lighting conditions. The Pantone Matching System ink color (3155U) closest to this print is a mixture of blue, green, and black in a ratio of approx. 13:6:1. Image and plate-mark 23.4 × 16.8 cm., sheet of unwatermarked wove paper 24.4 × 17.7 cm. Essick collection. Copy c of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> is not a “copy” collated as such by Blake, but a convenient scholarly invention by Geoffrey Keynes and Edwin Wolf 2nd for labeling most of the miscellaneous impressions from <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> bound, by George A. Smith in about 1853, with other prints by Blake and his manuscript “Order” of the <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> (see Keynes and Wolf, <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Illuminated Books: A Census</hi> [New York: Grolier Club, 1953] 80). Since copy c includes both lifetime and posthumous impressions, including posthumous pulls of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pls. 4 and 5 (Essick collection, designated as 4<hi rend="s">a</hi> and 5<hi rend="s">a</hi> in Bentley 143, 340), it is reasonable to suspect—as both collectors and dealers have in recent times—that the print reproduced here falls into the latter, far less important, category. The evidence, however, indicates that Blake (perhaps, of course, with the assistance of his wife Catherine) printed this impression in 1794. The blue-green ink is consistent with the range of blues and greens we find in the illuminated books etched and printed 1793-94, such as <hi rend="i">America</hi> copy R (American private collection) and proof copy a of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (British Museum). The latter has several pls. in early states (including the unique impression of the 1st st. of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pl. 1) and thus must contain some of the earliest extant impressions pulled. In contrast, no definitely posthumous impressions of Blake’s relief etchings are in any shade of blue or green ink; all are printed in black (which looks gray when thinly printed), brick red, or orange. The printing of the etching borders along the upper right margin and top margin of the plate reproduced here might suggest a posthumous pull, but the appearance of the print in these areas is consistent with the impression in dark blue ink in the Keynes Collection, Fitzwilliam Museum (see the color illus. in John Milton, <hi rend="i">Poems in English with Illustrations by William Blake</hi> [London: Nonesuch P, 1926] 2:facing 188), and the impression in brown ink in the Yale Center for British Art (see the color illus. in <hi rend="i">The Human Form Divine: William Blake from the Paul Mellon Collection</hi>, exhibition cat. by Patrick Noon [New Haven: Yale Center for British Art, 1997] 29). The Yale Center impression is a particularly useful touchstone because it bears on its verso an impression of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl. 30, printed in brown and black and hand colored by Blake. Thus, “The Ancient of Days” on the recto was almost certainly printed, complete with the etching borders top and upper right margins, by Blake. Most important, the reticulated or maculated texture of the ink in the print illustrated here, most evident in the larger relief areas, is typical of Blake’s printing and not to be found, in my experience, in posthumous impressions, all characterized by flat and even printed surfaces. This key difference (as Joseph Viscomi was the first to observe) may be due to Blake’s use of intaglio ink, while Frederick Tatham, who appears to have undertaken the posthumous printings, probably used a thinner relief ink. The numerous inking flaws in posthumous impressions, usually the result of weak inking in one or more areas, are easily distinguished from Blake’s own reticulated patterns. The Whatman-type wove paper of this “Ancient of Days,” .21 mm. thick, is within the range (approx. .16-.26 mm.) of papers Blake used in 1793-95. The recto/verso impressions of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pls. 11 and 17 in my collection are on paper of only marginally heavier weight (.26 mm. thick) and almost identical in color, texture, and density. Since pl. 17 on this sheet is in the first of two states, it must have been printed by Blake. In contrast, posthumous impressions 4<hi rend="s">a</hi> and 5<hi rend="s">a</hi> from <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> copy c are on slightly thinner paper, .17 mm. thick, with a smoother and harder surface. The T STAINS/1813 paper used for posthumous copy L of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> is exceptionally thin at only .12 mm.<lb/><lb/>
Posthumous impressions of Blake’s relief etchings are generally larger than those pulled by Blake himself (Bentley 67). This difference is probably due to Blake’s dampening his paper, which then shrank during drying, while Tatham used dry paper (see Viscomi, <hi rend="i">Blake and the Idea of the Book</hi> [Princeton: Princeton UP, 1993] 99-100). The only posthumous impression of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pl. 1 available to me for measurement, present in copy L, is 2 mm. taller and 1 mm. wider than the print reproduced here. Thus its smaller dimensions suggest that this impression was printed by Blake, although I would hesitate to base a firm attribution on such slight differences alone. Yet the accumulated evidence concerning size, ink color and texture, printing style, and paper thickness and texture makes me reasonably confident that we can add the print reproduced here to the brief list (Fitzwilliam, Yale Center) of uncolored but handsomely-printed separate impressions of “The Ancient of Days” produced by Blake in 1794. All three may have been pulled by Blake as separate prints unrelated to the production of complete copies of <hi rend="i">Europe.</hi><lb/><lb/>
Bentley records the history of this print accurately, as part of the “Order” of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> volume, to the George C. Smith auction in 1938. He then states, p. 340, that this “Ancient of Days” was subsequently sold by the Philadelphia book dealer Charles Sessler to Moncure Biddle, and then “bought again at his [Biddle’s] sale” by Sessler. However, no impression of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pl. 1 appears in the Biddle auction, Parke-Bernet, New York, 29-30 April 1952. Sessler’s acquisition and sales records, xeroxed or carefully transcribed for me years ago by Michael Young, indicate the following provenance for this print from 1938 onwards: G. C. Smith sale, Parke-Bernet, 2 Nov. 1938, in #29, printed in “green” (sic) and “inlaid to size” (i.e., glued on all four margins of the verso to a backing sheet with a window cut into it to reveal the verso of the print), offered with <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pls. 4<hi rend="s">a</hi> and 5<hi rend="s">a</hi> from copy c, both printed in “sepia” and similarly “inlaid to size” (Sessler, $245 plus a commission of 10% for Biddle); the “Ancient of Days” only on consignment with Sessler’s from the Biddle collection by March 1957; acquired 28 March 1957 by “Dan[s?] Grubb” for $54; acquired by (or on consignment with) Sessler for $60 from Grubb, 13 Feb. 1964; sold by Sessler for $175 to Leonard Baskin, 30 June 1964. To this record I can add the sale, in May 1997, of this print by Baskin (through his son, the book dealer Josiah Baskin) to the San Francisco book dealer John Windle, and the purchase of the print by R. Essick from Windle in the same month. At some point after its 1938 sale at auction, the print was removed from the mounting sheet; evidence of its previous mounting is provided by the stained margins and glue spots still present on all four edges of the verso. The disfiguring propensities of this former attachment have percolated through to the recto and slightly stained its margins; other unprinted areas of the sheet are fresh and retain their original color and texture.<lb/><lb/>
When printing from his copperplate of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pl. 1, Blake treated the figure’s lower right leg and foot in several different ways. The unique first-state impression (proof copy a, British Museum) shows that Blake etched a thick vertical line as a crude indication of the man’s right foot, but failed to articulate the relationship between foot and lower leg. The result is a gap (produced by an etched, recessed area that does not print) between the vague indications of the lower right leg and rudimentary foot. We see the same etched image in post-humous copy M (Fitzwilliam Museum). All other impressions printed by Blake show that he tried to handle this problematic area of his image in three different ways. In the final two impressions that he printed and colored (pl. 1 in copy K [Fitzwilliam Museum] and the separate impression in the Whitworth Institute, Manchester), Blake carefully painted in the lower right leg and foot. With the exception of the impression reproduced here and the proof in copy a, all others show that Blake tinted this area on each print to form a deeply-shadowed passage, in effect cancelling any attempt to represent the lower right leg or foot. This impression is close to the proof in copy a, but some ink has been dragged from the lower left portion of the right leg into the white area between leg and foot. Although this smeared ink looks at first glance like a mere accident, the specificity of its location suggests that Blake may have purposefully wiped some ink right to left on the plate (left to right in the impression) in an unsuccessful attempt to print the shadow he produced by hand tinting on most other impressions.<lb/><lb/>

The impressions presented in illus. 1 and 3 have not been reproduced since Muir’s facsimile of 1887 (illus. 2).</figDesc></figure><pb id="p31-112" n="112"/><figure n="muir-europe-1.031.04.bqscan" rend="file"><head>2 William Muir after William Blake, <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pl. 1, 2nd (published) st., used in Muir’s 1887 facsimile of the illuminated book.</head><figDesc>Photo-lithograph printed in dark gray-blue, uncolored (proof?) impression, image 23.5 × 17 cm., printed framing lines 24.8 × 18.2 cm. Essick collection. On the cover sheet for his reproduction of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> Muir states that “The Ancient of Days” is based on an original “in Mr. Muir’s possession.” As Bentley 339 states, the “Order” of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> volume, including pls. from <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> copy c, was in Muir’s possession from no later than 1886 to at least 1887, when the volume was offered for sale by Quaritch. Bentley further speculates (339, 489) that <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pl. 1 in Muir’s 1887 facsimile was based on an impression in copy c. We are now in a position to confirm Bentley’s observations and be more specific about the basis of Muir’s work. The pattern of printing accidents, particularly along the right margin, indicates that the impression of “The Ancient of Days” reproduced here as illus. 1 was the model for Muir’s reproduction. The white area just left of the man’s right foot contains fragments of the ink smears present in illus. 1 (see its caption for Blake’s various treatments of this passage). Muir’s production methods would have led him to make a photo-lithograph from an uncolored original, in order to capture the etched image, and then color it according to some other impression (see illus. 3). The presence of framing lines, absent from Muir’s other reproductions of pls. from <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, can be explained by the hand-drawn framing lines still present on the mounting sheets of other pls. bound with the “Order” of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, including <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, copy c, pls. 4<hi rend="s">a</hi> and 5<hi rend="s">a</hi>. Muir simply reproduced the hand-drawn framing lines on the mounting sheet to which the original (illus. 1) was then glued, even though these lines are not Blake’s work.</figDesc></figure><pb id="p31-111" n="111"/><pb id="p31-113" n="113"/><figure n="Europe.P1.Bentley109imp" rend="file"><head>3 <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pl. 1, the impression designated as “Ancient of Days” copy D in Bentley 109, 339, and 340.</head><figDesc>Relief and white-line etching, 1794, 2nd (published) st., printed in very dark blue (described as “black” in the George C. Smith auction cat., Parke-Bernet, 2 Nov. 1938, #28). Hand tinted in thin water-color washes, with strawberry-red filling the disc of the sun and some of the surrounding clouds. Image, platemark, and sheet size approx. the same as for illus. 1, above. This impression was shown in Sept. 1975 to Ruth Fine, Curator of the Rosenwald Collection, then located at the Alverthorpe Gallery, Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. She photographed the print and sent a black and white glossy photo to me in Oct. 1975. In Dec. 1997, I was contacted by a friend of the present owner, a New York private collector. According to the owner, this is the impression sold from the A. E. Newton collection, Parke-Bernet, 16 April 1941, #130 ($175—perhaps not sold but “bought-in” at that price). Bentley 109 suggests that the Newton impression is the print now in the estate of George Goyder, but this seems unlikely because the Goyder impression is a Muir facsimile printed in golden yellow. The present owner of the impression reproduced here further states that it was formerly in the collections of Caroline Newton, A. E. Newton’s daughter, and the poet W. H. Auden (1907-1973), from whom he acquired the print by bequest. A color photo shown to me reveals that this impression is still mounted to a backing sheet with brown-ink framing lines typical of works bound with the “Order” of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (see captions to illus. 1-2 for comments on these characteristics).<lb/><lb/>
The reticulations in the ink of this print, so similar to those represented in illus. 1, indicate that it is an impression pulled by Blake. I have not seen the original, and thus hesitate to attribute the hand tinting to Blake or anyone else. The print was shown to Joseph Viscomi at the Pierpont Morgan Library in mid-January 1998. In his opinion, the impression was pulled by Blake but colored by another hand, perhaps many years later. Surprisingly, the colors and placement of the washes in this impression are generally consistent with what we see in colored impressions of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pl. 1 in Muir’s 1887 facsimile of the illuminated book. Thus, while the impression reproduced here as illus. 1 very probably served as Muir’s source for his photo-lithograph (illus. 2), this other impression of “The Ancient of Days,” then in Muir’s possession as part of the “Order” of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> volume, may have been the model for his hand coloring. If indeed this is the case, then it seems improbable that anyone in the Muir group added the coloring to the original, for why would anyone base a Blake facsimile on coloring known to be by someone else? Muir’s separate print of “The Ancient of Days” may have been printed from the same lithographic plate (or “zincograph”) from which the print in illus. 2 was pulled, but he printed the separate issue in golden yellow (rather than dark gray-blue) and colored it on the basis of a very different original (probably pl. 1 in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> copy D, in the British Museum since 1859). A few examples of this separate facsimile were printed before the addition of the framing lines—or possibly from a different lithographic plate.

San Francisco Book Fair, complete set, printing uncertain but probably c. 1892, the Moncure Biddle and Garden Inc. copy, full green morocco folding case ($50,000). Both Heald and I have seen several sets (including the next below) in the same style of morocco folding case, probably made c. 1880-1910. Perhaps such cases were supplied by the Linnell family to customers who bought sets of the Dante pls. directly from them. Heritage Book Shop, March cat. for the New York Book Fair, #18, complete set, printing uncertain but probably c. 1892, with the printed label, full green morocco folding case, Philip Hofer’s copy with his bookplate ($45,000). Pls. 1, 2, 5-6 only, the 1st on laid India, the other 3 find and early impressions directly on laid paper, acquired 1st half of 1997 by the Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, by bequest from Adolph Weil, Jr., who acquired the prints from the London dealer William Weston, who had acquired them (plus pls. 3 and 7 on laid paper) at CL, 29 June 1989, #13, pl. 2 illus.

Relief etchings, 1790, printed in dark brown ink, pl. 25 in the 1st st., all but part of the heading of the “Chorus” on pl. 27 not printed, on a single sheet of “laid” (according to Christie’s auction cat. of 26 Nov. 1997, but actually wove) paper folded down the middle to form a pamphlet of 2 leaves, sheet approx. 19.9 × 24.3 cm., “three” (according to the auction cat., but actually 2) deckle edges top and one side, other edges torn and/or cut (edges of the sheet not shown in this illus.). When folded into two leaves, the first recto is blank but bears an inscription probably by Frank Rinder: “Pages from Blake’s ‘Marriage of Heaven and Hell’ (pubd in 1790) (Etched by Blake).” Opening shown here bearing pls. 25 (on the left, the verso of the 1st leaf) and 26 (on the right, the recto of the 2nd leaf). Pl. 27 is on the final verso (thus, on the back of pl. 26). The unusual format, with the recto of the first leaf (in effect, “page 1”) blank and the concluding “Chorus” not printed, might indicate that Blake intended to fill these absences with texts and/or designs, printed or in manuscript (a possibility suggested to me by Joseph Viscomi in correspondence). In comparison to <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> copy L (Essick collection), copy M has very narrow inner margins, with a distance between the two plates shown here of only about 1.5 cm. (8.5 cm. in copy L). Provenance: Acquired by John Linnell, probably directly from Blake or his widow; sold posthumously from the Linnell collection, Christie’s, 15 March 1918, #198 (£8.18s.6d. to the dealer Tregaskis acting for Frank Rinder); sold or given by Rinder to an unknown British collector; probably by inheritance to the vendor at Christie’s London, 26 Nov. 1997, #166 (£10,350 to John Windle acting for the Bentley collection, Toronto).

            <p>A Note on Linnell’s Job Advertisement. The copy of the Job “Proof” issue offered by the London dealer Simon Finch, as listed above, is said in Finch’s cat. 31 to include a manuscript “Advertisement” for the engravings written (but not signed) by John Linnell. According to the Finch cat., this Advertisement reads as follows: “Blake’s Illustrations of the Book of Job. Consisting of 22 Plates engraved by himself upon Copper from his own Designs. Price to subscribers [£]3.3[s.] Proof on India paper [£]5.5[s.] Subscriptions [£]1. received by the Author Wm. Blake. 3 Fountain Court, Strand or Mr. J. Linnell 6. Cirencester Place Fitzroy Square. These Plates are engraved entirely by Mr Blake with the graver only (that is without the aid of aqua fortis).” The final, important sentence about the method of executing the plates repeats a statement found in a “note” by Linnell among the Ivimy papers (see BR 234n1). My own study of the Job engravings over the last 32 years confirms Linnell’s claim, except that Blake used preliminary drypoint sketching in both the central and border designs of the Job engravings.</p>

But the painter's thoughts being always upon gold, he has introduced a character that Chaucer has not; namely a Goldsmith; for so the prospectus tells us. Why has he introduced a Goldsmith, and what is the wit of it, the prospectus does not explain. But it takes care to mention the reserve and modesty of the Painter; this makes a good epigram enough.

I can find no record of any other copy of <hi rend="i">A Descriptive Catalogue</hi> containing this revision. Other manuscript revisions by Blake in this copy include three diagonal pen-and-ink lines cancelling “and” between “Titian and Correggio” and between “Rafael and Albert Durer” on p. iv of the “Preface” (both are I believe unique revisions); and, on p. 64, the scratching-out in pen and ink of “of want,” with the addition of a caret with “want of” in pen and ink above the printed line before “idea,” so that the phrase reads “evidences the want of idea in the artist’s mind,” as similarly altered by Blake with pen and ink in copies B-D, F-H, J, L, and O.</figDesc>

He found the coloring opaque, crude in places, and unsympathetic to the underlying engraved image. In his opinion, the coloring is definitely not by Blake. Elizabeth B.

            <p>The date concluding this note looks suspiciously like “1849” at first glance. Such a date is disturbingly problematic, given the strong evidence that Cumberland died on 8 August 1848 (according to information supplied by G. E. Bentley, Jr., based on a printed obituary of Cumberland). However, as Kimberly Orlijan has pointed out to me, the concluding numeral looks like Cumberland’s “2,” as written elsewhere in the volume, but with only a slight suggestion of the horizontal base. Thus, my best guess is that the date is 1842.</p>

            <p>As to M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Blake’s works I do not think any person ever possessed a complete set - not even Blake himself[.] what has become of his plates I know not - as Mr<hi rend="s">s</hi>. Blake left all she had not sold to a person [Frederick Tatham] who has since then been a Bankrupt or something like it and I suppose has disposed of what he had -</p>
            <p>I have some of his best Drawings and the Job which I shall be happy to shew to your friends.</p>
            <p>I am D<hi rend="s">r</hi> Sir</p>
            <p>yours truly</p>
            <p>J. Linnell</p>
            <p>According to Alexander Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi> (London and Cambridge: Macmillan, 1863) 1: 126, “The gentleman [Tatham] from whom they [the 10 copperplates for <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> electrotyped by Gilchrist] were obtained had once the entire series in his possession; but all save these ten were stolen by an ungrateful black he had befriended, who sold them to a smith as old metal.” Tatham (1805-78) is very probably the source for this story of a theft that may have included many copperplates for the illuminated books besides those for the <hi rend="i">Songs.</hi> Linnell’s letter, quoted above, suggests that Tatham himself sold the plates for financial reasons. Linnell, however, did not think kindly of Tatham and, as this letter makes clear, only “suppose[s]” that Tatham sold the plates.</p>

            <p>Dear M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Cumberland [almost certainly George Cumberland,Jr.]</p>
            <p>As you were the first to introduce me to Blake you are entitled to any information respecting him, but all I have to say about him at present is that the Burlington Art Club are going to exhibit some of his works[.]</p>
            <p>I am very unwell just now though very thankful looking to the Author &amp; finisher of our Faith - not looking to clergy or prayer books made by them but the best prayer book - The Book of Psalms in Hebrew &amp; greek[.] Congletons translation I recommend to you because there is the proper <hi rend="i">Jehovah</hi> in its place &amp; not <hi rend="i">Lord</hi> instead which word <hi rend="i">Lord</hi> is also in its place &amp; so there is sense and not confusion. (James &amp; Hawkins 70 Welbeck S<hi rend="s">t</hi>. W. London</p>

Yale Center for British Art; accession no. B1997.14.6079. Not in Butlin. Recently attributed to Blake by Patrick Noon (supported by David Bindman) and identified by Noon as a preliminary sketch for the pencil, pen and water-color drawing of the same subject in the Philadelphia Museum of Art (Butlin #778). See Noon, <hi rend="i">The Human Form Divine: William Blake from the Paul Mellon Collection</hi>, exhibition catalogue (New Haven: Yale Center for British Art) 2, 82 (not reproduced). Acquired 1963 by Paul Mellon as part of the Thomas E. Lowinsky collection (whose collection mark appears near the lower left corner of the drawing); given by Mellon to the Yale Center for British Art in 1977. Although the treatment of the stomach muscles is unusual for Blake, the attribution seems convincing to me. In the more finished version of the design, the figure’s bat-like wings (only sketched in outline in the Yale drawing) extend above his arms and the twisted forms in his hands terminate, at their lower ends, in tridents (suggesting lightning bolts?).

This area on <hi rend="i">Thenot and Colinet</hi> contains fragments of a partly-erased inscription—almost certainly the single word “Colinet.” This inscription is in a brown ink clearly distinct from the black ink Blake used in the design. I suspect that this (title?) inscription was written by Blake at a time subsequent to the composition of the design or, more probably, by John Linnell when he first acquired the drawings. The similar area on the lower drawing illus. here shows only tiny fragments of an inscription which I cannot decipher. The reproductions of all the extant Virgil drawings in Butlin show similar abraded areas, all top center, on #769.3, 7, 9, and 11. Detailed inspection of the originals may reveal more about these previously-unnoticed inscriptions and their subsequent erasure, partial or complete.<lb/><lb/>
Proofs of the wood engraving of <hi rend="i">Thenot and Colinet</hi> pulled before the blocks were cut down for publication show slightlymore of the tree on the right. The fruits hanging from the tree along the left margin in the drawing are smaller and higher in the untrimmed wood engraving; the dog (lower right) can hardly be seen in the latter. There are no extant pre-publication proofs of the block bearing “<hi rend="i">For Him Our Yearly Wakes.</hi>” The published wood engraving does not show the tree on the right, but it may have been on the block before it was reduced. The neoclassical building in the background is larger and more prominent in the wood engraving, with its portico shifted to the right, behind the female harpist. For a general discussion of the role of the preliminary drawings in relation to the relief etching of four Virgil designs and to the later wood engravings, see Robert N. Essick, “A Relief Etching of Blake’s Virgil Illustrations,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 25 (1991-92): 117-27.

If such an apprehension did not operate, I should certainly scarcely think he merited notice in this letter. He has modestly asserted, I am told, that he paints for posterity. I sincerely hope he will afford them more gratification than he does his contemporaries. He has a great admirer and defender, I believe the only one, in a Mr. W. Blake, a miserable engraver, and one of the most eccentric men of the age. This man has hailed him as the modern Michael Angelo” (2:139).</p>

This vol. contains crude, unsigned and untitled wood engravings of Blake’s pls. 4 (“The Mecoo &amp; Kishee Kishee Monkeys,” reversed) and 5 (“The Skinning of the Aboma Snake, shot by Cap. Stedman”) first published in J. G. Stedman, <hi rend="i">Narrative, of a Five Years’ Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</hi> (1796). The wood engravings face pp. 162 and 166 in the 1824 vol. As the “Preface,” p. [5], in the <hi rend="i">Travels</hi> explains, its text, intended for “young Readers,” is based on “the most authentic and recent accounts of Travellers” to South America, but these have been transformed into a narrative about “a fictitious personage.” Accordingly, the facing page texts describe the monkeys and the snake as seen by a character named “Philips” rather than Stedman.</p>

Quaritch, Jan. private offer, 1st issue with “The Little Vagabond,” publisher’s cloth binding that varies from all other copies I have seen, the blind-stamped cartouche on both covers smaller and differently configured, “Blake’s Poems.” stamped in gilt on the spine rather than on the front cover, rebacked with the original spine retained, recto of front free endpaper signed by the editor, J. J. Garth Wilkinson, and dated 16 July 1839 (the week after the printed date of the Preface, p. xxi), with a further presentation inscription on the title page, “From J. J. G. &amp; E. A. Wilkinson as a token of affectionate remembrance to Miss Walsh, London, 1844,” extra-illus. with water colors of the title pages to <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> and <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi>, these illus. perhaps (but by no means certainly) by the William Muir circle of facsimilists (acquired by R.

              <head>10 “Lucifer and the Pope in Hell.”</head>
              <figDesc>Intaglio etching/engraving, c. 1794. Image 18.3 × 24.6 cm.; trimmed on the left and at the top to a plate-mark of 22 × 27.9 cm.; sheet 22.4 × 28 cm. Laid paper, chain-lines 2.8 cm. apart; no watermark. Inscribed on the right below the image in an early hand (but not Blake’s), “William Blake,” and below and a little to the right, “scarce.” Slight evidence of a pencil inscription below the center of the image that might be a preliminary version of an imprint (although no such imprint appears in the 2nd st.). A previously unrecorded 1st (proof) st. with considerable pencil additions almost certainly by Blake. One of three known impressions—two printed in intaglio (the impression reproduced here and a 2nd st. in the British Museum—see illus. 11) and one printed from the surface of the pl. in colors (Huntington Library and Art Gallery—see illus. 12). The pencil additions in the impression illustrated above (but probably not visible in this reproduction) include the following: extensive hatching, rising from left to right, across the upper-left quarter of the print; darkening of Lucifer’s left hand and the chain linking him to the Pope; extensive additions to the Pope’s gown where it falls over his right leg; fragments of whiting in the ground below the Pope’s right foot; slight evidence of whiting or chalk over the confused mass of figures and serpent-like forms right of the Pope. See illus. 11 for the major changes between sts. The comparison reveals that Blake did not add the crosshatching to the plate, suggested by the pencil work upper left in this impression, but that he did darken the Pope’s gown and the chain linking Lucifer and the Pope. Blake did not eliminate the areas touched by whiting and/or chalk in this impression, although he excluded the forms right of the Pope in the color-printed impression in the Huntington (illus. 12). This impression removed in late 1996 from an extra-illustrated copy of Alexander Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi>, 2 vols. (1863). This copy of Gilchrist was rebound, probably in the late nineteenth century, in full calf by Root and Son. The print was folded down the middle, pasted to a stub, and bound into the Gilchrist volumes, almost certainly in the late nineteenth century. The volumes were acquired many years ago by an American private collector. Now Essick collection (this print only).</figDesc>

The additions to the copperplate in this 2nd st. include further crosshatching on the Pope’s gown; extensive work on Lucifer’s face, including the addition of pupils to both eyes; darkening of the chain linking the two standing figures; additions of further hatching to the ground beneath all figures; additions of cross-hatching to the worm or snake binding the monarch lower left; many small additions to the faces of the crowned monarchs who rise the highest above the group on the left; darkening of the point of Lucifer’s spear; additional hatching on the Pope’s crown and right foot; darkening of the cloud right of Lucifer and the Pope; additional hatching to the lower reaches of the flames above the monarchs and their minions on the left.

The serpent forms, human head, and what may be a horse’s head visible in the intaglio impressions (illus. 10-11) were either not yet etched on the plate or are covered by the color printing right of the Pope. The obscuring effects of the color printing make the determination of the underlying intaglio st. very difficult to determine, but what little evidence I can perceive (e.g., a few touches of hatching among the figures lower left) suggests that this print may very well be in the newly-discovered 1st st. or some other st. earlier than the 2nd st. in the British Museum (illus. 11).

Flaxman’s designs are based on a description of a cup in the First Idyll of Theocritus; hence, these and earlier containers with the same basic design are called “Theocritus Cups.” The design shown here—a woman and her two suitors—was clearly influenced by the “Orpheus” relief in the Villa Albani, Rome (which Flaxman saw during his long visit to Italy, 1787-94). The other side of each cup shows a fisherman and a boy. For preliminary drawings of the woman and suitors, see Robert R. Wark, <hi rend="i">Drawings by John Flaxman in the Huntington Collection</hi> (San Marino: Huntington Library, 1970) 77-79 no. 59 and illus.

Decorative yet utilitarian objects of this sort indicate Flaxman’s involvement in the commercial arts. Or, perhaps more importantly, such works question the distinction between the “commercial” and “fine” arts (the latter category institutionalized by the Royal Academy). Situating Blake within a similar social and economic context can provide a salutary antidote to the excessive romanticizing of Blake’s life and works initiated by Alexander Gilchrist’s 1863 biography. The parade of Blake’s commercial failures—his print-publishing business in partnership with James Parker in the 1780s, the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> project of the 1790s, the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> illustrations early in the next century (perhaps a success for the publisher R. H. Cromek, but not for Blake), the 1809 exhibition of paintings, the attempt to produce relief etchings for Thornton’s school Virgil in 1821 (to reference only the best-documented examples)—may not be irrelevant to our understanding of Blake’s efforts as an original artist and poet.</figDesc></figure>

                <head>15 Henry Fuseli, <hi rend="i">Callipyga: Mrs. Fuseli, With her Skirts Lifting Standing Before a Dressing Table with Phallic Supports.</hi></head>
                <figDesc>Pen and brown ink on laid paper, 16 × 9.5 cm. Datable to the 1790s. The title derives from “Callipyges, a surname of Venus” (according to both <hi rend="i">Bell’s New Pantheon</hi>, 1790, and Lemprière, <hi rend="i">A Classical Dictionary</hi>, 1815). Hence, the English “callipygian,” having shapely buttocks. The Greek inscription, upper left, makes no sense, but the Christie’s auction cat. proposes a doubly-marketable innuendo of sado-masochism: “I suffer pain” and “I inflict pain.” The phallic supports for the dressing (or is it always an “undressing”?) table hardly require verbal reiteration; the phallic nature of Mrs. Fuseli’s fetishized coiffure is slightly less obvious (doubters should invert the illustration). Notice the repetition of the same spreading and vulnerable form in the drapery above the woman, in the position of her arms, and in the skirt framing her lower body. Among the more intriguing motifs in this sketch is the circular form, almost like a compass-rose, centered on the woman’s feet and directing toward her even the attention of a modestly-lowered male gaze. Rather than the usual numbers around the circumference of a compass, Fuseli substitutes alternating penile and vaginal/anal forms. The radiant lines of this instrument for sexual navigation direct us both to Fuseli’s personal fascination with his wife’s formidable attractions and to something more mythic—the depersonalized, faceless body as the geographic center of masculine desire, both (latently) homosexual and (more acceptably to the artist and his age) heterosexual. Are the arms and hands (forming another sort of “compass”?) of this powerful female poised in command over male arousal, or are they submissively restrained in such a way as to make her available to both exposure and coital/colonial exploration? We may be observing here Fuseli’s equivalent of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Newton</hi> color print, with its geometry of masculinist hegemony over nature, and of Oothoon and her “soft American plains” (<hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>, E 46). Further, is this drawing a precursor of Blake’s frontispiece to <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, with its male traveller opening a passageway into the abyss? Fuseli’s touchingly matrimonial but blatantly physical eroticism and Blake’s eroticized spiritualism may share some of the same psychic landscape. Photo courtesy of Sotheby’s London.</figDesc>

                <figDesc>Mixed media on panel, 22.5 × 27.5 cm., c. 1835? If indeed by Palmer, this work probably dates from his “Devon” period immediately following the more famous “Shoreham” period. The three auctions in which this problematic work has appeared trace a history of uncertain attribution. Sotheby’s London first offered the painting on 19 April 1961, #89, “The Property of Ellis Tracey.” The catalogue dates the work to “circa 1825” and states that it was accompanied by a letter from A. H. Palmer, Samuel Palmer’s son, dated 25 March 1889. R. J. Hewitt purchased the painting for £5,200. He was very probably the vendor at the Sotheby’s auction on 15 July 1964, #58 (£4800 to Agnew’s, the London dealer). In both these auctions, the artist’s name was given in full without the “attributed to” designation—a traditional auctioneer’s code for a doubtful attribution—printed in Sotheby’s more circumspect catalogue of 9 April 1997, #81. The 1964 catalogue makes no reference to the A. H. Palmer letter; the 1997 catalogue mentions its presence in the 1961 sale but gives no further details. In the absence of the letter from Palmer’s son, or any record of what the document might have said about this painting, suspicions about its authenticity have grown, perhaps because of the lurid coloring in the sky and the awkward treatment of the mountain. The surface of the paint, particularly in the foreground, is cracked. My own opinion, based on an examination of the painting while at Sotheby’s in March 1997 and a comparison with the work reproduced here as illus. 17, is that this is almost certainly a genuine work by Samuel Palmer, although hardly representative of his finest efforts as an artist which, at their best, epitomize the intense, the severe, and the rustic-antique. Even a man granted by a small band of his cultural progeny the retrospective curse of being a mad/inspired/romantic genius can have an off day. See also illus. 17 and the caption thereto.

                <figDesc>Oil and tempera on panel, 26.5 × 38 cm., datable to 1835. The foreground details indicate Palmer’s continued “visionary” qualities, transported from his Shoreham period into his response to the landscape of Devon in the mid-1830s. The background mountain and intensely-colored sky are very similar to the work reproduced here as illus. 16. These shared characteristics help us attribute illus. 16 to Palmer with more confidence than we would otherwise have. It is an accidental but most welcome boon to old-fashioned scholars, still fixated on aesthetic quality and attribution, when two complementary works appear for inspection in the auction market in the same year.

            <p>In “Blake in the Marketplace, 1994,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 28 (1995):12-21 (captions to illus. 1-2), I claimed that the recto/verso impressions of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pls. 11 and 17 in my collection were from copy c of that illuminated book.

Unfortunately, the provenance of this leaf cannot be traced prior to 1964. I am grateful to my friend and fellow seeker of minute particulars, Jerry Bentley, for this correction.</p>

            <p>Pp. 41-43, “Lucifer and the Pope in Hell.” For the discovery of a previously-unknown first state, see illus. 10-12 and their captions. This discovery means that impression 1A (intaglio, British Museum) should be changed to 2A (indicating its status as a second state). I previously speculated that color-printed impression 1B (Huntington Library) was trimmed on a plate-mark of 19.9 × 27.4 cm.; the discovery of the new impression (which should be designated 1A) reveals that the plate-mark is very probably 22 × 27.9 cm. The underlying intaglio state of color-printed impression 1B is difficult to determine, but it may be in the newly-discovered first state or in some other state earlier than the second (British Museum).</p>
            <p>P. 145, “Venus Dissuades Adonis from Hunting,” after Cosway, 1787. During the writing of the catalogue, I was unable to locate an impression of the first state that included the imprint. An impression with the imprint was sold at Sotheby’s London, 13 Nov. 1997, lot 704, illus. This impression, now in the stock of the print dealer Nicholas Lott, confirms the first-state signatures, title, inscribed verses, and imprint (the last quoted from Keynes, <hi rend="i">Engravings by Blake: The Separate Plates</hi> 69) recorded in the catalogue.</p>

            <p>Pp. 38-39, <hi rend="i">The Wit’s Magazine</hi>, pl. 5, “May-Day in London.” The preliminary drawing by Samuel Collings is reported as being in the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, “although the curator has not yet been able to track it down” (<hi rend="i">Separate Plates</hi> 39). The drawing has apparently been found; at the very least, it is reproduced in Marcia Pointon, “Quakerism and Visual Culture 1650-1800,” <hi rend="i">Art History</hi> 20 (1997): 425, pl. 48 (pen and gray wash, no size given). I am grateful to John E. Grant for pointing out this reproduction to me.</p>
            <p>Pp. 61-64, Gay, <hi rend="i">Fables</hi> (1793). In my descriptions of each of Blake’s 12 plates, I compare his renditions of the designs by William Kent, John Wootton, and Henry Gravelot to those engraved by various hands and printed in the first eds. of the first (1727) and second (1738) series of fables. The first-series pls. of 1727 have a horizontal major axis; those for the second series of 1738 have a vertical major axis. Following Geoffrey Keynes, “Blake’s Engravings for Gay’s Fables,” <hi rend="i">The Book Collector</hi> 21 (1972): 59-64, I indicate that these sets of plates served as the models for Blake’s. But this may be an invalid assumption. For the fifth ed. of the first series of <hi rend="i">Fables</hi> (London: J. and R. Tonson and J. Watts, 1737), all the original designs were re-engraved by Gerard Van Der Gucht (c. 1695-1776, not to be confused with his brother John, 1697-1776, who engraved pls. for the first eds.). In the 1757 ed. of both series (London: C. Hitch and L. Hawes, et al.), the G. Van Der Gucht pls. for the first series are repeated, with new plates signed by the same engraver now appearing in the second series as well. These re-engravings for both series may have served as Blake’s models. This possibility is increased by the fact that G. Van Der Gucht’s pls. illustrating Fables I, XII, and XVI in the second series reverse right and left, in comparison to the pls. for these fables in the 1738 ed., and alter the format of the original 1738 pls. to a horizontal major axis. These same changes in both direction and axis appear in the 3 corresponding pls. that Blake engraved for the second series (pls. 10-12 in Bentley). The 1762 and 1767 eds. of both series contain unsigned re-engravings of the original designs. Because of their vertical format, it is improbable that Blake used this later set of pls. as his model.</p>
            <p>Pp. 89-90, Hayley, <hi rend="i">Life of Cowper</hi>, pl. 6, “A Sketch of the Monument Erected . . . In Memory of William Cowper Esq,” Blake after Flaxman. In addition to the record of Flaxman’s later delivery of preliminary drawings for this pl. to Hayley, the sculptor apparently sent his first recorded drawing of the monument with a letter of 18 Feb. 1802—see Sotheby, Wilkinson &amp; Hodge, 2 March 1885 auction cat., letters from the collection of the Rev. Canon Hodgson, lot 63 (Flaxman “sends him [Hayley] designs for Cowper’s monument” according to the auction cat., original letter untraced). This is probably the same drawing which Hayley in turn sent to Lady Hesketh on 21 Feb. 1802 (now Houghton Library, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts).</p>

It includes Thomas Butts, Thomas Hartley Cromek, George Cumberland, John Flaxman and his family, Henry Fuseli, Thomas and William Hayley, John Linnell and his family, Samuel Palmer, James Parker, George Richmond, Thomas Stothard, and John Varley. It does <hi rend="i">not</hi> include important contemporaries with whom Blake’s contact was negligible or non-existent such as John Constable and William Wordsworth and Edmund Burke; such major figures are dealt with more comprehensively elsewhere, and the light they throw upon Blake is very dim.</p>

                <figDesc>Pl. 25, 1. 6 reads “And weep and bow thy reverend locks!” while all other copies save L read merely “And weep.” Note that pl. 25-26 face each other across the fold of a single piece of paper.<lb/><lb/>
The inking of some letters in pl. 25 is quite distinctly darker than others, particularly in an almost-vertical line about an inch in from the left margin: “coast,” “meadows,” “of,” “and the,” “France.”<lb/><lb/>
In the title and the first line (the bottom of the letter “g,” the top of “f,” “iberty” and all the next line, “The . . . Earth”) but on no other letters on pl. 25-27, the outside of the letter prints nicely and darkly but the center is white, as if it were recessed and did not take the ink. This is not visible in copies H-I but partially visible in copies B, D-E. By comparison, on pl. 27, 1. 20, the last words, “Empire is no more! and now the lion &amp; wolf shall cease” are in larger letters than the rest but they are not hollow like the first ones on pl. 25.<lb/><lb/>
According to Joseph Viscomi (see above), <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> pl. 25 was cut from the top left corner of a copperplate, pl. 26 from the top right corner of a copperplate, and pl. 27 (upside down) was from the top right corner of a copperplate. However, the platemarks indented on these prints in copy M are sharp, though one might have expected to find rounded corners on the uncut plate.</figDesc>

                <title>Introduction</title>
              </head>
              <p>Blake Discoveries in 1997</p>
              <p>Two exciting new texts by “William Blake” were first described in 1997: a previously unknown letter to George Cumberland of 1 September 1800 and the Sophocles Manuscript.</p>
              <p>The Blake letter is not yet published, but a transcription is promised soon by Morton Paley and Robert N. Essick, the new owner and the most redoubtable scholar-collector of Blake since the death in 1982 of Sir Geoffrey Keynes. It is especially surprising that a letter to Cumberland should appear at this late date, almost 200 years after it was written, for most of Cumberland’s letters went in 1849 to the British Museum (now the British Library). Perhaps Cumberland tucked this letter into his copy of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> (F), until it was sold in 1857. The contents of the new letter are very surprising.</p>
              <p>The Sophocles Manuscript, still in private hands, has been seen by very few Blake scholars. The only two who have analyzed it in print came to diametrically opposite conclusions as to its connection with the poet William Blake. Michael Phillips believes that the “William Blake” signatures scattered throughout the manuscript were written by the poet-artist William Blake, that he may have owned it
<pb id="p31-140" n="140"/>
from 1772 through 1812, and that perhaps he wrote the translation of Sophocles’ <hi rend="i">Ajax</hi> and the learned commentary on it. If Michael Phillips is correct, we must rethink carefully and extensively the implications of the knowledge of Greek and Latin and the absorption in the classics which the Sophocles Manuscript implies in Blake.</p>
              <p>If, on the other hand, G.E. Bentley, Jr., is right in concluding that none of the three or four hands in the Sophocles Manuscript is that of the poet-artist, we may learn from it more about one of the poet’s many contemporary namesakes, but it will tell us nothing of the author of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> and <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of Job.</hi></p>
              <p>Copies of several long-lost works by Blake have suddenly reappeared. <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pl. 1 (“The Ancient of Days”), last traced in the G. C. Smith sale in 1938 (<hi rend="i">BB</hi> 340), has turned up in a private New York collection, and another copy, long believed to have been printed posthumously, has been shown by its new owner, Robert N. Essick, to be from the 1794 printing.</p>
              <p><hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> (M), consisting of pl. 25-27, first and last recorded in the 1918 Linnell sale, was apparently acquired then by Frank Rinder. Copy M was lost to sight in the Rinder family, perhaps because it was tucked into a copy of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of Job.</hi> The <hi rend="i">Job</hi> was included in a lot of furniture brought in to be sold at Christie’s, discovered there by John Windle in June 1997, and sold at Christie’s in November.</p>
              <p>Comparison of copy M with the same plates of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (L), now owned by Robert N. Essick, indicates that they were probably printed at the same time in the same dark grey or very dark brown ink and with the same variant on pl. 25 found in no other copy and not previously associated with copy M. More important, copy M has no inked text at the bottom of pl. 27 where other copies have the eight-line Chorus of “A Song of Liberty.” However, the uninked, indented fragments of the text of the Chorus seem to be visible where the Chorus should be (see illus. 1-3). No very plausible motive for Blake to omit the Chorus has yet occurred to GEB or his numerous perplexed advisers. Surely Blake had not decided he was wrong to say that “every thing that lives is Holy” or that it was indiscrete or indelicate to write of “pale religious letchery.” As is usual with Blake discoveries, the new copy of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> raises more fascinating new problems than it solves.</p>
              <p>The most exciting newly found copy of a known work by Blake is <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> (U), which had been bought by George Cumberland Jr., in November 1809, sent to his father, and lost to sight for 188 years. It was brought in off the street to Marlborough Rare Books in London in the summer of 1997 and rapidly moved to the collection of Robert N. Essick. Copy U is enriched with corrections by Blake, two of them not previously known, plus letters and descriptions by John Linnell and George Cumberland about Blake.</p>
              <p>While some important and unique Blake originals have been found, others have been lost. The letter from Blake of 11 December 1805 and the letter to Blake of 17 April 1800 are in some untraced limbo between the Keynes Family Trust and the Fitzwilliam Museum and Cambridge University Library to which the other Blakes from the Keynes Collection went at the death of Sir Geoffrey, and none of the interested parties can say what has become of them.</p>
              <p>A surprising number of newly recorded printings of Blake’s poems between his death in 1827 and Gilchrist’s biography in 1863 have been found, some 30 in all. They are in locations as obscure as the <hi rend="i">National Anti-Slavery Standard</hi> (1842-49)<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> and as obvious as William Hone’s <hi rend="i">EveryDay Book</hi> (1827-89). Blake was a good deal more accessible in odd snippets than we have hitherto known. <note id="n7"><hi rend="s">7</hi> See Andrew M. Stauffer, “The First Known Publication of Blake’s Poetry in America,” <hi rend="i">N&amp;Q</hi> 241 [N.S. 43] (1996): 42-43.</note></p>

              <p>A major Blake exhibition was held at the Yale Center for British Art which silently celebrates the transfer of the last of Paul Mellon’s Blakes to the Center. In the long run, such exhibitions have major effects upon the understanding and appreciation of Blake among students and scholars and reflective lovers of the arts; in the short term, they are the occasion for conclusions such as that in the <hi rend="i">Wall Street Journal</hi> (23 April 1997) that Blake’s “etchings grow hairier and hotter over time.”</p>
              <p>Blake’s works are very rapidly becoming better known in Spain, most particularly in 1996-97 through the work of the Fundación “la Caixa,” which sponsored a major exhibition with catalogues in Spanish (Madrid) and Catalan (Barcelona). At last count, these exhibitions had stimulated 100 reviews, notices, announcements, and puffs.</p>

              <p>The volume of publications concerning William Blake, his art and his poetry, seems to continue unabated. This 1997 checklist records 11 books about Blake, 15 editions, 10 catalogues, 155 articles and parts of books, 20 dissertations (mostly doctoral theses), and 194 reviews. In addition to those published in English in Australia, Britain, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, and the U.S.A., there were a substantial number of publications in less familiar scripts, including Braile (1), Chinese (2), Danish (1), French (6), German (12), Italian (4), Japanese (8), and Spanish and Catalan (109).</p>

<pb id="p31-141" n="141"/>
of Virginia, both of which are still maturing and each of which offers means of access to Blake’s works which would be much more cumbersome using hard copies. <note id="n8"><hi rend="s">8</hi> http://www.english.uga.edu/Blake_Concordance</note><note id="n9"><hi rend="s">9</hi> http:/jefferson.village.virginia.edu/blake; see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> (1997).</note></p>
              <p>The most basic work in cumulating new Blake information is of course provided in Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace” and in “William Blake and His Circle” in <hi rend="i">Blake.</hi></p>
              <p>A good deal of light has been thrown on Blake’s life by Lane Robson and Joseph Viscomi in their revelation that the fumes from copper bathed in acid as in the etching process are toxic, that Blake’s process of relief etching required much longer etching than most etchers used, and that indeed Blake may have died from biliary cirrhosis of the liver caused by chronic copper intoxication.<ref target="n10" type="note">10</ref> The newly discovered hazard of his profession is likely to shock most of us. But as Blake lived to be almost 70, a very respectable age in the 1820s, we may wonder how much sclerosing cholangitis shortened or indeed affected his life. <note id="n10"><hi rend="s">10</hi> Lane Robson &amp; Joseph Viscomi, “Blake’s Death,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 29 (1996): 36-49.</note></p>
              <p>More oblique light is thrown on Blake by the account of the sudden and quite unexpected death in 1805 of James Parker,<ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref> Blake’s fellow apprentice (1773-79), his housemate and partner in a print-shop (1784-85), and his lifelong friend. It would be surprising if Blake had not been intimately familiar with the details of his old friend’s abrupt death and of his irregular will. <note id="n11"><hi rend="s">11</hi> “The Death of Blake’s Partner James Parker,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 29 (1996): 49-51.</note></p>
              <p>The books on Blake recorded here range from Peter Davies’ modest little student primer called <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi> (1996)<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> to the collection of essays on <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> called <hi rend="i">Speak Silence</hi>, ed. Mark Greenberg (1996), and three books which apparently grew out of dissertations.<ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref> Helen Bruder, <hi rend="i">William Blake and the Daughters of Albion</hi> (1997) is a fervently partisan feminist exercise which laments that “Blake often let women and their rights slip from his work” (32) and that Blake studies seems to be afflicted by “patrician disinterest” in feminism (32, 182). Her very extensive research has produced a mass of fascinating information about attitudes to women in Blake’s time. Some of her arguments and conclusions may afflict or astonish readers, but the extent and thoroughness of her research must compel admiration. <note id="n12"><hi rend="s">12</hi> Davies has apparently not attempted “the colossal effort required to elucidate” “the prophetic books” (62), which does not leave a great deal of Blake’s poetry beyond <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi>, the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, and unpublished lyrics.</note><note id="n13"><hi rend="s">13</hi> I ignore here Marcia Baker, <hi rend="i">If You Only Imagine:</hi> The Wondrous World of William Blake (1996), Marianne Bresson, <hi rend="i">William Blake:</hi> som teologisk udfordrin (1993), Christian Frommert, <hi rend="i">Heros und Apokalypse:</hi> Zum Erhabenen in Werken Johann Heinrich Fuesslis und William Blakes (1996), and <hi rend="i">William Blake:</hi> des Chants d’innocence au Livre d’Urizen, ed. Christian La Cassagnère (1996), because I have been unable to see them.</note></p>
              <p>Kathryn Freeman’s <hi rend="i">Blake’s Nostos:</hi> Fragmentation and Nondualism in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> (1997), is part of a series on Western Esoteric Traditions, but it is chiefly concerned with Blake’s myth rather than with Western Esoteric Traditions. Her conclusion that “Blake emblematizes the epic nostos, the homecoming as a return to wholeness” (159) does not seem to require an esoteric tradition to justify it.</p>
              <p>William Richey, <hi rend="i">Blake’s Altering Aesthetic</hi> (1997), argues that we have uncritically accepted the conclusions that Blake’s early work is gothic and his late work anti-classical. A good deal of evidence supports the contrary—or at least an ambivalent—conclusion about Blake’s attitude to gothic and classical ideals. The connection of evidence and conclusion in the book is sometimes curiously unpersuasive, but the argument was worth making.</p>
              <p>Two of the most impressive essays on Blake’s writings in the past year are by Joseph Viscomi and Hisao Ishizuka. In “The Evolution of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>,” <hi rend="i">Huntington Library Quarterly</hi> 58 (1996): 281-44, Viscomi makes a customarily detailed and powerful argument that the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> evolved through distinct sequential stages of composition, that some of the parts may have been conceived and even intended for publication separately, and that the whole was imagined and completed in 1790, not in ?1790-?1793 as in previous conventional wisdom. All future accounts of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> must take serious account of Viscomi’s argument—an argument which is not yet completed, for he promises sequels to this essay.</p>
              <p>The most original and persuasive of the hundreds of Japanese articles and books I have seen over many years is Hisao Ishizuka’s “Thel’s ‘Complaint’: A Medical Reading of Blake’s <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi>,” <hi rend="i">Eibungaku Kenkyu Nihon Eibungakkai: Studies in English Literature, The English Literary Society of Japan</hi> 73 (1997): 245-63. He argues, with abundant and persuasive detail from <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> and from eighteenth-century medical and conduct books, that Thel recognizably suffers from green-sickness fostered by the unnatural cultural imperatives of sexual modesty and repression for adolescent girls. Her flight, shrieking, from the Vales of Har “is, therefore, not a commendable resistance to ideology; rather, it is a literal and imbecile enactment of the cultural imperative” (262).</p>
              <p>The essays of Viscomi and Ishizuka take us far from the paths of conventional wisdom—and they persuade me that these are the paths we shall have to follow in future to reach a recognizably Blakean destination.</p>

              <p>Other essays beckon us down byways which seem singularly unpromising.

              <p>My favorite argument is that of Elizabeth O’Higgins, who discerns on the head of the child in Blake’s design of “The Death of Earl Goodwin” the letters “CCeil.” This proves to her satisfaction that “The child’s name is O’Neill,” and this in turn “establishes the meaning of the picture”<ref target="n19" type="note">19</ref>—at least it may do so if one believes, as she does, that Blake’s father was named O’Neill. For those who persist in thinking that the grandfather and father of “English Blake” were named James Blake,<ref target="n20" type="note">20</ref> the significance of CCeil is not so transparent. <note id="n19"><hi rend="s">19</hi> Elizabeth O’Higgins, “The Wild Deer: Introduction to William Blake’s Hidden Designs,” <hi rend="i">Dublin Magazine</hi>, N.S. 30 [i.e., 29] (Jan-March 1954) [N.Y.: Kraus Reprint Corporation, 1967]:9.</note><note id="n20"><hi rend="s">20</hi> Blake’s father’s name is given in the poet’s baptismal register, and his grandfather’s name is given in his father’s apprenticeship indenture (<hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> [1969] 51).</note></p>
              <p>But one should be grateful for the invitation to follow such byways. And perhaps, when we know more or are wiser, they will seem as promising as those of Joseph Viscomi and Hisao Ishizuka.</p>

                  <p>Patrons of Blake’s exhibition who did not buy the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> itself were offered “<hi rend="i">an index to the Catalogue gratis.</hi>” No separate copy of this Index has been traced, but presumably it is identical with the “Index” to the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> itself (Signature G6).</p>
                  <p>Copies of the Index for separate distribution could have been created by printing extra copies of Sheet G from which leaf G6 with the Index could be cut. However, it is much more likely that the Index leaves were amputated from whole copies of the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> in order to have them to sell to non-catalogue-buying patrons of the exhibition. The amputation method would have left some copies of the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> lacking the Index leaf.</p>
                  <p>Confirmation of this speculation is found in <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> copy U, which was bought in November 1809 for George Cumberland by his son, who had already seen the exhibition and the catalogue, and which lacks the Index leaf (G6). If other copies of the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> appear without the Index leaf, we may presume that they were bought at 28 Broad Street by individuals who did not propose to see the exhibition; untraced copy V, which was bought in November 1809 by George Cumberland Jr., for Barry’s library in Bristol, should lack the Index.</p>

                    <figDesc>The “Chorus” at the bottom of the page has not printed, but the tops of the first two letters of “Chorus” and the flourishes above it are plain, and the rest of the word “Chorus” and fragments of the text below it are faintly embossed on the paper. In <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (K), pl. 24 lacks the design of Nebuchadnezzar at the bottom; however, there is no embossing of the design, and a faint indentation just below the text seems to indicate that the bottom of pl. 24 was masked when it was printed, as I am informed by David Scrase of the Fitzwilliam Museum.<lb/><lb/>
Some of the etched lines seem to touch the outer margin—pl. 25, “-merican,” “the ocean,” “Rome,” “-derous” on the left and “across,” “dungeon;,” and “thun-” on the right; pl. 26, “hoary,” “vain,” “chariots,” “slings,” “wilderness” on the right —apparently leaving no room at all for the wax dike which Blake is believed to have used to keep in the acid when the plate was being etched. (The evidence of this dike is quite plain in the irregular black borders of posthumous copies, e.g., of <hi rend="i">America, Europe, Jerusalem</hi>, and the <hi rend="i">Songs.</hi>) I cannot account for this.<lb/><lb/>
In the context of the debate about the use of Blake’s variable formation of the letter “g” for dating purposes (see D. V. Erdman, “Dating Blake’s Script; the ‘g’ hypothesis,” his “postscript” to this note; GEB, “Blake’s Sinister ‘g,’ from 1789-93 to ?1803,” <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi> 3 [1969]: 8-13, 42, 43-45; and Robert N. Essick, “‘The Phoenix’: A Problem in Attribution,” <hi rend="i">Philological Quarterly</hi> 67 [1988]: 371) notice that the serif on the letter “g” is more often than not on the left, but there is a quite differently formed “g,” with a right-ward serif, much more like ordinary hand-writing than Blake’s usual Illuminated Book print-writing.<lb/><lb/>
left-serif “g”: pl. 25 Song groand falling trembling light king grey wings among flaming; pl. 26 night falling enlarge counting winged thoughts flaming sinking roaring beating wings king grey among falling rushing ruining night emerge gloomy king leading; pl. 27 glancing morning golden spurning loosing night crying [In the “Chorus” not printed here: longer virginity thing]<lb/><lb/>

                    <head>3 <hi rend="i">Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> (L) (Robert N. Essick) pl. 27.<gap type="emend"/></head>
                    <figDesc>Notice the ink <corr type="emend">splatter</corr> in ll. 5-6, the broken tail of the semi-colon after “free,” the smudges after “his” in the first line and especially at the bottom right of the page, about “wishes,” “every,” and “Holy,” and the “a” of “calls.” The paper size, wide margins, and registration are handsome in copy L, but the inking is more careful and the impression sharper in copy M.<lb/><lb/>
The chief difference between the impressions of pl. 27 in copies L and M is the presence of the “Chorus” in copy L and its ommission in copy M. However, the ghost of the Chorus is perceptible even in copy M. Not only is the top of the “C” of “Chorus” clearly visible, but the bottom of the “C” and indeed the rest of the “horus” are discernible in an un-inked, blind impression even in the photograph (and, I hope, in the printed reproduction).<lb/><lb/>
An indentation farther down the page of copy M seem to show the vertical risers of “deadly black” in exactly the position they occupy in copy M. Under the hind hooves of the left ramping horse, the “L” of “Let” may be made out, and other surface noice reveals isolated letters to the eye of faith. At least, all those whom GEB has invited to examine the print have begun in healthy skepticism bordering upon incredulity and ended with growing faith that the fragments of the text of the “Chorus” may be discerned embossed in the un-inked bottom of <hi rend="i">Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> (M) pl. 27.<lb/><lb/>
Very few observers profess to make out whole letters in copy M pl. 27, much less whole words (except for “Chorus” and “Let”), and therefore it is not possible to determine whether the blind text copy of M was identical with the inked text of copy L and other copies.</figDesc>

Bold-face indicates plates upside-down; “x” and apparently “—” identify unknown plates.</p>
                  <p>Sheet II was originally used for “The Approach of Doom,” and <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> pl. 4 came from the sheet from which <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> was cut (see above).</p>
                  <p>Plates 16, 19</p>
                  <p>According to Viscomi, <hi rend="i">ut supra</hi>, 313n38, <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> pl. 19 (10.2 × 16.4 cm.) was “likely paired with [<hi rend="i">i.e., etched on the verso of</hi>] <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> pl. 21 [<hi rend="i">10.2 × 16.6</hi>]” rather than <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> pl. 16 (10.2 × 16.6 cm.), as in <hi rend="i">BB</hi> 167.</p>
                  <p>Plate 21</p>
                  <p>According to Viscomi, <hi rend="i">ut supra</hi>, it is <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> pl. 21 (10.2 × 16.6) which is probably on the verso of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> pl. 19 (10.2 × 16.4) rather than <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> pl. 16 (10.2 × 16.6 cm.), as in <hi rend="i">BB</hi> 167.<ref target="n35" type="note">35</ref><note id="n35"><hi rend="s">35</hi> The dimensions of plates in the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> given in Viscomi differ slightly from those in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> partly because he gives four dimensions (height on left and right sides, width at top and bottom) rather than two (width at bottom and height at right) and partly because he gives individual measurements for five copies, whereas <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> gives average measurements for each plate in all copies. The differences are not, however, substantial.</note></p>
                  <p>Variants:</p>
                  <p>Pl. 26, l. 6: Copy M reads “And weep and bow thy reverend locks!” as in Copy L, rather than “And weep!” as in other copies. In Copy M, there is a pencil “x” beside the line (see illus. 1).</p>
                  <p>N.b. When these letters were etched out, they were not replaced with flourishes to fill in the empty space, though every other such space on the plate is so filled. The erasure had to be done extremely carefully, for, in the erased “thy” (l. 6), the riser of “h” is on the same level as the flourishing descender of the “y” in “eternity” above it (l. 5), the ornamental descender of the “y” in the same “thy” actually touches the riser in the “h” in “hands” below it (l. 7), and the riser of the “k” of “locks” (l. 6) overlaps the descender of the “g” of “falling” (l. 7)—and the overlap is still visible on copies such as B where the end of l. 6 is erased.</p>
                  <p>Pl. 27: The 8-line Chorus is not inked in Copy M (see illus. 2). However, the tops of the first two letters of “Chorus” and of the flourishes round it are inked. The obscuring was probably not achieved by masking (by laying a piece of paper between the bottom of the plate and the paper-to-be-printed-on), for there is no indentation from this masking-leaf, and the portions omitted are not in a straight line—the missing word “Chorus” is between the unobscured rearing horses.</p>
                  <p>Further, the flourish below the word “Chorus” is visible in indentation. Even more strikingly, in sharply-raking light faint hints of the rest of the text of the “Chorus” are also discernable; the “L” of “Let” in the first line, the “dl” of “deadly” in the second line and the exclamation-point after “not” in the seventh line are particularly clear.</p>
                  <p>If these ghost-letters are truly there, this means that (1) The plate was not masked, for this embossing would scarcely show through a layer of paper; (2) The letters are not black either because (a) they were never inked or (b) the ink was wiped off or (c), probably, a combination of the two, as must be the case with the “C” of “Chorus,” which is inked at the top and only embossed at the bottom; (3) The text was complete when the print was inked; it is not merely waiting for a design or inspiration to fill the space.</p>
                  <p>But of course we must be very cautious about determining just what was written in this early version of the “Chorus.” All this evidence shows clearly is that “deadly” (or at least “dl”) and “not!” (or at least “!”) were present when pl. 27 of Copy M was printed.</p>
                  <p>Copy M</p>
                  <p>Binding: Three plates are printed on two integral leaves (one folded half-sheet); the page left blank is, very oddly, the first one (see illus. 1-2). The first (blank) page is perhaps slightly dirtier than others, and it seems slightly foxed.</p>
                  <p>Paper size: The paper is somewhat irregular in shape, 24.3 cm. wide (measured at the bottom) or 23.8 cm. (at top) × 20.0 cm. high (at right of inner folding) or 19.6 cm. (at left). The original deckled edges are still on the right (when looking at pl. 25-26) and top; the bottom and left edges are slightly crooked as if cut with scissors (a knife would surely have been drawn along a straight edge, as of a ruler). The paper was folded not quite in the middle—who is to say
<pb id="p31-147" n="147"/>
when and by whom it was folded? The crease is now very firm, and there is a tiny tear at bottom of the crease. The leaf with pl. 25 is 11.7 cm. wide at the top, and that with pl. 26-27 is 12.1 cm. wide at top.</p>
                  <p>Registration: Pl. 25-26 are carefully registered top and bottom—the plate-marks are very clear. Pl. 27 is pretty carefully registered with pl. 26—it is very slightly higher. Copies K (pl. 21-24), L (pl. 25-27), and M (pl. 25-27) were almost certainly not produced together, for the paper sizes are quite different.</p>

                  <p>The Sophocles Manuscript</p>
                  <p>Binding: Bound in pale reddish marbled boards over a parchment spine; by December 1995 the parchment spine had mostly perished, but the leaves were still secure. John Byrne, who examined the manuscript in 1993, tells me that it was inscribed on the spine with the name of “BLUNDEN,” but this has now disappeared. Many leaves were torn out close to the gutter, generally one at a time but at least once (between ff. 51-52) in a group of up to half a dozen, leaving very narrow stubs.<ref target="n42" type="note">42</ref><note id="n42"><hi rend="s">42</hi> F. 121 is now free, leaving no stub, raising the possibility that other now untraceable leaves may also have been removed without leaving a stub or other trace.</note></p>

                  <p>Description: It is a small quarto volume (16.0 × 21.0 cm.) presently consisting of 191 leaves (all but the first and last fly-leaves—on laid paper with vertical chain lines —foliated 1-189 in 1993 by John Byrne then of Bertram Rota) of laid paper with horizontal chain-lines (as in a quarto) bearing at the center of the inner margins a watermark of Britannia and a crown of a type common before 1794 and a countermark of GR above a tiny cross.<ref target="n46" type="note">46</ref><note id="n46"><hi rend="s">46</hi> W. A. Churchill, <hi rend="i">Watermarks in Paper in Holland, England, France etc., in the XVII and XVIII Centuries and their Interconnection</hi> (Amsterdam: Menno Herzberger &amp; Co., 1935), #219-38, show Britannia with a staff in her hand and a shield behind her, within an oval beneath a crown, some of them (e.g., #221) with GR, but all are pretty distinct from that in the Sophocles MS (a reproduction of which was generously provided to GEB by Anthony Rota). Edward Heawood, <hi rend="i">Watermarks in Paper Mainly of the 17 <hi rend="s">th</hi> and 18<hi rend="s">th</hi> Centuries</hi> (Hilversum, Holland: The Paper Publications Society, 1950: Monumenta Chartae Papyraceae Historiam Illustrantia, I), #201-20, show a similar Britannia, and #207-10, 214-21 have a GR attached, #208 (n.d.), 217 (1794), and 218 (1790) being most like the Sophocles MS. The GR watermark is more common, with 24 examples in Heawood, none just like those in the Sophocles Manuscript.
                                            <p>The Britannia watermark (only half visible at a time) is on ff. 1-39, 106-39, 141-44, 146-49, 170-71, 174-75; and GR (half at a time) is on the rest. Normally a watermark appears on only half the leaves of a divided sheet of paper, not on each leaf, as in the Sophocles MS, but, according to Heawood, such double marks (two on the same sheet) were not uncommon.</p><p>A similar but distinct Britannia watermark with a crowned G R countermark is reproduced in <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi>, ed. G.E. Bentley, Jr (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1969) 53, and a fleur de lis watermark above a rectangular shield with a GR countermark is in <hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon</hi> (<hi rend="i">BB</hi> [1977], 221).</p></note></p>
                  <p>These quarto leaves were bound with a printed octavo<ref target="n47" type="note">47</ref> volume bearing the Greek text of Sophocles,<ref target="n48" type="note">48</ref> which have offset very faintly onto facing pages showing two columns of footnotes separated by a vertical rule. On many leaves one or more eighteenth-century hands wrote in old brown ink a translation (into very colloquial eighteenth-century English) of <hi rend="i">Ajax</hi> (ff. 3-22) by Sophocles, and another hand made learned annotations in English, Latin, Greek. <note id="n47"><hi rend="s">47</hi> The size is indicated by the fact that in the outer margins of some leaves (ff. 96<hi rend="s">r</hi>, 101<hi rend="s">r</hi>, 102<hi rend="s">r</hi>, 104<hi rend="s">r</hi>, 106<hi rend="s">r</hi>, 107<hi rend="s">r</hi>, 115<hi rend="s">v</hi>, and 116<hi rend="s">r</hi>) there are regular rows of horizontal parallel lines as if of deletions, ending on the inner side in a sharply-defined vertical hiatus, suggesting that lines begun on now-missing octavo leaves continued from the now-missing leaves onto the quarto host-leaves.

                  <p>Blake Concordance On-Line</p>
                  <p>Nelson Hilton has created a Blake Concordance On-Line which is accessible at http://www.english.uga.edu/Blake_Concordance. It is based on <hi rend="i">The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>, ed. David V. Erdman (1988), which has been re-arranged in approximately chronological order.</p>
                  <p>The concordance uses a computer program (written in Perl) to accept a pattern of characters or characters and “wild cards,” to match that string line-by-line against the more than fifty thousand lines of the data file, and to return any lines containing a match. Each returned line is identified as to work, plate or page (e.g., <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pl. 6), and page in the Erdman edition on which it appears. Either of these identifiers may be entered on a separate screen to retrieve the larger context of a matched line.</p>
                  <p>Browsers which are “frame-enabled” may have all four (resizable) screens (two input, two result) in a single window.</p>
                  <p>Email links make possible the reporting of errors to the concordance editor, for correction of the on-line database. The Blake Concordance On-Line is an alternative to <hi rend="i">A Concordance to the Writings of William Blake</hi>, ed. David V. Erdman et al.

                <p>Blake’s engravings may have been copied not from the first printings of these designs, Vol. 1 in 1727 and Vol. 2 in 1738 (as implied by Keynes, <hi rend="i">BB</hi>, Essick, <hi rend="i">Blake’s Commercial</hi><pb id="p31-153" n="153"/><hi rend="i">Book Illustrations</hi>, et al.), but from the designs re-engraved by Gerard Van Der Gucht (London: C. Hitch, L. Hawes, et al. 1757). The evidence for this conclusion is chiefly that, compared to the original versions, the 1757 designs reverse right and left and the format is vertical rather than horizontal. The 1762 and 1767 editions revert to the earliest formats. See Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 1997,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> (1998).</p>

                <p>23-25 July 1923</p>
                <p><hi rend="i">Catalogue of the Valuable Contents</hi> [of] 185, Camberwell Grove, Denmark Hill, [London] S.E., [sold 23-25 July 1923] at the Residence By Order of the Executor of R.C. Jackson by Messrs. Goddard &amp; Smith (22 King Street, St. James,’ London, S.W.1, 1923).</p>
                <p>The catalogue offers works which are said to have belonged to William Blake (#159, 182, 245, 287, 293, 465, 579f, 737, 812, 861), Thomas Carlyle (#466, 470), Charles Dickens (#966), David Garrick (#556, 571), Dr. Johnson (#538), Charles Lamb (#137, 475, 506-07, 509-10, 512-13, 516), Michael Angelo (#579), and “The Poet Schiller” (#464). Two of the Lamb items are said to have come from the “Moxon sale, 1805” (#506-07—see below), when Lamb’s friend Edward Moxon was four years old. The significant Blakes are 182 “By Blake. A bust Portrait of Dante (12-in. by 9-in.); a ditto of Chaucer with red cap (16-in. by 13-in.).” Martin Butlin, <hi rend="i">The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</hi> (1981) lists no portrait such as these two and nothing owned by R.C. Jackson.</p>
                <p>245 “a fine pen and ink drawing with inscription and figure cartoon by William Blake.”</p>
                <p>293 “Engraving, The Canterbury Pilgrims [<hi rend="i">?by Blake, 1810</hi>], a ditto, Scene from The Beggars Opera, Act III [<hi rend="i">surely by Blake, 1790</hi>], . . . and a letter from William Blake to Flaxman.” <hi rend="i">BB</hi> 276n3 guesses this may be the letter of 12 September 1800. The “Canterbury Pilgrims” is not in Robert N. Essick, <hi rend="i">The Separate Plates of William Blake</hi> (1983), though Essick does suggest (154) that the “R. Jackson” who gave a copy to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in 1889 may be Richard C. Jackson.</p>

and back in velvet. FORMERLY THE PROPERTY OF WILLIAM BLAKE, THE POET.” There is no other reference to such a chair which belonged to Blake, and its present whereabouts (if it survives) is unknown.</p>
                <p>579f “WILLIAM BLAKE’S PAINTING TABLE, with leather centre, tilting top and on tripod (formerly Gainsborough’s) (20-in. by 15-in.).” (See illus. 6).</p>
                <p>737 “The Book of Thel, by William Blake, 1789, in board cover, quarto size, 39 copies, and 23 royal quarto ditto.” This is plainly <hi rend="i">not</hi> the “1789” edition; probably it is the edition “Printed as Manuscript” in 1917 for the William Blake Society, of which Richard C. Jackson was President.</p>
                <p>812 “The Library of William Blake, 25 vols., and 12 vols., various, in paper covers.” Anon., “Felpham and the Poet-Painter Blake. The Thirty-fourth Meeting of the William Blake Society . . .,” <hi rend="i">Observer and West Sussex Recorder</hi>, 27 May 1914, said “books, with Blake’s Autograph” were lent for display at the meeting by R.C. Jackson (<hi rend="i">BB</hi> 681n1), but no book known to have been owned by Blake has any known association with Richard C. Jackson.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to believe that Blake, Lamb, et al. had any connection with these works before Richard C. Jackson acquired them.<ref target="n56" type="note">56</ref> Jackson was capable of “believing what he wanted to believe”;<ref target="n57" type="note">57</ref> he called himself Brother à Becket, wore monastic robes in the street, and kept his house in an “indescribable condition of filth and neglect.”<ref target="n58" type="note">58</ref><note id="n56"><hi rend="s">56</hi> Carl H.

                <p>Jackson “claimed descent from Capt. Jackson of the ‘Essays of Elia,’”<ref target="n59" type="note">59</ref> Lamb’s “dear old friend,” whom he described as “a retired half-pay [<hi rend="i">naval</hi>] officer, with a wife and two grown-up daughters, whom he maintained with the port and notions of gentlewomen upon that slender professional allowance.<ref target="n60" type="note">60</ref><note id="n59"><hi rend="s">59</hi> G.

                <p>As Lamb does not mention a son of his old friend Captain Jackson, it seems very unlikely that Richard C. Jackson was descended from him.</p>
                <p>Jackson’s grandfather was probably Francis Jackson (born c. 1784), “Citizen, Merchant and Ship Owner, of London, (Offices, Rood Lane E.C. Admitted Freeman of the Paviour City Company, 14th March, 1805.) Red House, Mare Street, Hackney” whose bookplate, headed “RELICS OF CHARLES LAMB Purchased at Edward Moxon’s Sale” is in, inter alia, GEB’s copy of John Gay, <hi rend="i">Fables</hi> (London: J. Buckland et al., 1788). His parents were Susanah and Richard Charles Jackson of Preston, County Lancashire, to whom his <hi rend="i">The Risen Life:</hi> Hymns and Poems for the Christian Year (1883; 1886; 1888; 1889) is dedicated.</p>
                <p>Richard C. Jackson (1851-1923) says that when he was “quite a boy” (c. 1860?), his father, who was born in 1810 and “associated with” Blake’s disciples, took him to tea in the house the Blakes had occupied in Hercules Buildings. There they saw Blake’s fig tree and “the luxurious vine . . . nestling round the open casement,” and his father told him that the vine and fig tree were a present to Blake from George Romney, the vine having been “grafted from the great vine at Versailles or Fontainbleau.”<ref target="n61" type="note">61</ref> Since Jackson’s father was only 17 when Blake died and cannot have seen him in Hercules Buildings (which Blake left in 1800), and since R. C. Jackson himself is exceedingly unreliable, it is not easy to accept—or to ignore—his allegations. The vine was still rampant in the neglected garden of Blake’s house in 1916. <note id="n61"><hi rend="s">61</hi> Anon., “William Blake, An Unlooked for Discovery,” <hi rend="i">South London Observer</hi>, 22 June 1912.</note></p>
                <p>R. C. Jackson <hi rend="i">may</hi> have owned books and manuscripts and furniture which had belonged to William Blake, but he probably did not. It is ironic that the only pre-1820 works in Jackson’s sale which are almost certainly from Blake have no such claim made for them—the large prints of the “Canterbury Pilgrims” and Hogarth’s <hi rend="i">Beggar’s Opera.</hi></p>

                <p>Richey argues thta Blake’s early work is often critical of the gothic (pace Malkin and Frye) and adopts classical models and that his late work echoes the classics regularly: “in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> and <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, he once again rejects the self-exulting classical morality that had been so central to his earlier compositions” (145). The evidence, however, is often wonderfully vague, e.g., “the description of the Cherub as a ‘brooder of tempests &amp; destructive War’ in [<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>] plate 91 alludes to both the storm-driven adventures of Ulysses and the martial exploits of Achilles” (164).</p>

                  <p>Blake wrote and drew on many sizes, kinds and shades of paper and on canvas, card, cardboard, copper, ivory, linen, mahogany, muslin, and pine. Of these, only paper is very precisely identifiable because of the watermarks almost always placed in fine paper, though the watermark may not show when the paper is less than a whole sheet.</p>
                  <p>All Blake’s manuscripts and his works in Illuminated Printing were created entirely by Blake, with the assistance of his wife, and we can confidently assume that copies which are not demonstrably posthumous are on paper chosen by Blake or his wife. Most of his separate prints were also almost certainly on paper chosen by Blake, as of course were his drawings and paintings.</p>
                  <p>Blake’s commercial book engravings are not included because he rarely did the printing, and, even when he did as with Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Cowper</hi> (wove paper without watermark), the publisher would have chosen the paper. However, Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Little Tom the Sailor</hi> (1800) was printed by Blake with paper he chose, and presumably there were working proofs of most of Blake’s commercial engravings pulled by Blake at his own press. Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads</hi> (1802) is an exception, for not only did Blake print the plates on paper watermarked “1802” but he also used the remainder for scrap paper—see <hi rend="i">BB</hi> 574-75 and <hi rend="i">BBS</hi> 221-22.</p>
                  <p>Information here about the paper used in Blake’s writings in manuscript and in print derives from <hi rend="i">BB</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977), <hi rend="i">BBS</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), and the supplements thereto in “William Blake and His Circle” from <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> (1994 ff.). An asterisk in a letter designating a copy of Blake’s works in Illuminated Printing indicates that more than one kind of watermark has been found in that copy.</p>
                  <p>Blake’s separate prints of “Canterbury Pilgrims,” “Christ Trampling Satan” (Blake-Butts), George Cumberland’s card, “Earl Spencer,” “Falsa ad Coelum,” “Joseph of Arimathea Preaching,” “Lavater,” “Lear and Cordelia” (Blake-Butts), “Wilson Lowry,” “The Man Sweeping,” Moore &amp; Co advertisement, and “Mrs Q” are taken from Robert N. Essick, <hi rend="i">The Separate Plates of William Blake</hi> (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1983). The dates attached to these separate prints are for the specific state on that paper; however, a few prints, such as “Canterbury Pilgrims,” Cumberland’s card, and “Christ Trampling Satan,” were pulled long after Blake’s death.</p>
                  <p>Blake’s drawings and paintings are recorded (“Butlin #”) from Martin Butlin, <hi rend="i">The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</hi> (New Haven: Yale UP, 1981); the table of watermarks on 627 was correlated with the entries themselves for the dates. N.b. Most of the entries in Butlin imply but do not say that they are on paper, and very few of those so identified record anything about a watermark.</p>
                  <p>Works in <hi rend="i">BB</hi> (etc.) which are also in Butlin and Essick are taken from <hi rend="i">BB.</hi></p>
