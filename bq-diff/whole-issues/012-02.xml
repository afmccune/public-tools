        <p>This passage, a type of the cosmogonic moment variously presented by Blake, has
                    largely been passed over in the silence accorded self-evident meaning, or when
                    discussed, glided through with such selective paraphrase and assured comment as
                    to belie any but an undemanding significance.<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> The three sections present a nearly simultaneous temporal unity
                    ("And all the time. . . . While. . . . While") strongly grounded in a
                    sequence of interrelated images, already suggesting to the painstaking reader
                    that the passage is structured around a coherent underlying meaning. <note id="n2"><hi rend="s">2</hi> D. J. Sloss and J. P. R. Wallis remarked in

                        definitely mental significance is to be read into this myth. For it is

        <p>A first reading reveals that the Atmospheres are woven, spread through space and
                    then reintroduced as a spirit-catching and spirit-condensing net. In the first
                    of two brief notes on the passage (E 871), Bloom answers the strangeness of the
                    "first spun, then wove" Atmospheres with a reference to <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> 7.241, where God "spun out the Air." Milton

        <p>The scientific exactitude of "Atmospheres" calls attention to the
                    figurative loom in which they were woven. The formula "Looms erected"
                    recalls an image fifteen lines earlier where the Children of Man, "schools
                    Erected forming Instruments / To measure out the course of heaven"
                        (28.20-21).<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> The looms are the schools of
                    warped thought, an image presented more explicitly in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, where <q> I turn my eyes to the Schools &amp; Universities

                    manufacture, contain the mind-loom in its perceptual and physical shell.<ref target="n5" type="note">5</ref> "Beneath" the caverns is without,
                    the vast unknown of the unconscious. <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and
                        Hell</hi> presents a similar transition: "an Eagle with wings and
                    feathers of air, he caused the inside of the cave to be infinite" (pl. 15).
                    This mental space was entered by Er at the end of the <hi rend="i">Republic</hi>
                    in one of the earliest journeys through the unknown. There he saw "the
                    light which binds heaven" and, hanging from its extremities, "the
                    spindle [atraktos] of Necessity" and its "weight" [sphondulos]
                    (616c ff., cf. <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> 35. 14-15). The "Atmospheres"
                    offer a later instance of that myth. Ostensibly as natural as the air we
                    breathe, the "Atmospheres" are in fact woven by "the
                    Spider," known for his entrapping web of thought, and the "Worm,"
                    who otherwise spins the veiling cocoon of "silken thought" (cf. <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, 1.157-58). <note id="n4"><hi rend="s">4</hi>
                        Night the Second, with half of Blake’s ten uses, is the center for

        <p>The close proximity of the formulaic "wingd shuttle" to the
                    "wing’d Eagles" intimates that those "Human forms"
                    are being manipulated by the "Spider" and "Worm," an
                    impression strengthened by the fact that the Eagles "bend," where
                    those weavers "plied"—a very rare verb for Blake, a significant
                    meaning of which was "to bend."<ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref>
                    Both shuttle and Eagles are moving back and forth filling up space. These eagles
                    suggest the great scientists of the century, like Halley and Newton, who, even
                    in life, were very commonly presented as pursuing extramundane, cosmic voyages
                    of intellect.<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> Here Blake sees them drawing
                    their threads or theories of aethereal atmosphere behind them—bringing
                    not light, but darkness visible. This point is confirmed by the application of
                    the remaining three instances of "venturous" to the spider-scientist

                    holy place and the most holy" (Ex. 26:32, 33, et al.). In Night the Second
                    the golden hooks are suns. The woven Atmospheres/curtains which serve also as
                    "the vehicles of light" suggest Newton’s formulation of
                    "an ethereal medium, much of the same constitution with air, but far rarer,

        <p>Atmosphere is both woven and fluid at the same time. Its aethereal nature blends
                    into "particles" and "currents," the proper combination of
                    corpuscular and wave theory: "A ray of light is a continued stream of these

                    "strong wing’d Eagles. . . . spirits of strongest wing" that
                    originally spread the curtains (now nets), while the trapped listeners are those
                    "list’ning threads" through which the wingd shuttle plied. So
                    the spirits are bound in the web they thought to spread and the listeners are
                    woven into what they heard. <note id="n14"><hi rend="s">14</hi><q> Donne saw a different kind of mental net:<lb/> for of Meridians, and

        <p>The listeners hear the "chords" of "nature’s harmony,"
                    like the entrancing unheard musical air of the spheres. At the Wedding Feast of
                    Nature, Los and Enitharmon "listend to the Elemental Harps &amp; Sphery
                    Song" (13.1) presented by the "Bright Souls of vegetative life"
                    (13.24). But in Night the Second the flute and mendacious lyre are instruments
                    ("schools Erected forming instruments") playing a seductive,
                    fallacious harmony. In Night the Fourth Tharmas compells Los to "choose
                    life": <q> And all the Elements shall serve thee to their soothing
                        flutes<lb/> Their sweet inspiriting lyres thy labours shall
                        administer<lb/><lb/> (52.3-4) </q> This single instance of
                    "inspiriting" indicates that the lyres are to do more than
                    "uplift moods." Los must play the lyre to draw spirits into the
                    furnaces of Urizen he is rebuilding; their bound energy is necessary to fuel his
                    work of constructing the fallen world.</p>
        <p>The passage from Night the Second concludes with the unexpected information that
                    the spirits are condensed "into little compass / Some became seed of every
                    plant . . . some / The bulbous roots . . . " It is a striking conclusion to
                    the sequence of events that began with the weaving of the Atmospheres. One such
                    process of condensation was evident in <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi>, where
                    the prophet caught the spiritual light to make the "glowing illusion"
                    of the mundane sun: <q> 4: And first from those infinite fires<lb/> The light
                        that flow’d down on the winds<lb/> He siez’d; beating
                        incessant, condensing<lb/> The subtil particles in an Orb.<lb/><lb/>
                        (5.27-30) </q> The illustration shows that sun to be "black but
                    shining" (SL 8, MHH 18). Urizen reveals in Night the Sixth that when
                    "death" shuts up his powers, he is "then a seed in the vast womb
                    of darkness" (73.8-9)—misremembering his ruined furnaces and
                    "stoned stupor" of Night the Fourth.</p>
        <p>It was probably in 1789, at the height of his involvement with The New Jerusalem
                    Church, that Blake read and extensively annotated Swedenborg’s <hi rend="i">The Wisdom of Angels concerning Divine Love and Divine Wisdom</hi>
                    (London: W. Chalklen, 1788). One of the principal motifs of the book is the
                    descending correspondence running from "the Lord" to the
                    "spiritual sun" to the "natural sun." Divine Love and Divine
                    Wisdom "appear in the spiritual world as a Sun" (no. 83, p. 69) and
                    from that sun proceed a corresponding "spiritual Heat and spiritual
                    Light" (no. 290, p. 264).<ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref> The
                    "assertion that the spiritual Sun is not Life" (e.g., according to
                    Swedenborg it is from the Lord but not the Lord, so "not life in
                    itself") annotated Blake, "explains how the natural Sun is dead"
                    (p. 268). In addition to the Lord’s presenting himself "as to Love
                    by Heat, as to Wisdom by Light," Swedenborg adds another correspondence,
                    that of "use," presented "by the Atmosphere" (no. 299, p.
                    271). Atmosphere is invoked because it is "the Continent of Heat and
                    Light" as Use is "Of Love and Wisdom" (ibid.). Thus the
                    Atmosphere is the necessary element "by means of" which the Spiritual
                    Sun "produces the varieties of all Things in the created Universe"
                    (no. 300, p. 273). There are three Atmospheres in both the Spiritual and Natural
                    Worlds, which "in descending decrease," that is, "become
                    continually more compressed and more inert" until "they are no longer
                    Atmospheres but Substances" (no. 302, p. 274). Swedenborg reiterates that
                    "the Substances and Matter, of which Earths consist . . . are, as it were,
                    the Ends and Terminations of the Atmospheres" (no. 305, p. 277). These
                    substances, however, still "have brought with them by Continuation from the
                    Substance of the spiritual Sun that which was there from the Divine" and as
                    a result continue to manifest "a perpetual Endeavour to produce Forms of
                    Uses" (no. 310, p. 280). "The <pb id="p12-84" n="84"/> first
                    Production of those Earths, when they were still recent, and in their
                    Simplicity, was the Production of Seeds" (no. 312, p. 283). The Seeds, in
                    turn, become an "image of creation" moving from their "first
                    Principles to their Ultimates," a movement characterized in Blake’s
                    annotation as "A Going forth &amp; returning" (p. 285), a perception
                    which underlies his whole work. "This World is too poor to produce one
                    Seed," Blake wrote in the margins of Reynold’s <hi rend="i">Discourses on Art</hi> (E 646), and returning to the image in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, we see that the effect of the Atmosphere is to catch
                    the Spirits of the Spiritual Sun and condense them into seeds. <note id="n15"><hi rend="s">15</hi><q> Cf. "The Little Black Boy":<lb/> Look on the rising sun:

        <p>Having worked through this involved spiritualist account some may be surprised to
                    discover that Newton was of the same mind. Indeed it is evident that Swedenborg
                    adapts material he would surely have come across in his wide scientific reading.
                    In the "Second Paper on Light and Colours," not fully printed until
                    1757 but known since its presentation in 1675,<ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref> Newton begins by supposing that the "aethereal medium"
                    is "compounded, partly of the main phlegmatic body of aether, partly of
                    other various aethereal spirits, much after the manner, that air is compounded
                    of the phlegmatic body of air intermixed with various vapours and exhalations:
                    for the electric and magnetic effluvia, and gravitating principle, seem to argue
                    such variety" (Cohen, p. 180). Blake knew these "spirits" as
                    "Devils. . . . Powers of the Air" and remarked, "the air was full
                    of them, &amp; seemd composed of them" (MHH 18). Newton continues: <q>
                        Perhaps the whole frame of nature may be nothing but various contextures of
                        some certain aethereal spirits, or vapours, condensed as it were by
                        precipitation, much after the manner, that vapours are condensed into water,
                        or exhalations into grosser substances, though not so easily condensible;
                        and after condensation wrought into various forms; at first by the immediate
                        hand of the Creator; and ever since by the power of nature; which, by virtue
                        of the command, increase and multiply, became a complete imitator of the
                        copies set her by the protoplast. Thus perhaps may all things be originated
                        from aether.<lb/><lb/> (Cohen, p. 180) </q> In one of the last
                    "Queries" added to the <hi rend="i">Opticks</hi> Newton limited
                    himself to suggesting that "The changing of Bodies into Light, and Light
                    into Bodies, is very conformable to the Course of Nature, which seems delighted
                    with Transmutations."<ref target="n17" type="note">17</ref><note id="n16"><hi rend="s">16</hi> The relevant material is collected in

                        remark: "Blake, by taking things spiritual and mental and causing the
                        Newtonian figures in his myth to condense and contract them into solids, is
                        in this way criticizing Newton’s doctrine that there could be no such
                        transformation" (p. 88).</note></p>
        <p>These two accounts may mark the distinction between "Science" and
                    "Sweet Science" which operates in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi>
                    Newton withheld his idea from publication; "The fact is," observes E.
                    A. Burtt, "Newton’s positivism was powerful enough to prevent his
                    carrying his speculations very far in this direction."<ref target="n18" type="note">18</ref> This for Blake is "Science," the suspension
                    of belief and emphasis on doubt in the interests of the profitability and
                    utility of experimental results. Swedenborg, on the other hand, though he
                    "has not written one new truth" (MHH 22) is a practitioner of the
                    "Sweet Science" of belief and imaginative relation to the world. The
                    distinction, ultimately, has to do with the place of man in the scientific
                    endeavor; for Newton, "Man exists to know and applaud" (Burtt, p. 297)
                    the order of the God of Nature in His unchanging laws, whereas for Blake the
                    Imagination is to realize itself as the Being that instituted Nature and
                    continually bodies forth new creations. The use of the term "Science"
                    for both endeavors shows that the two will eventually be one. <note id="n18"><hi rend="s">18</hi> Edwin Authur Burtt, <hi rend="i">The Metaphysical

        <p>Both Newton and Swedenborg say that the aethereal condenses in the atmosphere, so
                    that the physical world is, literally, <hi rend="i">spiritual.</hi> But while
                    Newton imagines no purpose for the "transmutations," Blake sees in
                    Swedenborg a vision of "a going forth &amp; returning," the
                    circulating, spiraling, expanding movement of the imagination. At the close of
                    the atmospheric moment in Night the Second some of the Spirits are shown
                    condensed into seed to be sown, others condensed into roots, already harvested
                    and stored in "barns &amp; garners," the "store house" of
                    thought (cf. 110[1st]. 12-13). The seeds may be new thoughts—spiritual
                    energy and enlightenment caught up in an image that will grow and bear—as
                    the roots may be accomplished thought, the organic base for further visions
                    which, Blake says, are always of "somewhat on earth."<ref target="n19" type="note">19</ref> "The Imaginative Image," writes Blake,
                    "returns by the seed of contemplative Thought" (VLJ, E 545; cf. J
                    85.27-29). In <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> it is the passage through

        <p>Blake reintroduces Swedenborg’s three atmospheres in Night the Seventh
                    (a). Los builds Golgonooza in "the nether heavens" where "new
                    heavens &amp; a new Earth" have opened. They are "Threefold within
                    the brain within the heart within the loins" (87.10) and so represent,
                    "A Threefold Atmosphere Sublime continuous from Urthonas world"
                    (87.11) or the second of the threefold atmospheres of Swedenborg’s
                    Spiritual and Natural Worlds, arranged in the traditional hierarchy of elemental
                    (loins), celestial (heart), and intellectual (head).<ref target="n20" type="note">20</ref> This second, natural Atmosphere has a "Limit
                    Twofold named Satan &amp; Adam" (87.12), or Opacity (cf. 56.19) and
                    "Translucence" (87.13, sometimes called "Contraction").
                    These two limits were in a sense present in the two aspects of the Atmospheres:
                    vehicles of light and condensing net. The medium of these two limits is itself
                    the limit to perception through it. But this atmosphere also provides a
                    necessary secure space in which to sleep and grow: <q> And we are put on earth a

        <p>One of the Eternals at their Feast in Night the Ninth describes the netting of
                    Spirits from the Eternal point of view. When man is wearied, "Folding the
                    pure wings of his mind . . . Abstracted from the roots of Science [<hi rend="i">Nature</hi> del.]" (133.14-15), then the Eternals "cast him like
                    a Seed into the Earth" (133.16). According to <hi rend="i">The Book of
                        Ahania</hi>, the Spirit is cast "On the Human soul" as "The
                    Seed of eternal Science" (5.33-34). Toward the end of the Night the golden
                    looms and wingd shuttle appear for the second time in the poem: <q> Then Enion
                        &amp; Ahania &amp; Vala &amp; the wife of Dark Urthona<lb/> Rose from the
                        feast in joy ascending to their Golden Looms<lb/> Where the wingd shuttle
                        Sang the spindle &amp; the distaff &amp; the Reel<lb/> Rang sweet the
                        praise of industry.<lb/><lb/> (137.11-14) </q> There they fabricate bodies
                    for the spectres, the spirits that the Eternal Man casts into "the world of
                    shadows thro the air" (137.31; cf. 100[1st].2 ff.). The woven atmosphere is
                    one medium of materialization, one instance of the "wide woof" which
                    flows from the looms down into the Chasms "where the Nations are gatherd
                    together" (137.17). These references converge at the end of the poem where
                    "The Sun has left his blackness" (138.20) and <q> The sun arises from
                        his dewy bed &amp; the fresh airs<lb/> Play in his smiling beams giving the
                        seeds of life to grow<lb/> And the fresh Earth beams forth ten thousand
                        thousand springs of life<lb/><lb/> (139.1-3) </q> The sun perceptible is now
                    the spiritual sun, and the earth itself is luminous with the fresh airs of
                    "sweet Science" sweeping away the stale atmosphere of binding
                    "dark Religions" (139.10).</p>

        <p>The relation of Blake’s poetry to Platonic and Neoplatonic thought has

                    parallels to <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> which these scholars have not
                    discussed. "The Philosophick Cabbala," part of More’s retelling
                    of the fall of man as narrated in the Book of Genesis, bears close resemblance
                    in many points to Blake’s retelling of the fall of man in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> The fact that <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> is a long
                    poem and "The Philosophick Cabbala" is a shorter work in prose
                    entails, of course, some distinctions in style and formal intention; but some
                    philosophic assumptions and even specific thoughts and specific passages
                    correspond so closely as to suggest comparison: these works have similar casts
                    of symbolic characters, similar accounts of the cause of the fall, and similar
                    accounts of certain consequences of the fall, and some of these similarities are
                    sufficiently close and sufficiently unusual to suggest indirect if not direct
                    relation of the two books. <note id="n21"><hi rend="s">1</hi> For book-length

        <p>Specifically, More’s concept of the "Soul’s <hi rend="i">Vehicle</hi>" (II, 20) resembles Blake’s concept of emanation.
                    Each is a feminine portion of an original, masculine character; each is the
                    faculty of joy; and each is the faculty of connecting man with the material
                    world. More describes the creation of this "<hi rend="i">Feminine</hi>
                    part" (III, 1) or "Soul’s <hi rend="i">Vehicle</hi>":
                    after the creation of the original man, Adam, "God indued the Soul of Man
                    with a Faculty of being united with vital joy and complacency to the
                    Matter" of the universe (II, 20). Blake similarly describes the creation of
                    the feminine portion of an original man: <q> The manhood was divided for the
                        gentle passions making way<lb/> Thro the infinite labyrinths of the heart .
                        . .<lb/> . . . stood before the Eyes of Man<lb/> A female bright.<lb/><lb/>
                            (84:13-16<ref target="n28" type="note">8</ref>) <note id="n28"><hi rend="s">8</hi> I use the text of <hi rend="i">The Poetry and Prose
                                of William Blake</hi>, ed. David V. Erdman (Garden City, N.Y.:
                            Doubleday &amp; Co., 1965), pp. 296-392. Citations include
                            Blake’s manuscript page number and line number as indicated by
                            Erdman.</note></q> More defines this feminine portion as the source of "vital joy"
                    and writes that she represents "joyous and chearful <hi rend="i">life</hi>" (II, 24); similarly, Blake’s representation of the
                    feminine portion, in the person of Enitharmon, says: "I wake sweet
                    joy" and "wake the bubbling springs of life" (34:85,87). Both
                    writers also clearly characterize the feminine portion of the original man as
                    the faculty of connecting him with the material world. More writes that the
                    original "<hi rend="i">masculine Adam</hi> . . . consists in pure subtile
                    Intellectual Knowledge" (II, 18), whereas the "<hi rend="i">Feminine</hi> part" (III, 1) with which he is subsequently indued
                    "is that Vital principle that joins the Soul to the Matter of the
                    Universe" (II, 20). The feminine portion of the man is the faculty of
                    sensation of matter in Blake’s description, too, and he thus catalogues
                    the bodily senses as attributes of the union of masculine character with his new
                    feminine portion: <q> They eat the fleshly bread, they drank the nervous
                        wine<lb/> They listend to the Elemental Harps &amp; Sphery Song<lb/> They
                        view’d the dancing Hours, quick sporting thro’ the sky<lb/>
                        With winged radiance scattering joys thro the ever changing light<lb/><lb/>
                        (12:44-13:3) </q><pb id="p12-88" n="88"/> Again, <q> . . . Los &amp; Enitharmon walkd forth on
                        the dewy Earth<lb/> Contracting or expanding their all flexible senses<lb/>
                        At will to murmur in the flowers small as the honey bee<lb/> At will to
                        stretch across the heavens &amp; step from star to star<lb/> Or standing on
                        the Earth erect, or on the stormy waves<lb/> Driving the storms before them
                        or delighting in sunny beams<lb/> While round their heads the Elemental Gods
                        kept harmony<lb/><lb/> (34:9-15) </q></p>
        <p>In both More’s account and Blake’s, the activation of this feminine
                    portion, with her functions of joy and connection with matter, is explicitly
                    described as a profound sleep of the man. This profound sleep has, of course,
                    its original in Genesis 2:21-22, where God is said to have caused a deep sleep
                    to fall on Adam, during which God creates Eve from Adam’s rib. Both More
                    and Blake retell the events of Genesis; but both More and Blake also interpret
                    those events and attach special significance to such symbols as the sleep. The
                    significance of the sleep, in which More and Blake largely agree, does not
                    derive directly from the narrative of Genesis, but seems to be peculiar to the
                    interpreters, and consequently to constitute a parallel that cannot be accounted
                    for by reference to their common source in Genesis. In both writers, the
                    feminine portion of the man is characterized as a state of intellectual sleep
                    and material excitement. <q> . . . God, to gratify <hi rend="i">Adam</hi>, made
                        him not indefatigable in his aspirings towards Intellectual things;
                        Lassitude of Contemplation, and of Affectation of Immateriality . . .
                        brought upon him remisness and drowsiness to such like exercises, till, by
                        degrees, he fell into a more profound sleep. At what time . . . that lower
                        Vivificative principle of his Soul did grow so strong, and did so
                        vigorously, and with such exultant sympathy and joy, actuate his <hi rend="i">Vehicle</hi>, that, in virtue of his Integrity, which he yet
                        retain’d, this became more dear to him, and of greater contentment
                        than any thing he yet had experience of.<lb/><lb/> (II, 21) </q> In
                    Blake’s account, too, the feminine portion of the man is characterized as
                    a gratifying sleep and a repose from the tiring intellectual activities of the
                    man. The emanation of Los is characterized thus: "Lovely delight of Men
                    Enitharmon shady refuge from furious war / Thy bosom translucent is a soft
                    repose" (90:5-6). Just as in More’s account the "<hi rend="i">Feminine</hi> part" was "highly invigorated in <hi rend="i">Adam</hi>, by the remission of exercise in his more subtile and immaterial
                    Faculties" (III, 1), so too in Blake’s account the feminine
                    emanation represents a drowsy slackening of exercise. Enitharmon, for example,
                    was "Once born for the sport &amp; amusement of Man" (10:25), just as
                    the "<hi rend="i">Feminine</hi> part" in More was born "to
                    gratify <hi rend="i">Adam</hi>" (II, 21); then Enitharmon is said to
                    "drink up all his Powers" (10:25), just as in More the "<hi rend="i">Feminine</hi> part" is associated with a remission of
                    Adam’s powers. Ahania, another emanation in <hi rend="i">The Four
                        Zoas</hi>, is said by her masculine portion to reflect "all my
                    indolence my weakness" (43:18), just as in "The Philosophick
                    Cabbala" the "<hi rend="i">Feminine</hi> part" is said to result
                    from a "not indefatigable" male and is associated with his
                    "drowsiness" (II, 21). This explicit and repeated characterization of
                    the feminine portion as a "Vivificative" state of material
                    consciousness and a "profound sleep" of intellectual consciousness
                    (II, 21) is another instance in which More and Blake are parallel.</p>
        <p>Blake writes that in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> he will sing of a "fall
                    into Division" (4:4), and in this very long and very complex poem, he
                    divides his symbolic characters in more ways than one. Like More, he divides
                    masculine from feminine, as described above; but he also divides an original
                    man—Albion—into "Four Mighty Ones" (3:4), the four zoas
                    themselves. These zoas are said to live "in the Brain of Man," and
                    their "bright world . . . is in the Human Brain" (11:15-16). In <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, the division of these mental faculties and a
                    contention that arises between two of them are specifically said to precipitate
                    the fall from grace; in "The Philosophick Cabbala" also, two very
                    similar mental faculties are considered separately and a similar contention
                    between them is said, equally specifically, to precipitate the fall from
                    grace.</p>
        <p>In "The philosophick Cabbala," a faculty of strong feeling, which More
                    calls "the <hi rend="i">Concupiscible</hi>," usurps the function of
                    "Reason" (III, 6), and this usurpation is given as the cause of the
                    fall from grace. Similarly, in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, Luvah, the zoa
                    of passion and lust, usurps the function of Urizen, the zoa of reason, and this
                    usurpation is given as the cause of the fall. The faculty symbolized by Luvah
                    corresponds closely to "the <hi rend="i">Concupiscible</hi>" faculty:
                    Luvah is called "Love" and his "place the place of seed"
                    (126:7-8). Urizen closely corresponds to the faculty of Reason, as his place is
                    the brain (23:12), and he receives the command from the "holy voice"
                    (64:21) to "Go forth &amp; guide my Son" (64:24), which is symbolized
                    by his command of the "horses of Light" (119:27). The contention
                    between them causes the fall in both writers’ explanations. More explains
                    the cause: "the <hi rend="i">Concupiscible</hi> . . . snatch’d away
                    with it <hi rend="i">Adam</hi>’s Will and Reason" (III, 6). Blake
                    explains with equal concision: "Urizen gave the horses of Light into the
                    hands of Luvah" (119:27), and, again, "Luvah siez’d the Horses
                    of Light" (10:13). This is the repeated description of the cause of the
                    fall in both writers. More writes that while Adam’s Reason was asleep,
                        "<hi rend="i">Adam</hi> was wholly set upon doing things . . . as the
                    various toyings and titillations of the lascivient <hi rend="i">Life of the
                        Vehicle</hi> [that is, the Concupiscible faculty] suggested to him"
                    (III, 6), and "<hi rend="i">Adam</hi> again excused himself within himself,
                    that it was the vigour and impetuosity of that <hi rend="i">Life of the
                        Vehicle</hi> . . . whereby he miscarried" (III, 12). In Blake’s
                    words, while "Urizen sleeps in the porch / Luvah and Vala woke &amp; flew
                    up from the Human Heart / <pb id="p12-89" n="89"/> Into the Brain"
                    (10:10-12). Vala is the emanation of Luvah, and is consequently a function of
                    passion, which is here again said to usurp the place of the sleeping reason.</p>
        <p>I do not argue that "The Philosophick Cabbala" is the only source in
                    which Blake could have found such a model: in <hi rend="i">Energy and the
                        Imagination</hi> Morton D. Paley, who does not mention "The
                    Philosophick Cabbala" in this connection, cites several other writers who
                    explain that "Passion subverts the place of Reason."<ref target="n29" type="note">9</ref> Nevertheless, the parallel of Urizen’s
                    [reason’s] displacement by Luvah [passion] with the Intellectual
                    faculty’s displacement by "the <hi rend="i">Concupiscible</hi>"
                    furnishes another in a series of parallels between More’s account of the
                    fall and Blake’s. <note id="n29"><hi rend="s">9</hi> Paley, 91 ff. Paley
                        cites Plato’s <hi rend="i">Phaedrus</hi>, Ovid’s story of
                        Phaeton, Prudentius’ <hi rend="i">Psychomachia</hi>, 11. 740-42, and
                        Milton’s <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>, IX:1125-31.</note></p>
        <p>The foregoing passages illustrate the parallels of the Urizen/Luvah pair with the
                    Concupiscible/Reason pair; but "the <hi rend="i">Concupiscible</hi>"
                    or "the Soul’s <hi rend="i">Vehicle</hi>" also corresponds to
                    the concept of emanation in Blake. Clearly, however, we can expect
                    Blake’s long and complex poem to contain a more complicated system of
                    symbols than More’s short prose chapters. The fact that the Vehicle seems
                    to be like the emanation in many ways and also to be like Luvah in many ways
                    need not suggest a failure of correspondence between Blake and More;
                    Blake’s longer and more complicated work contains a longer and more
                    complicated system of concepts. The sleep of Urizen and uprising of Luvah
                    parallels the sleep of Reason and uprising of the "lascivient <hi rend="i">Life of the Vehicle</hi>" in More; but, at the same time, the
                    "drowsiness" of Adam and "vital joy" of his Vehicle also
                    parallels the "indolence" and "weakness" and "soft
                    repose" of Blake’s males and the concomitant vitality of their
                    feminine portions. Thus, the dichotomy of masculine zoa and feminine emanation
                    seems to correspond closely; but when describing the usurpation of
                    Reason’s function by a "lascivient" faculty, Blake uses the
                    symbols of Urizen and Luvah. The Vehicle in More therefore parallels the
                    emanation in Blake, and it also parallels Luvah; whereas More’s shorter
                    and simpler account uses one dichotomy only, Blake’s longer and more
                    complicated account of the same story uses more than one. Both pairs in Blake
                    behave very much like More’s pair: a similar opposition of similar mental
                    faculties causes the fall from grace in both accounts.</p>
        <p>After interpreting its cause, both Blake and More describe a consequence of the
                    fall from grace which constitutes a particularly striking parallel, because it
                    has no apparent source or suggestion in their common source, the Book of
                    Genesis: both writers treat the incarnation of humans in the material world as a
                    result rather than an antecedent of the fall, and they similarly describe the
                    process by which this occurs. More writes that "the Eternal Lord God
                    decreed, that he [Adam] should descend down to be an Inhabitant of the
                    Earth" (III, 16), and Adam does so: "At last the <hi rend="i">Plastick
                        power</hi> being fully awakened, <hi rend="i">Adam’s</hi> Soul
                    descended into the prepared Matter of the Earth, and, in due process of time,
                        <hi rend="i">Adam</hi> appeared cloth’d in the skins of beasts; that
                    is, he became a down-right <hi rend="i">Terrestrial Animal</hi>, and a mortal
                    creature upon Earth" (III, 21). According to More, this is the process by
                    which all creatures are incarnated in mortal forms: " . . . God, by his <hi rend="i">Inward Word</hi> and <hi rend="i">Power</hi>, prepared the Matter
                    in the waters, and near the waters, with several <hi rend="i">Vital
                        congruities</hi>, so that it drew in sundry Souls from <hi rend="i">the
                        World of Life</hi>" (I, 20). According to More, this does not occur to
                    humanity until after the eating of the forbidden fuit; it occurs as a
                    consequence of the fall from grace. In Blake’s account, after the eating
                    of the forbidden fruit, Los exercises a "<hi rend="i">Plastick
                    power</hi>," saying: "Stern desire / I feel to fabricate embodied
                    semblances" (90:8-9). Enitharmon, his emanation, responds, urging him to
                    "fabricate forms" (90:22), which the two of them proceed to do. In
                    Blake’s account, as in More’s, a "spectrous" multitude
                    begins "Assimilating to those forms" (90:41-42): "Enitharmon
                    erected Looms" and "in these Looms She wove the Spectres / Bodies of
                    Vegetation" (100:2-4). Again, <q> Enitharmon wove in tears Singing Songs of
                        Lamentations<lb/> And pitying comfort as she sighd forth on the wind the
                        spectres<lb/> And wove them bodies . . .<lb/><lb/> (103:32-34) </q> while
                        <q> . . . Los employed the Sons<lb/> In Golgonoozas Furnaces among the
                        Anvils of time &amp; space<lb/> Thus forming a Vast family . . .<lb/><lb/>
                        (103:35-37) </q> Although in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> it is Los and
                    his emanation, and not God himself, who form the bodies into which souls
                    descend, Los is enabled to do this because "the Divine hand was upon
                    him" (100:6). Blake’s version, then, of mortal incarnation follows
                    "The Philosophick Cabbala" rather than Genesis by making human
                    incarnation in bodily form a result of the fall rather than a development that
                    occurred before it. Furthermore, both Blake and More depict the process of
                    bodily incarnation with a vision of divinely prepared matter into which
                    previously bodiless spirits descend.</p>
        <p>Although the focus of this study is on the relation of <hi rend="i">The Four
                        Zoas</hi> to "The Philosophick Cabbala," I would by no means
                    suggest that <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> alone among Blake’s poems
                    bears comparison with More’s work; Blake’s <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, for example, repeats echoes from "The Philosophick
                    Cabbala." Morton D. Paley has pointed out to me that the speech of Leutha,
                    from 11:35 through 13:6 in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, which is generally
                    recognized to recall <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>, II:747-814, also clearly
                    recalls More’s <hi rend="i">Conjectura Cabbalistica.</hi> Leutha says
                    that <q> . . . entering the doors of Satans brain night after night<lb/> Like
                        sweet perfumes I stupified the masculine perceptions<lb/> And kept only the
                        feminine awake.<lb/><lb/> (12:4-6) </q> This passage has obvious affinities
                    with More’s passage in which the "<hi rend="i">masculine
                    Adam</hi>" suffers <pb id="p12-90" n="90"/> "remisness and
                    drowsiness" as the feminine portion or "Vivificative principle of his
                    Soul did grow so strong" (II, 18,21). Further, just as More writes <q> . .
                        . Adam again excused himself within himself, that it was the vigour and
                        impetuosity of that <hi rend="i">Life in the Vehicle</hi>, which God himself
                        implanted in it, whereby he miscarried: the woman that God had given
                        him,<lb/><lb/> (III, 12) </q> Leutha, the counterpart of this feminine
                    Vehicle in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, says: "I am the Author of this
                    Sin!" (11:35) and <q> . . . my fault, when at noon of day<lb/> The Horses
                        of Palamabron call’d for rest and pleasant death:<lb/> I sprang out
                        of the breast of Satan, over the Harrow beaming<lb/> In all my beauty! that
                        I might unloose the flaming steeds<lb/><lb/> (12:8-11) </q> Here, as in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, Blake repeats the emergence of a feminine
                    portion from a masculine character, recalling the pattern in More’s work;
                    and here, too, he repeats yet another pattern found in "The Philosophick
                    Cabbala": a crisis following an intrapsychic division and a usurpation by
                    one mental faculty of another. Just as in "The Philosophick Cabbala"
                    "the <hi rend="i">Concupiscible</hi> . . . snatch’d away with it <hi rend="i">Adam’s</hi> Will and Reason" (III, 6), and in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, "Luvah siez’d the Horses of
                    Light" (10:13), in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> the pattern is repeated:
                    Leutha’s attempt to "unloose the flaming steeds / As Elynittria
                    use’d to do" (12:11-12) precipitates a crisis; "they brake the
                    traces" (12:13) and thereby bring about "A Hell of our own making.
                    see, its flames still gird me round" (12:23). In the pattern of the
                    feminine portion’s emergence, then, and in the pattern of intrpsychic
                    usurpation precipitating a crisis, <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, like <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, bears comparison with "The Philosophick
                    Cabbala." Thus, neither Blake’s tendency to recall More’s
                    work no the specific ideas and configurations that he adopts are strictly
                    limited to <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi></p>
        <p>Clearly, at any rate, "The Philosophick Cabbala" furnishes a long
                    series of parallels to <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>: there are similarities
                    between More’s "<hi rend="i">Feminine</hi> part" and
                    Blake’s emanation; between the two writers’ explanations that
                    conflicts among mental faculties caused the fall from grace; and between their
                    descriptions of the descent of spirits into bodily form as a consequence of the
                    fall. So many parallels may suggest a relation between Blake’s work and
                    More’s. The probable availability of More’s work to Blake may even
                    suggest a possible direct relation; but the internal evidence alone of so many
                    similarities constitutes at least, I believe, some indirect relation that
                    may—or may not—be coincidental.</p>

        <p>The first Night of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> is one of the most heavily
                    revised parts of the poem, and the physical evidence in the manuscript is
                    sometimes highly confusing, especially where Blake changed his mind more than
                    once about a particular revision. Blake’s editors have the daunting task
                    of trying to establish the latest revision of the text when the process of
                    revision was probably never finally completed. The conflicting evidence about
                    the ending of Night the First has been interpreted convincingly,<ref target="n30" type="note">1</ref> but there are some areas of the text which

          <p>The modified copperplate text on pages 5-7<ref target="n32" type="note">3</ref> describes how Tharmas sinks into the sea and his Spectre
                        emerges to woo Enion. A dialogue between Enion and the Spectre leads into
                        the description of their mating in the surviving copperplate lines on the
                        lower half of page 7. Hardly and of the original copperplate text that was
                        erased on pages 3-6 can be deciphered, but Erdman has reconstructed the
                        first six copperplate lines at the top of page 7 thus: <q> ? "Weeping,
                            then bending from his Clouds he stoopd his innocent head"<lb/> ?
                            "And stretching out his holy hand in the vast Deep
                            sublime"<lb/> ? "Turnd round the circle of Destiny with tears
                            &amp; bitter sighs"<lb/> And said Return O Wanderer when the day
                            of clouds is o’er;<lb/> So saying he . . . ? fell . . . into the
                            restless sea<lb/> Round rolld ?the . . . globe self balanc’d.
                        </q> It appears from these lines that in the original copperplate text the
                        union between Tharmas and Enion occurred when the "innocent"
                        Tharmas fell into the sea, and that he, rather than the Spectre, was
                        Enion’s partner. It is possible that there was no mention of the
                        Spectre in the copperplate text. Centainly, the term only appears in
                        additions in the copperplate lines surviving on page 7 (in lines 23 and 27).
                        Erdman (p. 743) observes that the first six lines at the top of page 7
                        "were apparently moved to p 5 for the modified copperplate addition
                        there of lines 9-14 and 25," and they may well have been moved towards
                        the beginning of the Night to make room for the account of the emergence of
                        the Spectre introduced on pages 5-7. It is very strange that Enion’s
                        partner in the union, in the copperplate text, should have been the
                        "innocent" Tharmas, as the description of the union on page 7
                        refers to his "horrible brightness" and his "poisons,"
                        which seem to be qualities characteristic of the Spectre. This anomaly
                        suggests that when he transcribed the copperplate text, Blake had already
                        developed a myth involving the union of Enion with a spectre-like Tharmas,
                        but that for some reason he decided to omit the description of this
                        character. Perhaps he had found no way of relating the spectre-like figure
                        to the innocent Tharmas: these conflicting aspects of Tharmas’
                        divided character are related in the modified copperplate revisions by the
                        device of the Spectre. Blake’s difficulties in the copperplate text
                        may have arisen from the fact that he had not yet invented this device, and
                        that the spectre-like character was called simply Tharmas—as in the
                        fragment page 141. <note id="n32"><hi rend="s">3</hi> In all quotations line

          <p>Bentley, commenting on this fragment, argues that "Blake was copying
                        from the copperplate draft (probably already bound at this point) into his
                        notebook." His argument rests chiefly on the fact that the lines on
                        page 144 appear as an addition on page 7, and on the observation that
                        "the first draft of the notebook clearly reproduces corrections in
                        Night I, while none of the changes introduced into the notebook are repeated
                        in Night I."<ref target="n34" type="note">5</ref> The two lines on page
                        144 reappear on page 7 as part of a modified copperplate revision describing
                        the Spectre’s relationship with Enion. If, as I suggest, the
                        description of the spectre-like Tharmas existed before the copperplate text
                        of Night I was transcribed, it follows that the lines on page 144 may have
                        existed long before they appeared as additions on page 7. Parts of the basic
                        text of both pages 7 and 143 have been obscured by subsequent revisions, but
                        there are two examples of additions on page 7 which appear in the basic text
                        of page 143. Unfortunately, both of these are problematic. On page 7
                        "Shrieking" was added in the margin before "Above the
                        ocean" in line 22; it was subsequently deleted, which suggests that
                        Blake changed his mind more than once about including it. In the same line
                        "Nature" is clearly an addition replacing "Beulah";<ref target="n35" type="note">6</ref> but "Beulah" was an addition
                        over an erased word, which introduces the possibility that when Blake
                        deleted Beulah he was restoring the original term.<ref target="n36" type="note">7</ref> In other words it is not really clear whether page
                        143 does incorporate corrections made on page 7, or whether Blake derived
                        the account on page 7 from the fragment, making changes which were
                        subsequently revoked; and the fact that none of the changes made in the
                        fragment were repeated in Night I gives no indication of relative date.

          <p>The text of page 143 has been subject to three distinct sets of revisions.
                        The earliest are probably the additions made over erasures. That Blake
                        should have bothered to make erasures here casts some doubt on the idea that
                        the fragment comes from a notebook, as it indicates that he had some concern
                        for the appearance of the page—that it was regarded in the first
                        place as a fair copy, and that the revisions were not intended to be
                        retranscribed in a subsequent fair copy. The additions made over erasures
                        were probably appropriate to the original context of the fragment, but they
                        seem inappropriate for the context of Night I. They consistently emphasize
                        that the product of the union is an epitome of the female will: the words
                        "female," "warbling," "sweet,"
                        "enrapturd" all contribute to the feeling of sexual bliss. Bentley
                        suggests that the words "Glory delight &amp; sweet enjoyment
                        born" are the beginning of "Enion’s song about the beauties
                        of the natural world."<ref target="n37" type="note">8</ref> However,
                        the song seems singularly inappropriate to Enion, who in <hi rend="i">The
                            Four Zoas</hi> consistently complains about the conditions of experience
                        (in the first two Nights she sings two great laments about the horrors of
                        the natural world). This anomaly is emphasized by a separate <pb id="p12-93" n="93"/> set of revisions in the fragment which introduce a
                        "groaning" Enion to sing the song (lines 10, 14, 15). <note id="n37"><hi rend="s">8</hi> Bentley, p. 160. Bentley apparently thinks
                            that the descriptive passage 8:14-17 was to become part of
                            Enitharmon’s song.</note></p>
          <p>In the basic text of the fragment the song is sung by the product of the
                        union of the male and female partners. Raine suggests that the description
                        of the union is derived from Ovid’s story of Hermaphroditus,<ref target="n38" type="note">9</ref> the youth who is ensnared in a river by
                        the water nymph Salmacis, until both are fused into a single, hermaphroditic
                        body. Thus, the union in the fragment appears to be a union in the literal
                        sense, a "mingling" of two bodies to form a new creature which has
                        a dual nature. Ovid’s tale is a story of female triumph, and the tone
                        of ironic rapture in the song on page 143 seems appropriate to the beginning
                        of a song celebrating the triumph of the female will. It is a song which
                        would be more appropriate to Enitharmon than to Enion (see for example
                        Enitharmon’s songs in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> and <hi rend="i">The
                            Four Zoas</hi> 34:56-90); and Enitharmon would seem to be the likely
                        product of the union of two characters called Tharmas and Enion who are
                        fused into a single, fallen being. <note id="n38"><hi rend="s">9</hi>

                            I, 282-85.</note></p>
          <p>So far, then, I have made two suggestions: (a) that in the copperplate text
                        of pages 3-7 Blake was adapting an earlier myth with only partial success,
                        omitting the description of the spectre-like Tharmas; and (b) that the basic
                        text of page 143 may have been part of a myth describing the creation of
                        Enitharmon. These are both conjectures drawn from meager evidence, but I
                        believe they are supported by other available evidence, and that they help
                        to illuminate the problem of the relative dates of pages 7 and 143.</p>
          <p>One set of revisions on page 143 is in pencil. These revisions consistently
                        modify the "bright" or spectre-like qualities of Tharmas in the
                        union. For example, "horrible brightness" becomes "horrible
                        darkness," "lovely changing colours" become "darkly
                        waving colours," and "scaly armour" becomes "rocky
                        features." All of these changes seem designed to suggest that Tharmas
                        degenerates into a desolate marine god as he mates with Enion. If Blake did
                        omit the Spectre from the copperplate text of pages 3 to 7, he may well have
                        considered making changes like these to eradicate the spectral qualities
                        which remained in the description of the union. However, being in pencil
                        they may have been tentative suggestions which Blake decided not to adopt
                        when he transcribed page 7.</p>
          <p>The remaining revisions on page 143 were in ink. Blake began these revisions
                        by inserting two lines (written as one) between lines 9 and 11: "For
                        Enion brooded groaning loud the rough seas vegetate. Golden rocks rise from
                        the vorte . . . " (part of the second line was lost when the page was
                        torn). He made a second attempt at this revision at the foot of the page,
                        lines 14 and 15. The initial half-line "Shining across the ocean"
                        would replace the end of line 9. Blake conflated the two lines of his
                        previous insertion into a single line by substituting "golden
                        rocks" in the second line for "rough seas" in the first. The
                        conflated line is followed by "The V . . . ," or "The b . . .
                        ," the remains of words which were lost when the page was torn. The
                        next line reads "[<hi rend="i">to</hi>] Infolding the bright woman [<hi rend="i">from the desolating winds</hi>]," the initial
                        "to" being part of an instruction: in other words, Blake was
                        probably indicating that another passage, from "The ?b . . . " to
                        "Infolding the bright woman . . . " should be introduced here. The
                        conflated line appears in the copperplate text of page 8 as "Enion
                        brooded, oer the rocks, the rough rocks &lt;groaning
                        vegetate&gt;," and this line introduces a description of the
                        awakening natural world which begins "The barked oak . . . " and
                        ends with the line "Infolding the bright children from the desolating
                        winds." This may have been the passage cited for inclusion in the text
                        of page 143.</p>
          <p>If the basic text of page 143 originally described how Tharmas and Enion lose
                        their individual identities to become Enitharmon, Blake would have made
                        revisions like these when he adapted the text for use in <hi rend="i">The
                            Four Zoas.</hi> Tharmas and Enion were to remain separate, and he had to
                        account for the creation of Enitharmon’s consort, Los. The added
                        reference to Enion brooding identifies the woman-serpent with Enion herself,
                        suggesting that Enion temporarily assumes this form while mating with
                        Tharmas. The additions still end with "&amp; thus her voice," so
                        at this stage Blake still intended to introduce the lyric song which would
                        be inappropriate to Enion; but the additions introduce "rough
                        seas," a "groaning" Enion and "desolating winds,"
                        all in stark contrast to the blissful tone of the rest of the passage. In
                        the copperplate text the revisions begun in the fragment are apparently
                        taken one stage further: the song is omitted; "golden rocks"
                        become "rough rocks," "golden" probably being eliminated
                        because it seemed out of keeping with Enion’s desolate condition; and
                        the "bright woman" of 143:15, a phrase inappropriate to the
                        degenerate Enion, becomes "bright children," enabling Blake to
                        suggest that both Los and Enitharmon were created by the union. It seems,
                        then, that in the fragment Blake was beginning to make necessary adjustments
                        to the tone of the passage, and that this process is more complete in the
                        copperplate text. Page 143 may represent an intermediate stage in the
                        composition of the copperplate text, and all of the revisions on the page
                        may have been made before the copperplate text was transcribed. The
                        substitution of page 143 for page 7 in the text of <hi rend="i">The Four
                            Zoas</hi> therefore seems unjustified. We must turn to the copperplate
                        text itself to establish a final text.</p>

              <hi rend="b">THE INK CIRCLES ON PAGES 5, 6, &amp; 7</hi>
            </title>
          </head>
          <p>In three places near the beginning of the poem, deleted passages were circled
                        in ink. These are: 5:46-55, Enion’s horrified reaction to the
                        Spectre; 6:26, 28-38 (a single block), the Spectre’s accusation of
                        Enion and her reply; 7:1-11, the rest of Enion’s reply to the
                        Spectre. Blake did not normally draw an ink circle around a passage he
                        wanted to delete, which suggests that these circles have a special
                        significance.</p>
          <p>The circled passage at the foot of page 5 was deleted by three slanting ink
                        strokes. However, part of the circle was erased when lines 29 and 30 <pb id="p12-94" n="94"/><figure><head><hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, p. 5.</head></figure> were added, and part of a deleting line was erased when Blake
                        revised the end of line 48 (Bentley does not record this revision, but
                        Erdman shows that "Love is changed to . . . hate" is a subsequent
                        addition). The passage was revised after it had been deleted, and after it
                        had been circled. The circled passage at the foot of page 6 was deleted by
                        two slanting ink strokes, but these strokes were partly erased when Blake
                        made additions in lines 29-31, and part of the circle was erased when Blake
                        added line 38 at the bottom of the passage. Again, this means that the
                        passage was revised after both the ink circle and the deleting lines had
                        been added. On the same page lines 9-25 were deleted by ink strokes and also
                        by a grey wash. The grey wash, however, does not cover the circled passage.
                        At the top of page 7 two long slanting ink strokes deleted the text down to
                        line 18, extending down below the ink circle (which surrounds lines 1 to
                        11). Within the circle the deleting lines were partly erased when lines 1 to
                        8 were added. Here, as in the other circled passages, the text was revised
                        after it had been deleted. Revisions to the deleted text only occur within
                        the ink circles, which suggests that the passages were first deleted, and
                        subsequently circled in ink because Blake changed his mind and decided to
                        retain them. The fact that the gray wash on page 6 avoids the circled
                        passage but covers the other deleted lines on the page seems to confirm
                        this.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>It seems possible, then, that the final text on pages 5, 6, and 7 should
                        include some lines which were once deleted, and which are not included in
                        the text edited by Erdman and Stevenson:</p>
          <p>PAGE 5. All the lines within the circle (46-55) should probably be retained
                        as none were individually deleted; but not two lines (29 and 30) added above
                        the circle, which were individually deleted by ink strokes; nor the two
                        lines below the circle—the pencilled insert line 56 (which seems to
                        have been partly erased), and line 57 (which was deleted individually by a
                        pencil stroke).</p>
          <p>PAGE 6. Line 1 follows on from 5:55. Lines 9-25 were deleted by ink strokes
                        and gray wash, and none of the deletion was superseded by subsequent
                        revisions, so these lines are definitely excluded. The circled passage
                        (lines 26-38) was revised after deletion, but some lines within the passage
                        were deleted individually in pencil. The end of the first line and all of
                        the second line ("Art thou not my slave &amp; shalt thou dare / To
                        smite me with thy tongue beware lest I sting thee also") were deleted
                        and replaced by an addition of one-and-a-half lines (the full line
                        subsequently deleted): <q> Who art thou Diminutive husk &amp; shell [<hi rend="i">Broke from my bonds I scorn my prison I scorn &amp; yet I
                                love.</hi>] </q><pb id="p12-95" n="95"/><figure><head><hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, p. 7.</head></figure> Lines 29-36 follow on from these. Part of the circle was erased
                        when line 38 was added, effectively replacing line 37 which was deleted in
                        pencil. The circled passage, thus revised, should probably be retained in
                        the text.</p>
          <p>PAGE 7. An ink circle surrounds lines 1-11, and deleting strokes within the
                        circle were superseded when lines 1-8 were added. Lines 1 and 2 were
                        subsequently deleted individually. Line 8 was revised as follows: "[<hi rend="i">Among wild beasts to roam</hi>] And thou the delusive tempter
                        &lt;to these deeds&gt; sittest before me." (The first part of
                        the line was deleted in pencil, and the words "to these deeds"
                        were written above a gap between "tempter" and
                        "sittest"). Lines 9, 10, and 11 were deleted individually in
                        pencil, but a pencilled note in the margin by line 11 reads "this line
                        to come in," indicating that the deletion of this line has been
                        revoked. The final text at the top of page 7, therefore, should probably
                        include lines 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, &amp; 11. The text continues from line 11
                        with the undeleted lines 21-26, which describe the union of the Spectre of
                        Tharmas and Enion. The transition from line 11 to line 21 is unsatisfactory,
                        and Blake made no other addition on the page to ease this transition.
                        However, as this seems to be the latest, if incomplete, revision of the text
                        of page 7, this may be the textual arrangement we should adopt.</p>

        <p>Andrew Lincoln’s demonstration that <hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 143 is not
                    necessarily later than <hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 7 is fully persuasive. I have now
                    looked once more at the manuscript and can see that my previous misconstruction
                    of the sequence of revisions had prevented me from recognizing what constituted
                    the proper final text. It had also given me misleading clues that distracted me
                    from deciphering two of the heavily erased words. I can now see that
                    "Serpent" is the original reading in 7:10 as well as in 143:4 and
                    143:8—and that the second reading in 143:8 is "female". The
                    evidence is hence clear that the final variants in page 143 constitute a layer
                    of revision intermediate between the first readings of that page and the final
                    readings of page 7. And it is impressively evident that the second
                    "half" of the creature that is half woman and half something else, in
                    7:23 and 143:4, begins as a serpent and ends as a spectre, with this sequence of
                    metamorphoses: <q> Half Woman &amp; half Serpent<hi rend="s">7,143</hi> /
                            beast<hi rend="s">143</hi> / Spectre<hi rend="s">7</hi></q> But what does this sequence establish in the other variants on these
                    pages?</p>
        <p>HYPOTHESIS 1: That the movement from serpent to beast to spectre is a spiral, the
                    spectre evolving as a higher kind of serpent.</p>
        <p>If this is true, then unchanged terms in page 7 should apply first to serpent and
                    finally to spectre. The "scaly armour" of 7:25 and 143:6 (1st rdg)
                    belongs to serpent and finally to spectre; the "rocky features" of
                    143:6 2nd rdg belong only to the beast. The "brightness" of 7:21
                    remains unchanged but shifts in 143:2 to "darkness" for the beast. The
                    combination of woman and serpent or spectre is a "monster"; the
                    combination of woman and beast is a "wonder"; it has "rocky
                    features" and "darkly waving colours" rather than the
                    "lovely changing colours" of the "monster". The somewhat
                    anomalous shift from "Serpent voice" to "female voice" in
                    143:8 seems to make both halves female: that voice is given to
                    "warbling"; but in page 7 the voice, whether of Serpent or of Spectre
                    (first and final readings), keeps to "incessant wailing".</p>
        <p>HYPOTHESIS 2: That the movement is from "Serpent" and/or
                    "Spectre" to "beast".</p>
        <p>In that case (assumed to be true by Bentley and Erdman) the changes introduced by
                    the second readings of page 143, when treated as revisions to page 7 (as in the
                    Doubleday text), produce final readings that are inconsistent with the context
                    established in pages 5 and 6, where "Spectre" is the latest reading.
                    (Keynes avoided such confusion by keeping page 143 separate as an
                    "additional fragment"; but then neither Keynes nor Bentley unearthed
                    the "beast," being lost in a misreading of that word as
                    "desart".) (For a demonstration deducing hypothesis 2 from the fact
                    that "brightness" and "scaly armour" et cetera are unchanged
                    in page 7, see Bentley, "The Composition and Growth of <hi rend="i">Vala</hi>," in his 1963 facsimile edition, p. 160, fn. 4.)</p>
        <p>The changes required in the Doubleday text and textual notes (pp. 299-300 and
                    740-42) and also in the Longmans text (pp. 298-99) can be spelled out in the
                    Doubleday format as follows:</p>

        <p>These changes in the text necessitate the following changes in the Textual Notes,
                    pages 740-43:</p>
        <p>740-41: delete everything from "Ten deleted lines follow" through
                    "line it would replace"; insert the following:</p>
        <p>Lines 44-53 were cancelled by three diagonal strokes but then circled in ink for
                    restoration to the text. (For a convincing demonstration that such circling, on

                    after the 17th line, ending "manifest," to the end of the note (i. e.
                    from "The Spectre thus spoke" through "wrath of Tharmas").

        <p>Page 7 is a thicket of erased and deleted original and additional lines. The top
                    block of 9 added lines has been deleted, then restored by an ink circle, then
                    heavily revised; the last of these (line 7 in the present text) is so crossed
                    out and mended that to restore it Blake has written "This line to come
                    in" alongside it. The lower half of the page consists of original
                    copperplate writing, with some mending and some deletion of lines. The undeleted
                    original lines appear also on p 143 (a <figure><head><hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, p. 7 (detail).</head></figure> smaller leaf but neatly written as if begun as fair copy, perhaps of a

                        by Gods &amp; Men </q> The revision to "Spectre" suggests that p
                    143 was put aside before these line on p 7 were deleted. Page 143 originally
                    continued, after a stanza break: <q> And thus her voice; &lt;Glory, delight,
                        &amp; sweet enjoyment born&gt;<lb/> &lt;To mild Eternity shut in a
                        threefold shape delightful&gt;<lb/> To wander in
                        &lt;sweet&gt;solitude&lt;enrapturd&gt;at every wind </q>
                    (The second line and the two words bracketed in the third were written over
                    erasures.) In the break before these three lines and in the bottom margin below
                    them are two versions of a passage to be adapted from the deleted copperplate
                    text of p 8 and to be followed by line 11 ("And thus her voice") et
                    cetera. In the deleted text (lines 5-13 following 8:7) Enion broods, after
                    bearing two infants, and vegetation grows up from the rough rocks to shelter
                    them. The revision may be intended to have the vegetation grow up to shelter
                    Enion <hi rend="i">before</hi> she gives birth to the children.</p>
        <p>The version at the bottom of p 143 (possibly written first) is crowded in like
                    prose but may be lined out, with the help of Blake’s slashes and
                    capitals. It begins with a half line that could be meant to replace "a Self
                    enjoying wonder" at the end of 143:9: <q> Shining across the ocean /<lb/>
                        Enion brooded groaning the golden rocks vegetate<lb/> The b . . . [paper
                        torn away]<lb/> to<lb/> Infolding the bright woman from the desolating winds
                        /<lb/> &amp; thus her voice &amp;[c] [paper torn away] </q> The suggestion
                    is to follow the "Enion brooded" line with its successor (before
                    insertions) in p 8 which reads: <q> The barked Oak, the long limbd Beech; the
                        Ches’nut tree; the Pine. </q> and to continue the passage, which
                    fills five more lines with vegetation and animation, to conclude with Infolding
                    the bright Infants from the desolating winds</p>
        <p>—with the woman replacing the Infants. Blake subsequently deleted all
                    these instructions except the phrase "Infolding the bright woman".</p>
        <p>The alternative version, undeleted, consists of a double line crowded into the
                    stanza break between "a Self enjoying wonder" (presumably to be left
                    intact) and "And thus her voice". Here the vegetating process is more
                    complex, involving seas, rocks, and vortex: <q> For Enion brooded groaning loud
                        the rough seas begetate.<lb/> Golden rocks rise from the [<hi rend="i">vorte</hi> . . . ]&lt;vast&gt; [paper torn] </q> Possibly the
                    plan was to have this triple vegetating proceed at once to "Infolding the
                    bright woman" (undeleted portion of the first version): it would make up a
                    full line (if there weren’t too many words on the torn paper): and
                    perhaps to conclude as before with "Thus her voice" et cetera.</p>

        <p>Of all the abrupt shifts in the plot of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, perhaps
                    the most startling is the sudden embrace of Los and the Spectre of Urthona in
                    Night VIIA, the climactic reversal of the pattern of further and further
                    fragmentation in the poem, the first unequivocal gesture toward reconciliation
                    that results finally in the reunification of Albion in Night IX. Nothing in the
                    immediate situation leads up to this right-angled turn in the action.<ref target="n39" type="note">1</ref> On the contrary, Blake erased "End of
                    the Seventh Night" in order to write in the account of this embrace, thus
                    changing the natural stopping point for the Night into a surprising turning
                    point for the entire poem. The reconciliation scene follows immediately upon the
                    Spectre’s re-enactment with Enitharmon of the fall of Adam and Eve,
                    during which they copulate and engender the Shadowy Female, whose appearance
                    releases "male forms without female counterparts or Emanations / Cruel and
                    ravening with Enmity &amp; Hatred &amp; War / In dreams of Ulro dark delusive
                    drawn by the lovely shadow" (VIIA.329-31; 85:19-21, E353).<ref target="n40" type="note">2</ref> The only grammatical, temporal, and logical transition
                    between the moment of the Shadowy Female’s birth and the moment of
                    Los’s embrace of his Spectre is "But then" (VIIA.336; 85:26,
                    E353). This juxtaposition of scenes of fall and redemption, spectrous enmity and
                    genuine fraternal love, is related to the Blakean paradox that revelation is
                    concurrent with—and contingent upon—the consolidation of error. It
                    is not difficult to grasp the thematic purpose of the juxtaposition, then, but
                    as a quasi-realistic dramatic scene among members of a love-triangle who
                    symbolize aspects of the imaginative faculty, it raises numerous problems of
                    interpretation. Should this apparently arbitrary gesture of loving forgiveness
                    be considered a structural weakness of the poem? Does it indicate a lapse in the
                    profoundly accurate insight into human psychology that Blake’s work
                    usually exhibits? Does the suddenness of reversal reflect a religious or
                    psychological conversion of the man Blake, as John Middleton Murry surmised?<ref target="n41" type="note">3</ref> Or, perhaps, may Blake be saying that he
                    does not know how such apparently unconditioned recoveries happen but that they
                    do and must happen, through the agency of imagination, a going out of ourselves
                    into others? <note id="n39"><hi rend="s">1</hi> M. H. Abrams, <hi rend="i">Natural Supernaturalism: Tradition and Revolution in Romantic

                            and work; it expresses Blake’s own discovery that the final
                            resistance to vision lies within the artist himself, "a necessary
                            element of [his] being," and by recognizing and receiving his
                            spectrous personality, "Los-Blake attains a new understanding, a

                            quite suddenly when he was proceeding to a simpler climax, and
                            occasioned the rewriting of Night VII, if not of the next two Nights as
                            well" (p. 298). As for the significance of the Spectre himself, S.
                            Foster Damon, <hi rend="i">William Blake: His Philosophy and
                                Symbols</hi> (1924; rpt. Gloucester, Mass.: Peter Smith, 1958),
                            identifies Urthona as Spirit, Los as Poet, Enitharmon as Inspiration,
                            the Spectre of Urthona as Spiritual Logic, the Spectre of Los as Poetic
                            Logic, and the Shadow of Enitharmon as Suppressed Imagination (p. 379).
                            Frye has identified the Spectre with "clock time," "the
                            will," and—in a poet—"what is usually called the
                            ‘man’ in him" (p. 292); he is "the inventive
                            faculty," a sorcerer’s apprentice as capable of inventing
                            instruments of destruction as works of art, and is expressed in society
                            as the "sheer automatic compulsion to produce" (pp.
                            294-95).
                        <p>The significance of the Spectre is illuminated by Bloom’s use of
                            apt analogies from Shelley: the Spectre is "the ruin or desolation
                            that shadows love" near the end of the first act of <hi rend="i">Prometheus Unbound</hi> and the doubting, negating First Spirit in

                            has briefly noted that the Spectre embodies a sense of absurdity that

                            redemptive ("Blake’s Spectre," in <hi rend="i">Studies

        <p>The dramatic reversal takes place on two planes of action, signifying the
                    importance of imagination both in artistic creation and in intimate personal
                    relationships. Insofar as Los, the Spectre, and Enitharmon are fragmented
                    aspects of the imaginative faculty, representing the artist, his self-doubt, and
                    his inspiration, the sudden shift from hostility to cooperation means that the
                    mature artistic imagination becomes capable of acknowledging inner doubt and
                    sublimating it in art. Insofar as Los and Enitharmon are a husband and wife
                    whose deteriorating relationship has been further strained by the competition
                    for Enitharmon between Los and his false personality, the Spectre, the sudden
                    shift from sexual rivalry to fraternal cooperation and marital concord must mean
                    that imaginative love is capable of overcoming jealousy and self-division. On
                    both these planes of action the contact of Los and Enitharmon with the Spectre
                    is all-important.</p>
        <p>Until the moment of the fraternal embrace, the primary bond among the three
                    estranged fragments of the primal Urthona is a sexual attraction, rivalry, and
                    jealousy so intense that Enitharmon is very nearly split into two characters.
                    The problematical new figure called the Shadow of Enitharmon is not a separate
                    person but rather a manifestation of that element in the female personality
                    which is attracted to selfishness and deadness in the male and repelled by vital
                    desire. The Shadow corresponds to one side of the Spectre’s character,
                    but she is not a complete counterpart to him. During her entire relationship
                    with the Spectre, at the roots of the Tree of Mystery, Enitharmon remains
                    physically present to <pb id="p12-101" n="101"/> Los, outstretched upon his
                    knees, in his upper region above the branches of the Tree. While she is
                    indulging her shadowy moods or fantasies, she appears to Los as "the image
                    of death upon his witherd valleys" (VIIA.172; 81:13, E349). He complains
                    that she is cold and wintry when he approaches her but summery and delectable
                    when he is absent. Whenever Enitharmon is dead to Los, her Shadow is alive to
                    the Spectre. In her relationship with Los, she has given birth to Orc, a fully
                    defined character, the personification of energy. In her relationship with the
                    Spectre "in sweet delusion" (VIIA.229; 82:35, E351) she becomes the
                    mother of the Shadowy Female, a vague manifestation of Vala who exists briefly
                    during one stage of the consolidation of error, before reappearing in definite
                    form in Night VIII as the new characters Rahab and Tirzah. The specific,
                    localized affinity between the Shadow and the Spectre is seen in their parallel
                    accounts of humanity’s fall from Eternity, in which both reveal an acute
                    sense of sexual jealousy and possessiveness. In short, the Shadow represents the
                    fickle, self-deluded side of Enitharmon; by the device of separating Enitharmon
                    from her Shadow Blake is able to dramatize a stage in her education without
                    making it necessary for Enitharmon, in her primary personality, to renounce the
                    wisdom she has gained through her suffering in Night V. Traces of the old
                    Enitharmon, power-mad and sadistic, appear only in deleted lines: "She
                    Secret joyd to see She fed herself on his Despair She said I am avengd for all
                    my sufferings of old" (VIIA.177-78; E755). Since she has still not learned
                    to love her husband either as creative artist or as craftsman, she is brought
                    down through her Shadow to mate with the "lower" side of Los in
                    preparation for accepting him at his best.</p>
        <p>Enitharmon’s scorn of Los and her pleasureless coupling with the Spectre
                    are not especially remarkable among the numerous experiences of fallen sexuality
                    in the poem. The turning point for Enitharmon comes as she gives birth to the
                    Shadowy Female. In the "Worlds above" Los weeps in anguish because he
                    cannot perceive the cause of her travail (VIIA.318-20; 85:8-10, E353), but in
                    the "deeps beneath" her "shadow pregnant" brings forth the
                    Shadowy Female, whereupon the gates of Enitharmon’s heart burst from
                    their hinges (VIIA.316-24; 85:6-14, E353). It seems that imaginative
                    productivity is now possible only at this debased level, but that as a result of
                    this act of procreation, in which the Shadow and Spectre externalize their worst
                    selves in the form of the Shadowy Female, both are purified. Blake’s
                    language here is effectively ambiguous: Enitharmon writhes "till her shadow
                    was deliverd then she ran / Raving about the upper Elements in maddning
                    fury" (VIIA.321-22; 85:11-12, E353). This means both that the true
                    Enitharmon writhes until the shadowy Enitharmon gives birth and that in giving
                    birth Enitharmon is delivered of her shadowy personality. The Shadow of
                    Enitharmon is heard of no more, and the true Enitharmon, now permanently
                    heart-broken (but also made open-hearted and tender-hearted), becomes the
                    vehicle for the Spectre’s passage back to Los: "Every sigh &amp;
                    groan / Of Enitharmon bore Urthonas Spectre on its wings" (VIIA.336-37;
                    85:26-27, E353). This statement appears immediately after "But then the
                    Spectre entered Los’s bosom" and, while taking away none of the
                    element of surprise, partly explains how the miraculous embrace was made
                    possible.</p>
        <p>Drawing on the accounts of the fall which she and the Spectre had exchanged after
                    partaking of the fruit of the Tree, "Enitharmon told the tale / Of
                    Urthona" to Los, whereupon Los embraces the Spectre and gives up "his
                    Domineering lust" (VIIA.338-41; 85:28-31, E353). Los, the creator of the
                    Chain of Jealousy in Night V, is impelled to accept his rival for the sake of
                    reunifying the divided fragments of Urthona: "Come then into my Bosom
                    &amp; in thy shadowy arms bring with thee / My lovely Enitharmon. I will quell
                    my fury &amp; teach / Peace to the Soul of dark revenge &amp; repentance to
                    Cruelty" (VIIA.367-69; 86:10-12, E354). Correspondingly, "Urthonas
                    spectre in part mingling with him comforted him / Being a medium between him
                    &amp; Enitharmon" (VIIA.397-98; 87:26-27, E355). The fact that the
                    reconciliation of Los and his Spectre takes place against a background of sexual
                    rivalry emphasizes the importance of the imagination in human relationships as
                    well as the arts. The overcoming of jealousy is an act of imagination as surely
                    as the writing of a poem. Enitharmon’s withdrawal from this scene of
                    "Extacy &amp; Love" to hide "beneath Urizens tree"
                    indicates, however, that the importance of imagination in overcoming guilt and
                    shame has not yet been fully realized. Full union of Los and Enitharmon does not
                    occur within fallen history; it is "not to be Effected without Cares &amp;
                    Sorrows &amp; Troubles / Of six thousand Years of self denial and of bitter
                    Contrition" (VIIA.399-400; 87:28-29, E355). Though Los is now able to see
                    the Lamb of God within Enitharmon’s broken heart, Enitharmon herself
                    shrinks before the punishment she is sure the Lamb will inflict.</p>
        <p>In releasing the imagination to function in life as well as art, the Spectre, who
                    among other things personifies the artist’s self-censorship, plays a
                    crucial role, and Blake’s characterization of this figure is extremely
                    subtle. His prominence in Night VIIA seems to indicate that the selfish
                    impediment to creativity has come to realize that it cannot be overcome by mere
                    repression, enslavement to Los, but must be acknowledged and dealt with
                    honestly, as the Spectre insists to Los in the very act of embracing him
                    (VIIA.336-51; 85:26-39, E353). Despite his repellent attributes, he reveals even
                    as he seduces Enitharmon a spiritual and psychological perceptiveness not yet
                    possible for her. Although his boast to her that he is the creator and superior
                    of Los is unfounded, his nostalgia for the unity and happiness of Eternity is
                    genuine, and he can see the possibility and necessity for reunion with their
                    Emanations of Tharmas, Luvah, and himself as Urthona. He also deplores his own
                    spectrous condition, knowing that spectres as such are insane, brutish, and
                    deformed; and he interprets his longing for Enitharmon as evidence that he is a
                    spectre of the living rather than of the dead (VIIA.269-310; 84:3-40, E352). As
                    a spectre himself, he perceives the threat to productive activity presented by
                    imageless, disembodied thoughts of futility and negativity, the "spectres
                    of the dead."<ref target="n42" type="note">4</ref> The spectrous insight
                    which finally wins Enitharmon over is that "till these terrors [the
                    spectres of the dead] planted round the Gates of <pb id="p12-102" n="102"/>
                    Eternal life / Are driven away &amp; annihilated we never can repass the
                    Gates" (VIIA.302-03; 84:41-42, E353). It takes the spectrous side of the
                    imaginative mind to understand that the true Covering Cherub is made up of
                    one’s own shapeless, negative fears and fantasies. Regeneration, the
                    Spectre understands, is possible for him because in Los he has a living
                    counterpart which the spectres of the dead lack altogether, ravening after
                    emptiness and nothingness. After the Spectre is accepted by Los, his sense of
                    responsibility for the creation of the spectres of the dead, who were released
                    by his begetting of the Shadowy Female, is the basis of his urging Los to give
                    form and beauty to these shapeless abstractions (VIIA.401-10; 87:30-39, E355).
                    The suggestion inaugurates a great cultural renaissance, a new kind of
                    redemptive artistic activity. Even his terror at Vala’s new appearance
                    (VIIA.332; 85:22, E353) is evidence of his special insight, an insight which can
                    deepen art rather than block it, a recognition of evil and deadness that need
                    not break an artist’s spirit but can drive him to develop a more complex
                    form of art.</p>
        <p>One of the most suggestive of the Spectre’s ideas is his view of the Tree
                    of Mystery as something "given us for a Shelter from the tempests of Void
                    &amp; Solid / Till once again the morn of ages shall renew upon us"
                    (VIIA.268-69; 84:2-3, E352). This statement seems a radical distortion of the
                    truth, but it also comes very close to the Christian interpretation of the
                    "Law," the old dispensation, as a divinely-appointed stopgap, and
                    indeed in Night VIII the Lamb of God, assuming Luvah’s robes of blood,
                    will transfigure the image of the crucifixion on the Tree. Here in Night VIIA
                    the very ascendancy of the Tree of Mystery over both passion and imagination,
                    the very urgency and clarity of the sense of sin, however falsely defined,
                    builds up a pressure for imminent liberation. Despair over evil and guilt can be
                    psychologically beneficial if it awakens an acute and agonizing need for an
                    utterly new state of existence. The fact that, after the Spectre puts the
                    Shadowy Female in charge of Orc in the lower world, the topmost branch of the
                    Tree sprouts to form roots of the same Tree in the upper, conscious, world of
                    Los (VIIA.332-35; 85:22-25, E353) makes the influence of evil and Mystery
                    recognizable now on all levels of the human imagination. When the serpent-wound
                    Tree, with its outrageously false Urizenic identification of energy and evil,
                    overshadows Los, and he joins Enitharmon in eating its fruit and falls also into
                    the moral system (VIIA.395; 87:24, E355), he experiences a psychic suffocation
                    and a wasteful sense of guilt so terrible that they can only be remedied by a
                    clean break, a free existential act like that of Shelley’s Prometheus. On
                    the dramatic level this new direction is possible because Los and Enitharmon
                    have lived and suffered enough to have become different persons; in grief and
                    sorrow they have found a depth of humanity capable of reconciliation and
                    forgiveness. From no other fallen faculty can this act arise; it is truly an
                    imaginative leap. Yet this act is precipitated by the eating of the fruit,
                    through "self accusation" and "Self conviction"
                    (VIIA.385-93; 87:14-22, E354), through the assumption of an unbearable burden of
                    guilt and the definitive imposition of a clearly defined but grossly
                    misunderstood "morality," through a despair which would lead to
                    "death Eternal" but for the Spectre’s role as comforter and
                    mediator between Los and Enitharmon (VIIA.396-98; 87:25-27, E355).</p>
        <p>In retrospect, one can see that events and characterizations introduced earlier
                    in the poem, especially in Nights IV and V and earlier in Night VIIA, without
                    clear significance for human recovery when they first appeared, have contributed
                    to the moment of reconciliation. In forming a body for Urizen, for example, Los
                    had begun to feel sympathetic pains for his enemy (IV.284-95; 55:20-31, E331), a
                    sympathy that has extended even to his silent sharing of Urizen’s envy
                    (VIIA.19,27; 77:19, 27, E346). Los and Enitharmon, repenting the binding of Orc
                    in Night V, had drawn closer in their grief and become more aware of their
                    responsibilities, less selfish. The Spectre, though reluctant to cooperate in
                    Los’s labors, had shown concern for the parental distress of the couple:
                    after Los and Enitharmon fainted over Orc, the Spectre "found herbs of the
                    pit / Rubbing their temples he reviv’d them" (V.173-74; 63: 7-8,
                    E336).</p>
        <p>Undeniably, though, Blake leaves an area of disjunction between despair and
                    recovery, something not spelled out for us. But far from being a flaw in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, this gap reflects Blake’s honesty and
                    acumen. If the conversion were totally explainable, the training of
                    psychiatrists could be much abbreviated and all mental illness, perhaps also all
                    social problems related to it, could be cured in one and the same way.
                    Blake’s wisdom in leaving this hiatus of explanation is confirmed in
                    other great works which explore the spiritual dark night and recovery from it.
                    The reversal in <hi rend="i">Prometheus Unbound</hi> arises from the
                    hero’s free, imaginative act of loving forgiveness, but the <hi rend="i">agency</hi> of regeneration is embodied in Demogorgon, a personified
                    question mark, the "somehow" in statements like "Somehow we
                    survived." The same arbitrariness of recovery occurs with Wordsworth in <hi rend="i">The Prelude</hi> and with the Red Cross Knight in Book I of <hi rend="i">The Faerie Queene</hi>, where the protagonists are reduced to
                    something near despair and then rescued through a form of grace, something they
                    cannot fully understand or explain. Blake takes us further than either
                    Wordsworth or Spenser into the psychology of recovery, regeneration, renewal,
                    but like them he presents the <hi rend="i">experience</hi> of grace, not a
                    formula for obtaining it. If a formula were possible, the concept of grace would
                    not be necessary in theology nor the metaphor of the breakthrough in psychology
                    (or in the physical sciences, for that matter). It happens or it does not
                    happen; if it happens at all, it happens in the midst of despair, both because
                    of and in spite of an intolerable sense of sin and need. Even in such a
                    realistic work as "The Death of Ivan Ilyich," the conversion, when it
                    finally comes, is not explained with the fullness that is offered in the
                    presentation of the other incidents in the story. In <hi rend="i">The Four
                        Zoas</hi> Blake does not anatomize the moment of relief and reconciliation
                    itself, as he does through the splintered personalities and actions of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>; instead, he concentrates on the renewal of life as it
                    flows out from that moment.</p>
        <p>The surge of new life takes the form of creative activity. The benefits to both
                    human nature and art are reciprocal. Man’s spiritual sickness is treated
                        <pb id="p12-103" n="103"/> by therapeutic art. At the same time this
                    sickness provides new subjects for a deeper, more troubled and more complex
                    artistic vision; the pressure of these new and disturbing
                    subjects—shadows from the inner life rather than reflections of the outer
                    world—bring new art forms into being. All this is presented in the new
                    relationship among Los, the Spectre, and Enitharmon. In the unwilling drudgery
                    of their collaboration in Night IV, they had rebuilt the fallen mental and
                    physical world; art in Night IV is the mirror held up to nature—nature as
                    seen by the fallen imagination and organized according to human conceptions of
                    time and space. But in Night VII the collaboration of the Spectre and Los is
                    willing and mutual, and Enitharmon—though fearful—is cooperative.
                    Instead of working as artisan and apprentice to build a body for Urizen as in
                    Night IV, Los and his Spectre join to build in the "nether heavens" a
                    new and separate world for art, the city of Golgonooza, placed within the
                    merciful limits of Satan and Adam, opacity and contraction, discovered in Night
                    IV (VIIA. 379-83; 87:8-12, E354). <note id="n42"><hi rend="s">4</hi> Both Bloom
                        and Damon seem to think of the spectres of the dead as human beings without
                        art, or human souls without bodies (see Bloom, <hi rend="i">Blake’s
                            Apocalypse</hi>, p. 255, and Damon, <hi rend="i">A Blake
                        Dictionary</hi>, Providence: Brown Univ. Press, 1965, pp. 382-83), but the
                        context suggests that they are formless, destructive ideas and fantasies
                        which Los, with the help of the Spectre and Enitharmon, redeems by embodying
                        them in art.</note></p>
        <p>In the blended consciousness of Los and his Spectre is "a World within /
                    Opening its gates &amp; in it all the real substances / Of which these in the
                    outward World are shadows which pass away" (VIIA. 364-66; 86:7-9, E354).
                    Although the Spectre’s claim on Los, "I am thy real Self," is
                    untrue as a bald, isolated statement, it is effective as a means of forcing Los
                    to act on his moment of self-recognition. After his impulsive embrace of the
                    Spectre "first as a brother / Then as another Self; astonishd humanizing
                    &amp; in tears," Los is forced to listen to the insistent voice of his
                    repressed negative and sinister personality: <q> I am thy real Self<lb/> Tho
                        thus divided from thee &amp; the Slave of Every passion<lb/> Of thy fierce
                        Soul Unbar the Gates of Memory look upon me<lb/> Not as another but as thy
                        real Self I am thy Spectre<lb/> Tho horrible &amp; Ghastly to thine Eyes
                        tho buried beneath<lb/> The ruins of the Universe.<lb/><lb/> (VIIA. 339-52;
                        85:29-40, E353) </q> When a new world opens within and Los again embraces
                    the Spectre as well as Enitharmon, the Spectre also "Wondering beheld the
                    Center opend by Divine Mercy inspired / He in his turn Gave Tasks to Los"
                    (VIIA. 374-75; 87:3-4, E354); his destructive impulses are, however, rendered
                    harmless by Los’s concentration on the work at hand. The Spectre’s
                    claim that he is Los’s self is a demand that Los acknowledge his errors;
                    this claim on Los is entirely different from Urizen’s reductive blasphemy
                    in Night I, the insistence that there is nothing <hi rend="i">else</hi> in man:
                    "The Spectre is the Man the rest is only delusion &amp; fancy" (I.
                    341; 12:29, E303). Los directs the continued building of Golgonooza, where
                    "beneath / Was opend new heavens &amp; a new Earth beneath &amp;
                    within" (VIIA. 379-80; 87:8-9, E354), but it is the Spectre who proposes
                    the new direction for art, the creation of forms for man’s shadowy hopes,
                    fears, negative thoughts, desires, failures of nerve, frustrations: "Let us
                    Create them Counterparts / For without a Created body the Spectre is Eternal
                    Death" (VIIA. 409-10; 87:38-39, E355).</p>
        <p>The Spectre has found his place within the mature artistic consciousness as a
                    dark vision of emptiness and longing, an intimate knowledge of passion, guilt,
                    and sin, the negative and doubting shadow of idealism which annihilates the
                    ideal if it is disowned and denied but strengthens it if honestly admitted. From
                    Los’s acceptance of his Spectre comes the power of Romantic and modern
                    art which admits its own vulnerability and thus speaks to man’s doubts as
                    well as his faith. Acceptance of what the Spectre represents allows Wordsworth
                    apparently to undercut his most affirmative statements with such formulations as
                    "If this be but a vain belief." From the same source flows the power
                    of Byron’s self-deflations in <hi rend="i">Don Juan</hi>, along with his
                    self-assured mockery both of his own creation and of his reader’s
                    illusions. This is also the principle of Friederich Schlegel’s
                    "divine buffoonery" or Romantic Irony: acceptance in art of that which
                    destroys art, acceptance by the self of that which destroys the self. Just as
                    the artist’s admission of his difficulties and his incorporation of
                    negative possibilities into his work may actually serve to enrich and enliven
                    his efforts, so an acceptance of doubt can strengthen any act of imaginative
                    faith. Thus in the last two stanzas of the Intimations Ode, Wordsworth can
                    affirm the thoughts too deep for tears because he no longer shuts out the dark
                    truths avoided in strophes iii and iv.</p>
        <p>Since the Spectre’s vision is blended with Los’s own and the
                    Spectre no longer serves merely as an apprentice-slave, Los is now free to share
                    his creative work with his spouse and to turn to her for inspiration. Their
                    complementary activity in art gives rise to a new intimacy in their male-female
                    relationship. The Enitharmon who calls Los "wonder of Eternity," her
                    "defence &amp; guide," and says, "Thy works are all my joy.
                    &amp; in thy fires my soul delights" (VIIA. 447-48; 90:16-17, E356), has
                    become a different person from the tease who evaded her husband’s sexual
                    advances or even the sullen adulteress who tearfully and bitterly accepted the
                    shadowy embrace of the Spectre. In their new partnership they work like Blake
                    and his wife as draughtsman and colorist to create celestial murals (VIIA.
                    467-71; 90:35-39, E356). Enitharmon sighs forth vanishing forms from her bosom,
                    from which Los fabricates sublime and permanent forms "Such as the piteous
                    spectres may assimilate themselves into." In response to her plea for
                    "sweet moderated fury," Los, "his hands divine inspired began /
                    To modulate his fires." No longer the dogged blacksmith imposing his will
                    on his spectre, his emanation, his material, his technique, and his form, he
                    becomes the genius whom the very elements gladly obey. His flames are
                    "delighted" and the weeping spectres willingly "Assimilating to
                    those forms" become young and lovely (VIIA. 439-74; 90:8-42, E356).</p>
        <p>Troubled by the sense of sin, Los, the Spectre, and Enitharmon have felt the need
                    for redemption and have planned to use their artistic creations as sacrificial
                    offerings, ransoms for their sins. But the translucent center opened in
                    Enitharmon’s broken heart affords Los a brief glimpse of the possibility
                    of mental sacrifice, self-annihilation, mutual <pb id="p12-104" n="104"/>
                    forgiveness of each vice, the spirit of Jesus: <q> Turn inwardly thine Eyes
                        &amp; there behold the Lamb of God<lb/> Clothed in Luvahs robes of blood
                        descending to redeem<lb/> O Spectre of Urthona take comfort O Enitharmon
                        Couldst thou but cease from terror &amp; trembling &amp; affright<lb/>
                        When I appear before thee in forgiveness of ancient injuries<lb/> Why
                        shouldst thou remember &amp; be afraid. I surely have died in pain<lb/>
                        Often enough to convince thy jealousy &amp; fear &amp; terror<lb/> Come
                        hither be patient let us converse together because<lb/> I also tremble at
                        myself &amp; at all my former life.<lb/><lb/> (VIIA. 415-23; 87:44-52,
                        E355) </q> Although Enitharmon resists this vision and persists in seeing
                    Jesus as punisher, Los has discovered the spirit of self-sacrifice and mutual
                    forgiveness that opens the Gates of Paradise. In his appearance before
                    Enitharmon "in forgiveness of ancient injuries" he is an embodiment of
                    Jesus, and in having "died in pain / Often enough to convince thy jealousy
                    &amp; fear &amp; terror" he has enacted what is meaningful in
                    Jesus’ death, the loving gesture of self-annihilation. If this husband
                    and wife could forgive each other, they wouldn’t need a Redeemer, nor
                    would they need to sacrifice their "children," their mutual creations,
                    to an imagined Accuser. No more is said in Night VIIA about Los’s vision
                    of Jesus, but when the moment for sacrifice comes <q> Los loved them &amp;
                        refusd to Sacrifice their infant limbs<lb/> And Enitharmons smiles &amp;
                        tears prevaild over self protection<lb/> They rather chose to meet Eternal
                        death than to destroy<lb/> The offspring of their Care &amp; Pity Urthonas
                        spectre was comforted<lb/><lb/> (VIIA. 482-85; 90:50-53, E357) </q> The
                    imaginative act of creating form, of embodying these ghostly negative ideas, has
                    taught Los and Enitharmon how to sacrifice themselves, not their
                    "offspring." No longer are they the selfish parents who sacrificed Orc
                    to their own jealousies in Night V. Through their artistic endeavors they have
                    given living form to the deadly aggressions that fuel the Urizenic wars; they
                    are now able to see their enemies, Urizen and his eldest son Thiriel, as their
                    own children, Rintrah and Palamabron (VIIA. 476-94; 90:44-62, E356-57). The
                    possibility of a reconciliation with Orc is also suggested: "Orc was
                    comforted in the deeps his soul revivd in them / As the Eldest brother is the
                    fathers image So Orc became / As Los a father to his brethren." Tharmas,
                    organizing instinct now fallen into shapelessness, is heartened by the new forms
                    being created, for he hopes to find among them his lost Enion (VIIA. 478-87;
                    90:46-55, E356-57), the hope that had proved vain in the earlier craftsmanlike
                    work of Los in Night IV (IV. 32-33; 48:9-10, E325). Even Urizen finds
                    himself—or a portion of himself—in the loving and shaping hands of
                    a Los who now loves him, and who is surprised at his own ability to love (VIIA.
                    496-99; 90:64-67, E357).</p>
        <p>Although Los’s conflict with his Spectre is a major theme of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, the spectrous embrace is not a part of its resolution.
                    Perhaps Blake thought tightness of plot and clarity of motivation were more
                    important than the theme of Los’s acknowledgement and acceptance of his
                    negative double. In <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> there is no disjunction between
                    juxtaposed scenes of error and illumination, no sudden reversal. Instead, Los
                    first attempts in vain to resist the forces that separate him from his Spectre
                    and Emanation: <q> Los rag’d and stamp’d the earth in his might
                        &amp; terrible wrath!<lb/> He stood and stampd the earth! then he threw
                        down his hammer in rage &amp;<lb/> In fury: then he sat down and wept,
                        terrified! Then arose<lb/> And chaunted his song, labouring with the tongs
                        and hammer:<lb/> But still the Spectre divided, and still his pain
                        increas’d!<lb/><lb/> (<hi rend="i">J</hi>6:8-12, E147, K625) </q>
                    When the separated Spectre attempts to block Los’s work, the artist
                    combats his influence first by kindness and then by self-assertion. In his first
                    speech to the Spectre, he sounds as though he has already learned the lesson of
                        <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, Night VIIA: <q> I know that Albion hath
                        divided me, and that thou O my Spectre,<lb/> Hast just cause to be
                        irritated: but look stedfastly upon me:<lb/> Comfort thyself in my strength
                        the time will arrive,<lb/> When all Albions injuries shall cease, and when
                        we shall<lb/> Embrace him tenfold bright, rising from his tomb in
                        immortality.<lb/><lb/> (<hi rend="i">J</hi>7:52-56, E149, K626) </q> It is
                    Los’s resolution, self-confidence, and unselfish concern with
                    Albion’s regeneration that give him power over his Spectre in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, a point just touched upon in Night VIIA, when the
                    Spectre’s desire to destroy Los’s body is defeated by Los’s
                    concentration on the building of Golgonooza. Los’s stern words to his
                    Spectre, out of context, might even be mistaken for one of Urizen’s
                    threatening speeches against Albion: <q> unless<lb/> Thou abstain ravening I
                        will create an eternal Hell for thee.<lb/> Take thou this Hammer &amp; in

        <p>This change in Los’s tone toward his Spectre in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> may indicate, however, not that Blake had changed his mind
                    about the importance of the embrace in Night VIIA but that in the illuminated
                    book he was concerned primarily with the establishment of Los’s authority
                    and control, the attitude toward one’s Spectre that one must assume as a
                    day-to-day working artist. Los’s gesture of wiping the dark tears of his
                    Spectre in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 10:60-61 suggests that Los is still aware
                    of the Spectre as a brother, if not as another self. The final resolution of the
                    conflict occurs in Chapter IV, when Los, after allowing his Spectre freedom to
                    produce his anticreation, smites the Spectre upon his anvil "&amp; every
                    Ratio of his Reason / He alterd time after time, with dire pain &amp; many
                    tears / Till he had completely divided him into a separate space" (<hi rend="i">J</hi>91:50-52, E249, K739). Yet in the final plate of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> the Spectre is shown to be present as in his best moments in
                        <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, cooperating with Los and Enitharmon,
                    carrying out his proper duties as Los’s assistant, working with the
                    material of the fallen universe. Though the text of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                    never presents a reconciliation scene, this concluding design suggests that
                    Blake continued to accord the Spectre his subordinate but significant function
                    in shaping the products of imaginative activity.</p>

        <p>The presence of two seventh Nights in the perplexing manuscript of Blake’s
                        <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> is a scholarly puzzle which has two
                    theoretically distinguishable aspects. First there is the editorial problem of
                    finding the least imperfect arrangement of the two Nights within the text of the
                    poem; then there is the interpretive problem of deciding what imaginative place
                    each Night has in the poem as a whole. The two problems really overlap, of
                    course, for critical issues arise in editorial debate as "internal
                    evidence," and responsible interpretation must be consistent with a factual
                    understanding of the manuscript. Even from a primarily interpretive standpoint,
                    moreover, it is occasionally more illuminating to sift through the hectic
                    evidence of Blake’s deletions, additions, and revisions in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> than to treat the present text as if it were a fully
                    intentional work. The study of the manuscript can itself become a kind of
                    interpretation, for part of the significance of the poem resides in the story of
                    artistic growth and struggle which the manuscript obliquely reveals.</p>
        <p>Yet there has been a certain tendency to divorce textual scholarship from
                    critical interpretation in the study of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, and in
                    the debate over the VIIa-VIIb problem in particular.<ref target="n43" type="note">1</ref> In its commitment to a synoptic overview of
                    Blake’s entire canon, its preoccupation with the basic structural
                    principles of his symbolic system, what one may call the main critical tradition
                    in modern Blake studies has had very little to say about the manuscript of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> Prior to David Wagenknecht’s fairly
                    recent discussion of the two Nights seven in <hi rend="i">Blake’s Night:
                        William Blake and the Idea of Pastoral</hi>,<ref target="n44" type="note">2</ref> there had been to my knowledge no really detailed critical
                    examination of internal evidence bearing on the problem. On the other side,
                    Blake’s editors have been equally reluctant to become "readers"
                    in the Damon-Frye tradition, preferring either to remain within the precincts of
                    textual scholarship, or to employ such alternative critical methods as
                    Erdman’s "historical approach."<ref target="n45" type="note">3</ref> In some ways, no doubt, this division of perspectives is desirable;
                    yet it has probably lent some obscurity to the problem of the Nights seven, and
                    to the poem as a whole, which is not purely Blake’s own. In what follows
                    I try to give a systematic account of the critical and editorial alternatives
                    associated with the VIIa-VIIb problem, synthesizing previous arguments and
                    adding a number of observations based on my own reading of the poem. 
                    <note id="n43"><hi rend="s">1</hi> An exception to this general tendency is
                            Morton Paley’s <hi rend="i">Energy and the Imagination: the

                            of the ambiguity of the two Nights seven. A similar approach is taken by

                            Blake’s "development," however, both studies tend to
                            exclude any sense of final coherence in the structure of the poem.

        <p>Both Nights are headed "Vala / Night the Seventh" and VIIb contains in
                    addition a marginal note, "Beginning of Night VII," and an interlinear
                    note, "Beginning of the Seventh Night," both inserted at line 153
                    after Blake decided to change the internal order of the Night. "End of the
                    Seventh Night" is written at the end of VIIb, and the same phrase occurred
                    after the last line of VIIa at two or possibly three different stages of
                    revision, but Blake erased it each time to add new material, and after his
                    latest additions he did not replace it.<ref target="n46" type="note">4</ref> All
                    the leaves of VIIa except the last three bear stitch-marks which indicate that
                    at one time the Night was bound up in a grouping which included most of the
                    present Night III and all of IV, V, and VI; the unstitched leaves were
                    presumably added after Blake had unbound the others. The fact that VIIb bears no
                    stitch-marks indicates that it, like Nights VIII and IX and the added leaves of
                    VIIa, was never bound. <note id="n46"><hi rend="s">4</hi> See G. E. Bentley,
                        Jr., <hi rend="i">William Blake: Vala or The Four Zoas: A Facsimile of the
                            Manuscript, a Transcript of the Poem, and a Study of Its Growth and
                            Significance</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon, 1963), p. 162 col. 2. I am, of
                        course, indebted to Bentley throughout.</note></p>
        <p>The traditional explanation of the rival Nights is that Blake wrote VIIb first,
                    later grew dissatisfied and wrote VIIa to replace it, and then simply failed to
                    decide what should be done with VIIb. Thus in Erdman’s text VIIa is
                    printed in sequence, on the supposition that it represents Blake’s later
                    and more definitive thoughts on what should happen at this point in the poem,
                    while <pb id="p12-108" n="108"/> VIIb is printed as an appendix after Night IX.
                    The critical tradition which has grown up around the assumption that VIIa is a
                    later "version" of VIIb interprets Blake’s need to rewrite the
                    earlier Night as the symptom of an imaginative crisis, and thus looks to one or
                    both Nights for some definitive turning point in the growth of the poem and the
                    development of Blake’s vision. Frye, for instance, associates the textual
                    problem with Blake’s invention of the Spectre of Urthona: "The
                    conception of the Spectre of Urthona seems to have broken on Blake quite
                    suddenly when he was proceeding to a simpler climax, and occasioned the
                    rewriting of Night VII . . . . Eventually it burst the whole Zoa scheme
                    altogether, and was one of the chief reasons for abandoning the poem."<ref target="n47" type="note">5</ref><note id="n47"><hi rend="s">5</hi> Northrop Frye, <hi rend="i">Fearful
                            Symmetry</hi> (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1947), p.
                    298.</note></p>
        <p>This account of the poem’s growth sounds persuasive, but more recent
                    scholarship has severely questioned the assumption on which it is based, namely
                    that VIIb preceded VIIa. Wagenknecht describes the emergence of the alternative
                    view of the problem: <q> In 1956 . . . H. M. Margoliouth, in his edition of <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> . . . reminded scholars that, except for obviously
                        late additions, the narrative of VIIa flows continuously into VIIb. This
                        fact of course hinted that the long-held assumption that VIIb was composed
                        prior to VIIa needed to be reexamined, as did the idea fostered by received
                        opinion that the two versions were somehow thematically opposed to each
                        other. . . . Margoliouth’s hint was developed into a death knell for
                        received opinion by G. E. Bentley’s facsimile edition of the poem,
                        which demonstrated conclusively on the basis of stitch marks on the
                        manuscript that VIIb—as VIII and IX—had to be considered later
                        than VIIa.<ref target="n48" type="note">6</ref><note id="n48"><hi rend="s">6</hi> Wagenknecht, p. 226.</note></q> The implication here is that the two Nights were never alternate
                    "versions" at all, but simply two Nights written in sequence, with
                    VIIa coming first; and that Blake gave both of them the number seven because,
                    when he came to transcribe VIIb, he realized that he needed more than three
                    Nights to finish his poem, and so must fit I-VIIa into six Nights.<ref target="n49" type="note">7</ref> In other words, VIIb was originally
                    intended as part or all of a Night VIII, but had to be changed into a Night VII;
                    the original Night VII, i.e. VIIa, had to be squeezed back into the preceding
                    Nights. <note id="n49"><hi rend="s">7</hi> See H. M. Margoliouth, ed., <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Vala: Blake’s Numbered Text</hi>
                        (Oxford: Clarendon, 1956), p. xiii. Cf. Bentley, p. 163, cols.
                    1-2.</note></p>
        <p>It should be noted, however, that Erdman does not find Bentley’s dating of
                    VIIb conclusive at all,<ref target="n50" type="note">8</ref> but argues that
                    Blake may have omitted it from the stitched grouping of Nights III-VIIa, not
                    because it was later (i.e., as yet unwritten), but because Blake had already
                    replaced it by the time he bound up the other Nights. This is not impossible,
                    but the hypothesis by itself is not more convincing than Bentley’s
                    simpler assumption that all of the unstitched Nights (VIIb, VIII, and IX) are
                    later than VIIa, and it fails to account either for the narrative continuity of
                    VIIa-VIIb, or for the use in VIIb of symbolic names which crept into the poem
                    only at a late stage of revision (Bentley, 171 col. 2). <note id="n50"><hi rend="s">8</hi> Nor, apparently, does W. H. Stevenson, editor of the
                            Longman’s Annotated Edition of <hi rend="i">The Poems of William
                                Blake</hi> (London, 1971). On p. 371 Stevenson asserts that VIIb
                            "as a whole was undoubtedly written earlier . . . [and] rejected by
                            Blake." But I find Stevenson’s overall position rather
                            confusing and equivocal. If he believes that VIIb was
                            "undoubtedly" written earlier and rejected, why does he print
                            the text VIIa-VIIb, and indicate in his notes (371) that "a
                            continuity in the narrative" justifies this order? This treatment
                            of the text corresponds to the view that VIIb is neither earlier nor
                            rejected; and Stevenson hardly clarifies matters by remarking that
                            "the first part of VIIa . . . appears to belong to the same date as
                            VIIb" (371). My suspicion is that Stevenson really subscribes to
                            essentially the view I give—that the Nights were originally
                            written VIIa-VIIb, with the present ending of VIIa coming
                            later—but has preferred to avoid controversy by not saying so in
                            unmistakably clear terms.
                        <p>Alicia Ostriker sides with Erdman in <hi rend="i">William Blake: The
                                Complete Poems</hi> (New York: Penguin, 1977), p.
                    945.</p></note></p>
        <p>In short, though no really definitive evidence is available, it seems fairly
                    clear that VIIa was composed before VIIb. Composed, that is, <hi rend="i">in
                        some form</hi>: for the conclusion does not apply to the last three leaves
                    of VIIa, which are unstitched and contain "obviously late additions"
                    to the original Night (we will consider the significance of this fact in a
                    moment). Margoliouth’s demonstration of the original narrative continuity
                    of VIIa-VIIb remains the most important piece of evidence supporting the newer
                    theory of the Nights seven, so it is worth glancing at this juncture in the text
                    of his <hi rend="i">Vala</hi>: <q> . . . the immortal shadow shuddering<lb/>

                    Vala, whom the Spectre then sets as a guard over Orc. At the original beginning
                    of VIIb, Vala obediently stands on guard duty, and then embraces Orc, much as in
                    the <hi rend="i">Preludium</hi> to America. In default of more conclusive
                    evidence, the continuity of the narrative is a persuasive demonstration that at
                    an early stage of the poem’s development VIIa came first and VIIb second.
                    The argument can be reinforced by other, similar observations. In VIIa Urizen,
                    arriving in the Caves of Orc after his journey through chaos, "took his
                    seat upon a rock" (77:18); in VIIb we find him still seated there (95:16).
                    In VIIa Urizen proceeds to create the precondition of war by enslaving Orc (for
                    "War is Energy enslav’d"); in VIIb there is war. In VIIa
                    Enitharmon tells the Spectre of her fear that Orc may rend her "to the
                    winds of heaven" (82:38) and her hope that he will rend Vala instead
                    (83:34); in VIIb Orc does rend Vala (93:21), and Enitharmon’s fear for
                    herself reaches a climax in her "Watchman" speech (97:28ff.).
                    Likewise, early in VIIa (78:4), Blake describes the Tree of Mystery in a way
                    which strongly suggests that he is using the symbol for the first time; there
                    have been no previous references in Nights I-VI, and the more cryptic allusions
                    to <pb id="p12-109" n="109"/> the Tree in VIIb seem to presuppose the passage in
                    VIIa.</p>
        <p>This evidence of an original VIIa-VIIb order is further strengthened by the fact
                    that Night VI is continuous with VIIa but not VIIb. Placed at the end of VI,
                    either the original or the revised version of VIIb would produce a bewildering
                    non sequitur. By contrast, VI-VIIa is a clear sequence. Night VI ends with a
                    confrontation between Urizen, Tharmas, and the Spectre of Urthona; VIIa begins,
                    "Then Urizen arose the Spectre fled &amp; Tharmas fled." It is rather
                    hard to doubt that Blake conceived and wrote this transition all at once.</p>
        <p>Again, the attempt to think of VIIa as a "replacement" for VIIb becomes
                    very difficult when one notices how greatly the two differ in content. There is
                    virtually nothing in either the original or the added passages of VIIb to
                    indicate that the Night was an early model of VIIa. Given Blake’s usual
                    habits of composition, the traditional account of the two Nights would lead us
                    to expect an exceedingly complex entanglement of VIIa and VIIb, or perhaps a
                    single palimpsest. Instead, we have two clearly separate Nights, involving
                    largely different events and characters.</p>
        <p>Clearly, then, we ought to abandon the idea that VIIa was originally written to
                    replace an earlier VIIb, an idea which no substantive comparison of the two
                    Nights will support. But this is far from being the end of the story, for Blake
                    made major changes in both Nights as <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> turned into <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> To VIIa he added a few small passages and then
                    the long section of pp. 85-90, one of the crucial episodes of the present poem.
                    He appears to have made few major additions to VIIb, but he left three notes
                    directing that the first 153 lines be moved to the end, thus reversing the order
                    of the two main episodes of the Night (Erdman, 762). These revisions so
                    thoroughly undermine the original narrative continuity of VIIa-VIIb, and raise
                    such doubts concerning Blake’s ultimate intentions, that the editor of
                        <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> finds his basic problem still unsolved
                    despite the discovery of the <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> sequence. If the order of
                    the original Nights was clear enough, the order of the present Nights is not; it
                    is, in effect, a separate question.</p>
        <p>There is no real possibility of reading VIIb first and then VIIa; but once the
                    added passages of VIIa are taken into account, the opposite sequence becomes
                    equally unsatisfactory. It is clear enough why such critics as J. Middleton
                    Murry, Northrop Frye, and Harold Bloom, once persuaded that it was necessary to
                    choose between the two Nights, should be eager to believe that VIIa was the
                    later and authoritative version. For in the present VIIa we have not only the
                    great dramatic confrontation of Orc and Urizen, but the climactic <hi rend="i">rapprochement</hi> between Los, his Spectre, and Enitharmon. The latter
                    event in particular, which takes place entirely in the added passages, provides
                    a crucial link in Blake’s myth. Prior to VIIa, Los is a merely natural
                    imagination, a formidable but basically inhuman demiurge. He is often called a
                    "demon" and a "terror," and he has helped Urizen to enslave
                    Luvah and later Orc. Up to this point all his creations have been
                    semi-instinctive, <hi rend="i">ad hoc</hi> responses to the fallen state, and
                    the remainder of his energy has been spent in lovers’ quarrels with
                    Enitharmon. But the sequence of events which begins with the Spectre of
                    Urthona’s seduction of Enitharmon (84-86) works a profound change in Los.
                    By embracing Enitharmon, the Spectre gains the power to "enter Los’s
                    bosom," and then is embraced in his turn by Los, "first as a brother /
                    Then as another Self." Under the force of the Spectre’s
                    "inspired" persuasion, Los suddenly feels "A World within /
                    Opening its gates" and vows to "teach / Peace to the Soul of dark
                    revenge &amp; repentance to Cruelty." It is at this point that we hear,
                    for the very first time in all Blake’s works, of the necessity of
                    "Self-Annihilation"—henceforth one of Blake’s two or
                    three most important themes.<ref target="n51" type="note">9</ref> The new
                    alliance and new vision lead directly to the discovery of Los’s true
                    mission: he will progressively reconstruct the fallen Albion, first by weaving
                    "bodies" for the "Spectres of the Dead," then by creating
                    "forms sublime" which the spectres can assimilate into (87:36-39
                    &amp; 90:15-25). The Spectre of Urthona changes at this point from a
                    "ravning" Selfhood to a helpful "medium," and Enitharmon,
                    still more dramatically, from an aberrant Female Will into a loving source of
                    creative inspiration. Finally, in a fitting climax to these climaxes, the
                    three-way alliance manages to regenerate and redeem the fallen Urizen. <note id="n51"><hi rend="s">9</hi> Concordance, p. 1654.</note></p>
        <p>Thus the extraordinary added passages on pp. 85-90 point the way, not only to the
                    apocalypse of Night IX, but to the central myths and themes of Blake’s
                    two subsequent epics. Given the importance of the Los-Spectre relationship in
                        <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, and of the weaving of bodies in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, one gets the impression that in these pages of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> Blake achieved an imaginative breakthrough which
                    profoundly affected his conception of the later poems—unless, indeed, it
                    was his work on the later poems which showed him how to solve his problems with
                        <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> It is understandable, then, that critics
                    should find VIIa more faithful to the spirit of Blake’s mature vision
                    than VIIb, and should therefore be reluctant to surrender the traditional view
                    of the problem. The tendency can be observed in Harold Bloom’s discussion
                    of the Nights seven in the Erdman edition of Blake: <q> The two sections of
                        Night VII are alternate ways of preparing for the blackness of Night VIII
                        and the liberation of Night IX. I find it difficult to believe that VIIa is
                        not the later in composition, but in this belief I am guided only by what I
                        take to be internal evidence. Whichever was later, our understanding of the
                        poem’s total design can only benefit by a study of both versions. I
                        do not think it accurate (or fair to the poem) to read Nights VIIa and VIIb
                        as being an intentional sequence, in that order. VIIa in at least some
                        respects is an imaginative advance on VIIb.<lb/><lb/> (Erdman, 876) </q> One
                    cannot fault Bloom’s sense that VIIb makes an <pb id="p12-110" n="110"/>
                    unsatisfactory sequel to the present VIIa; for in VIIb we confront the old Los
                    again, a warrior Los with "his knees / Bathed in bloody clouds. his loins
                    in fires of war where spears / And swords rage . . . " (96:21).<ref target="n52" type="note">10</ref> Similarly, Tharmas, Orc, and Urizen, all
                    of whom have been partially rehabilitated in the triumphant reconciliations of
                    VIIa, reappear in VIIb, without explanation, in more primitive stages of fall.
                    As a sequel to the present VIIa, then, VIIb would give us at best a very sour
                    irony, sufficient to undercut the new ending of VIIa, and with it the
                    justification for the poem’s apocalyptic conclusion.<ref target="n53" type="note">11</ref><note id="n52"><hi rend="s">10</hi> Similarly, Stevenson notes that in VIIb,
                        "The regeneration of Los and Enitharmon is ignored," p. 389. Cf.
                        Margoliouth, p. 144, and Paley, p. 161.</note><note id="n53"><hi rend="s">11</hi> Of course Night VIII is a war Night too; but
                        here the battle scenes are matched in stirring counterpoint to scenes which
                        depict Los’s mighty efforts to resist the forces of fall, so that the
                        outlook is not nearly so bleak as in VIIb. On the whole, the tone of VIII
                        seems to me one of breathtaking suspense tending strongly toward
                        optimism.</note></p>
        <p>Moreover, the present VIIa tallies fairly well with Night VIII, while VIIb does
                    not. At the beginning of VIII we have a "Council of God"
                    passage—one of Blake’s favorite setpieces—and then Los and
                    Enitharmon in effect resume the conversation they have been having near the end
                    of VIIa: <q> Then Los said I behold the Divine Vision thro the broken Gates<lb/>
                        Of thy poor broken heart astonishd melted into Compassion &amp; Love<lb/>
                        And Enitharmon said I see the Lamb of God upon Mount Zion<lb/> Wondring with
                        love &amp; Awe they felt the divine hand upon them<lb/><lb/> (VIII, 99:15;
                        cf. VIIa, 86:44-60) </q> References to the apocalyptic mission quickly
                    follow, with Enitharmon once again "sighing forth" the spectres and
                    Los "recieving them into his hands" (99:23-100:2; cf. VIIa, 90:35-67).
                    Late additions throughout Night VIII continue to develop the same theme (cf. p.
                    113), supporting the conclusion that Blake was assuming the final version of
                    VIIa as the immediately preceding Night. One could, conceivably, make a similar
                    argument for the continuity of VIIb (in the revised sequence) and Night VIII, on
                    the basis that the spectres of the dead descend from Beulah at both 95:11 and
                    99:19. But the spectres also descend late in VIIa (85:18), and on the whole a
                    VIIb-VIII sequence would present an inexplicable shift from sardonic gloom to
                    prophetic hope. The Los and Enitharmon of VIII are unmistakably the prophetic
                    figures who emerge at the end of the revised VIIa; they have little in common
                    with the savage Los and hysterical Enitharmon of VIIb.<ref target="n54" type="note">12</ref><note id="n54"><hi rend="s">12</hi> Erdman, p. 758, offers a rather curious
                        argument to show that the two Nights were closely joined at a <hi rend="i">previous</hi> stage of composition. He theorizes that the marginal note
                        Blake left on page 100, calling for the insertion of a passage beginning
                        "Los stood" between 100:1 and 100:2, refers to most of page
                        90—i.e., basically to the present ending of VIIa—but that
                        Blake later changed his mind and left the passage on 90 in its present
                        position. His conclusion is that "this bit of masonry" (the
                        provisional insertion of 90 into 100) "which cements VIIa closely to
                        VIII, seems to indicate a time when Blake considered VIIb as abandoned (or
                        moved)." Wagenknecht reviews the argument on pp. 298-300; I agree with
                        his conclusion that Erdman’s theory about pages 90 and 100 is
                        "extremely suppositious . . . on the basis of physical evidence
                        alone," and also improbable for stylistic and thematic reasons. But
                        unless I misread, Erdman’s conclusion still stands, for the different
                        and much more obvious reason that VIIa in its present state is <hi rend="i">still</hi> "cemented closely" to VIII. Cf. Paley, p.
                        161.</note></p>
        <p>It seems, then, that at a late stage of revision Blake decided to route the poem
                    around VIIb. This means that the traditional account of the two Nights may not
                    be so far mistaken after all. Nothing says that Blake had to write VIIb first in
                    order to be dissatisfied with it, or VIIa second in order to prefer it if a
                    choice had to be made. It is quite possible that he first wrote both Nights (as
                    consecutive rather than alternate episodes), next started feeling that his
                    approach to apocalypse was unsatisfactory, and then saw that his best opening
                    for a more suitable approach could be found in the earlier VIIa. Once he had
                    made his changes in VIIa, he would have found that VIIb no longer fit as a
                    sequel; since at this point he had ten Nights anyway, he might then have decided
                    to keep VIIa as Night VII (reversing his earlier decision to squeeze it back
                    into I-VI), revising Night VIII accordingly. Thus VIIa, though not originally a
                    replacement for VIIb, would have become one by the time Blake finished his
                    revisions.</p>
        <p>This theory would seemingly allow us to go on reading VIIb in the way it has
                    usually been read—as an alternate but rejected approach to Night
                    VIII—if we stipulated that VIIb’s previous niche is presently
                    filled by the added section of VIIa alone, rather than by the Night as a whole.
                    Once again, however, matters cannot be so simple. Blake was not a poet to delete
                    material he liked if he thought he could possibly find a place for it, and the
                    very fact that he kept VIIb together with the rest of his manuscript testifies
                    to his hope that it could somehow be reintegrated into the poem. Moreover,
                    though VIIb seems to be excluded by the VI-VIIa-VIII sequence upon which Blake
                    finally settled, its disentanglement from the other Nights is incomplete. For
                    instance, the references to war in the added passages of VIIa come quite
                    abruptly; when Los draws Urizen "from out the ranks of war," it is
                    very difficult to tell just what war Blake is talking about.<ref target="n55" type="note">13</ref> Then on reflection one has to conclude that it is the
                    war described in VIIb. Of course the poem’s tendency to subvert linear
                    chronology should never be underestimated, and it is just possible that we are
                    dealing with a proleptic reference to the wars of Night VIII. Still, on the
                    whole the climactic turn toward peace, mercy, and art at the end of VIIa seems
                    more comprehensible if played against the backdrop of Orc’s violent
                    rising in VIIb. It is as if Blake, once having written VIIb, could not wholly
                    refrain from assuming it as a basis for his revisions to VIIa, or as if he
                    worked with the intention of later transplanting parts of VIIb into VIIa. <note id="n55"><hi rend="s">13</hi> There are four previous references to war in
                        VIIa, but these are brief and casual. Concordance, p. 2069.</note></p>
        <p>Wagenknecht offers a substantial demonstration of VIIb’s importance to
                    Blake’s overall argument (225ff.), and shows that Night VIII contains
                    back-references to VIIb as well as VIIa; his conclusion is that Blake left
                    "two integral, not alternative, Nights VII." If Blake had suppressed
                    VIIb, perhaps no one would ever have noticed that it was missing; with the Night
                    before us, however, we see many things that the poem as a whole seems to need.
                    The very dramatic meeting between Tharmas and Vala brings Tharmas up to
                    date—he has been rather scarce since Night IV—and prepares for his
                    next appearance, in VIII. The emergence of Vala herself as a fully distinct
                    character obviously provides a crucial continuation to the story of her birth in
                    VIIa, and a prelude to her appearance as Rahab in the apocalypse. In some ways
                    her epiphany is redone in Night VIII, yet the later treatment is less full, and
                    can be better understood by the light of the earlier one.<ref target="n56" type="note">14</ref> For instance, the descent of the spectres,
                    "tempted by the Shadowy females sweet / Delusive cruelty" (VIII,
                    99:20), makes more sense if one has first read the exquisite description of
                    Vala’s beauty which Blake provides in VIIb. <note id="n56"><hi rend="s">14</hi> Cf. especially 101:20ff: <q> . . . While the dark

                            original beginning of VIIb—yet again. This could mean that Blake
                            was thinking of VIIb as abandoned, and was trying to sketch in one
                            portion of its contents which he considered vital. On the other hand,
                            the passage is brief enough to have been intended as a refrain or echo,
                            so it is equally possible that Balke was still committed to including
                            VIIb.
                    </note></p>
        <p>In sum, we have to regard VIIb as part of the poem, but there is no really
                    satisfactory way to fit it in. Blake left the Night as a unit, but as a unit it
                    resists placement anywhere in the present <pb id="p12-111" n="111"/> text. It
                    seems that VIIb was originally designed to carry the poem all the way from the
                    birth of Vala to the brink of apocalypse—albeit a simpler apocalypse than
                    the one Blake finally imagined—and it has a cataclysmic finality which
                    makes it seem to belong—somewhere—late in the present Night
                        VIII.<ref target="n57" type="note">15</ref> Yet its general pessimism and
                    the unregenerate state of its protagonists make VIIb seem to fit best into the
                    juncture between the old and new portions of VIIa, where it originally began. No
                    doubt this is the least unsatisfactory niche; still, VIIb rises to a climax of
                    its own which would throw the alternate climax of the revised VIIa off center.
                    In VIIb the apocalypse seems imminent; in VIIa it is not to come for another six
                    thousand years (87:26). In VIIb Tharmas and Vala seem destined to be key figures
                    in bringing about the final consummation; in VIIa they are supernumeraries.
                    Moreover, if restored to its original position, VIIb would interrupt the story
                    of Los’s reconciliation with his Spectre and Emanation, spoiling the
                    narrative rhythm of VIIa. It is certain that Blake himself, once he had
                    conceived of the regeneration of Los, preferred to avoid such interruption and
                    to pursue the narrative of VIIa directly to its present climax. <note id="n57"><hi rend="s">15</hi> In Margoliouth’s <hi rend="i">Vala</hi>,
                        the ending of VIIb in its original order is joined directly to the original
                        beginning of IX—so that VIIb is in effect the Night VIII of <hi rend="i">Vala.</hi> I do not find this arrangement of the text quite
                        persuasive, even as representing an earlier state of the manuscript, but I
                        do agree with Margoliouth’s general sense (and with Bentley’s)
                        that the material of VIIb was originally conceived as part of the last Night
                        before the apocalypse. It is mainly the emphasis on climactic war (a
                        "signal of the dawn" for which Blake had the authority of <hi rend="i">Revelation</hi>) which persuades me of this. But by the time
                        Blake made the present transcript of VIIb, with the heading "Night the
                        Seventh," another Night VIII must have existed.</note></p>
        <p>The puzzle grows still more perplexing when one tries to grasp Blake’s
                    reasons for changing the order of VIIb. It seems logical to suppose that the
                    change would have come after Blake had written the new ending of VIIa, since the
                    original continuity of VIIa-VIIb would already have been lost. If at this point
                    Blake was toying with the idea of a VIIa-VIIb-VIII sequence, the switch would
                    have the advantage of moving the descent of the spectres to the end, creating a
                    bridge between VIIb and VIII. Yet the corresponding transition from the new
                    ending of VIIa to the new beginning of VIIb seems quite wayward. At the end of
                    VIIa Urizen is an infant in Los’s arms; the reordered VIIb begins,
                    "But in the deeps beneath the Roots of Mystery in darkest night / Where
                    Urizen sat on his rock the Shadow brooded / Urizen saw &amp; triumphd &amp; he
                    cried to his warriors." Of course, this is just enough of a non sequitur to
                    be possibly intentional—especially since Blake has noted at the end of
                    VIIa that Los was able to redeem all of Urizen <hi rend="i">except</hi>
                    "his Spectrous form which could not be drawn away" (90:60). The lines
                    take us back to that troublesome crossroads in the narrative, Vala’s
                    birth from the Shadow of Enitharmon, and it is this event rather than
                    Los’s regeneration—or this event together with a misconception of
                    what has happened to Los—which causes Urizen to triumph.<ref target="n58" type="note">16</ref> It seems just conceivable that Blake was trying to
                    rearrange VIIb in such a way that, having traced the consequences of the
                    Enitharmon-Spectre union in the upper world of Los, the narrative now backtracks
                    and begins to trace the consequences of the union in the lower world of the
                    spectrous Urizen. Yet such a change, supposing that Blake once intended it,
                    would do nothing to solve the weightier problems involved in a VIIa-VIIb
                    sequence, leaving us with an inexplicable contrast between prophetic hope and
                    ironic despair. <note id="n58"><hi rend="s">16</hi> Vala was originally
                        mentioned in the third as well as the first line of the passage, which read
                        "Urizen cried to the Shadowy Female" rather than "Urizen
                        cried to his warriors." The change, however, does not affect the fact
                        that Urizen is gloating over the birth of Vala: it merely means that his
                        speech is now directed to his warriors rather than her. An additional,
                        deleted line on the same page reads, "The shadowy voice answerd O
                        Urizen Prince of Light," showing that Blake at one time conceived of
                        Urizen’s speech as part of a conversation between Urizen and Vala.
                        Since no other trace of Vala’s half of the conversation remains here
                        (it has conceivably been moved to VIII, 102:28 ff.), it seems probable that
                        the change in the third line came quite early, before the reordering of the
                        Night.</note></p>
        <p>The other possible explanation, to which I tentatively incline, is that Blake
                    changed the order of VIIb before writing the new ending to VIIa. On this
                    hypothesis, the change would be the first expression of Blake’s
                    dissatisfaction with the <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> sequence, and the first sign of
                    his search for a more humanistic approach to apocalypse. The advantage of the
                    new order is in moving the confrontation of Tharmas and Vala—which,
                    though gloomy enough, is at least more hopeful than the frantic violence which
                    dominates the other portion of the Night—to the end.<ref target="n59" type="note">17</ref> The idea is supported by Blake’s late addition,
                    at 94:12, of a lament for Luvah which makes the portrait of Vala considerably
                    more sympathetic. Moreover, the reversed VIIb would still be fairly continuous
                    with the original VIIa (though less so than formerly), since the revised
                    beginning returns to the moment of Vala’s birth. But if the reordering of
                    VIIb did in fact occur at a fairly early stage, it probably corresponded to a
                    plan of revision which Blake abandoned when he decided to merge Los and the
                    Spectre. At whatever point it was executed, the flip-flopping of the Night was a
                    mechanical tactic, incapable by itself of solving any of the serious problems
                    confronting Blake. His failure to change the numbering of the Nights seven is,
                    by itself, sufficient evidence that he was never finally satisfied to place VIIb
                    between VIIa and VIII. <note id="n59"><hi rend="s">17</hi> Stevenson, p. 390,
                        gives the opposite opinion: "In the second half (as it now is) Orc
                        appears. In transferring this passage to the end, Blake has delayed till
                        last the revelation of the worst evil."</note></p>
        <p>Still, it is not difficult to arrive at a general sense of Night VIIb’s
                    place in Blake’s vision, even though it is impossible to find a physical
                    place for it in the text of his poem. In effect, Blake’s narrative
                    separates into parallel strands when Vala is born from the Shadow of Enitharmon,
                    at the point of the original ending of VIIa. Frye’s account of this
                    doubling refers only to the present VIIa, but seems valid even if applied to
                    both Nights seven: "In Night VII [i.e., VIIa] . . . a double crisis takes
                    place, one an imaginative advance, symbolized by the mingling of Los and the
                    Spectre of Urthona, the other a consolidation of error symbolized by the birth
                    of Rahab [i.e., Vala] from the Spectre of Urthona and . . . the Shadow of
                    Enitharmon" (Frye, 278). Roughly speaking, the path of "consolidation
                    of error" leads through VIIb, with its emphasis on climactic war, the
                    catastrophic rising of Orc, the triumph of Urizen, the epiphany of Vala, and the
                    inconsolable rage of Tharmas; the path of "imaginative advance" leads
                    through the added passages of VIIa, where for the first time we find a fully
                    prophetic Los, aided by his Spectre and Emanation, struggling to save mankind
                    through creative action. The two strands come back together again in VIII
                    (though with some fairly messy duplication of VIIb), where a sense of breakneck
                    progress toward apocalypse is brilliantly captured in the counterpointing of
                    Los’s furious acts of creation and Urizen-Satan-Rahab’s equally
                    furious acts of subversion and destruction.</p>
        <p>Likewise, though no exact chronology of the composition of these Nights can be
                    given, it is possible to speak with reasonable assurance about the process of
                    imaginative growth which must have been involved. At an early stage, it would
                    seem, Blake conceived of an apocalypse motivated almost exclusively by the
                    "consolidation of error," a mechanical apocalypse entailing an almost
                    instantaneous leap from nadir to zenith. What this vision lacked was <pb id="p12-112" n="112"/> the myth of the fully human and self-conscious Los,
                    and thus any sense of the possibility for positive human action in the fallen
                    world. Possibly Blake was astonished at the oversight once he recognized it;
                    possibly he came to regard <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> as categorically superior to <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>
                    because in those poems the mature Los, the self-conscious visionary confronting
                    human problems on the stage of human history, is dominant throughout, whereas
                    the far-ranging fantasy of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> deals largely with a
                    sort of cosmic pre-history.</p>
        <p>In any case, the new ending to VIIa marks a decisive change in Blake’s
                    concepts of apocalypse and prophecy. By mingling Los and the Spectre Blake
                    creates a human agency capable of turning fallen history in the direction of a
                    Last Judgement, thus transforming the apocalypse into a quest story with the
                    poet-prophet as its unequivocal hero. It was a change which strained the
                    narrative structure of the epic to the breaking point, squeezing VIIb halfway
                    out of the poem and causing major revisions in Night VIII. Yet the new vision
                    does not really invalidate the old; rather, as a later stage in a dialectic, it
                    necessarily implies and incorporates the earlier stages. The essential coherence
                    of the structure which Blake finally left—VIIa, VIII, and IX, with VIIb
                    lounging somewhere in the shadows—is not diminished by the fact that it
                    presumably grew out of a poetic process whose beginning did not know its
                    end.</p>
        <p>Why, then, did Blake lack the stamina to make a final disposition of VIIb, if
                    indeed that was all he had to do in order to finish his poem? The question is
                    especially troubling in that Blake apparently had a logical moment at which to
                    attempt the reintegration of the displaced Night when he revised Night VIII to
                    bring it into line with the new VIIa. It would seem more natural to bring in
                    passages from VIIb at this point than to plan on yet another revision of VIII
                    later on. On the other hand, one can imagine that Blake would find the problem
                    of VIIb an unwelcome distraction from the new vision which absorbed him as he
                    reworked Night VIII. Moreover, he might have been rather slow to part with the
                    idea that VIIb could be retained as a unit. <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> is,
                    finally, a story, yet its narrative structure is formed by the spatial accretion
                    of alternate myths and symbols around a central core of events (Fall,
                    Incarnation, Redemption, Apocalypse) which they interpret and exemplify, as well
                    as by the linear unfolding of the plot. It may have taken Blake some time to
                    decide that the clash of the old VIIb with the new VIIa and VIII was a greater
                    incongruity than even this structure could tolerate.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the recognition of VIIb’s incompatibility eventually came,
                    and one still must wonder why Blake never solved the problem. The speculation
                    which suggests itself, supposing that we have guessed right up till now, is that
                    the new inspiration proved all too potent. It drew Blake’s energies away
                    from <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> toward <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, but persuaded him more and more that further
                    revisions of the earlier poem were necessary, or at least desirable. Night VIII
                    in particular makes extensive use of the symbolic "Machinery" of the
                    later epics, in a way that sometimes justifies Margoliouth’s remark that
                    "Blake abandoned the poem because the new wine was bursting the old
                        bottles."<ref target="n60" type="note">18</ref> It is as if Blake could
                    not content himself with completing <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> as such, but
                    had to go on to attempt a wholesale demonstration of the poem’s
                    consistency with its offspring; as if, after a certain point, everything had to
                    be said over again from the stand-point of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> Nights I
                    and II contain certain late additions which suggest that Blake may have decided
                    to work through his first six Nights yet again, installing passages which would
                    anticipate the new vision, before tackling the problem of VIIb. Yet at the same
                    time, judging by the virtually atemporal structures of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>
                    and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Blake was undergoing a crisis of disenchantment
                    with narrative itself. In <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> he seems completely
                    unwilling to impose anything resembling a narrative chronology on the actions
                    and events of his myth. As he grew more and more accustomed to letting spatial
                    principles of symbolic association prevail over "clock-time," Blake no
                    doubt found himself less and less inspired to resolve the narrative tangles of
                    the Nights seven. <note id="n60"><hi rend="s">18</hi><hi rend="i"> William Blake</hi> (London: Oxford Univ. Press, 1951), p.
                        115.</note></p>
        <p>How, then, should the two Nights be presented to the reader? My not very
                    earthshaking conclusion is that K in this particular is superior to E. VIIb
                    should come after VIIa, but is too important to the poem to be treated as an
                    appendix. Both editions are undoubtedly correct in presenting each Night as a
                    unit, rather than attempting to reintegrate VIIb into VIIa or VIII or both, for
                    such an attempt would be highly presumptuous, and would obscure a problem it
                    could not solve. Likewise, it seems best to print VIIb in the revised order, a
                    step which is dictated by the general policy of following the latest intentions
                    for which there is direct evidence in the manuscript.</p>
        <p>Whether the critic should be bound by this arrangement of the Nights is another
                    question, or perhaps no question at all, since the critic is always at liberty
                    to choose the order of the passages which he wishes to discuss. But for the
                    purpose of a linear commentary, or of having a theoretical model of the
                    poem’s narrative sequence, I would recommend a critical order much like
                    the one Wagenknecht uses in his reading of the poem.<ref target="n61" type="note">19</ref> Having read VIIa up to the point of Vala’s birth
                    from the Shadow of Enitharmon, I would then take up VIIb, considering it in its
                    original position in order to get a coherent view of Blake’s first
                    attempt to depict approaching apocalypse. I would choose the original rather
                    than the revised version of VIIb (though with some hesitation), for the sake of
                    preserving the original continuity of VIIa-VIIb, and because I suspect that the
                    reordering of the Night corresponded to a plan of revision which Blake never
                    carried out. Having read VIIb straight through in this order, I would return to
                    the added passages of VIIa; then on to VIII and IX. I do not, of course, claim
                    that this ordering of the text would have any authority; it is merely a sequence
                    for which there is some scholarly justification, and one which would be useful
                    for some critical purposes. <note id="n61"><hi rend="s">19</hi> See <hi rend="i">Blake’s Night</hi>, pp. 224-25.</note></p>

        <p>The presence of two Nights headed "Night the Seventh" in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> forces editorial choice of an uncomfortable kind. If we
                    decide to exclude one we will exclude material which seems necessary for a full
                    understanding of the poem. If both are included, how should we read them? We
                    seem to be left with a narrative which is hopelessly confused. In this article I
                    want first to analyze in detail some of the stages in the poem’s
                    development, and then to suggest a textual arrangement which will allow the two
                    Nights to be read as a single and reasonably coherent narrative.<ref target="n62" type="note">1</ref><note id="n62"><hi rend="s">1</hi> All references to <hi rend="i">The Four

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>By considering VIIa (pages 77-90) as a single homogeneous narrative, Sloss
                        and Wallis helped to establish the critical tradition which has regarded
                        this Night as later than VIIb (pages 91-98). They asserted that
                        "Enitharmon’s fear of punishment and utter extinction . . . and
                        Los’s creation of Bodies from the Spectres" were described
                        "in the main body of the text,"<ref target="n63" type="note">2</ref> whereas they are clearly described in a subsequent addition to
                        the main body of the Night, introduced after two previous Night endings (at
                        85:22 and 85:31). In order to have a meaningful basis for the discussion of
                        relative dates, we must first try to distinguish the original form of VIIa
                        from the subsequent additions. <note id="n63"><hi rend="s">2</hi> D. J.
                            Sloss and J. P. R. Wallis, eds., <hi rend="i">The Prophetic Writings of
                                William Blake</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon, 1926), I, 138.</note></p>
          <p>The first four leaves of VIIa, pages 77-84, have stitch marks which indicate
                        that they were once bound together with pages 43-76 and 111-12. The presence
                        of stitch marks on pages 111-12 suggests that this leaf was not originally
                        designed for its present context in VIII (the rest of which was never bound)
                        but had some other place in the manuscript. Bentley suggests<ref target="n64" type="note">3</ref> that the leaf, which has a full-page
                        sketch on page 112, was bound at the end of IV when Blake added the
                        pencilled instruction "Bring in here the Globe of Blood as in the B of
                        Urizen" between lines 17 and 18 on page 55. Bentley argues that the
                        drawing (showing a male looking anxiously at a female howling in horror, the
                        female trying to break away from the male’s embrace) was intended to
                        illustrate the lines which follow the Globe of Blood passage in <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi>: <q> But Los saw the Female &amp; pitied<lb/> He
                            embrac’d her, she wept, she refus’d<lb/> In perverse and
                            cruel delight<lb/> She fled from his arms, yet he followd.<lb/><lb/>
                                (<hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> VI, 1) </q><note id="n64"><hi rend="s">3</hi> Bentley, p. 200.</note></p>
          <p>Bentley concludes that the leaf was added after Blake had covered page 56
                        (originally left blank) with additions; but the two sets of additions which
                        cover the page contain Christian symbolism of a fairly developed kind, and
                        so Bentley’s suggestion implies that the binding which once held
                        pages 43-84 and 111-12 was made after Blake had begun to introduce Christian
                        material into the poem. As no other page containing Christian symbolism in
                        the basic text shows any sign of stitch marks, this seems unlikely.</p>
          <p>As there is no apparent connection between the drawing on page 112 and
                        anything else at the end of IV, the leaf may have been designed for some
                        other context within the binding that once held pages 43-84. Although only
                        the first four leaves of VIIa were bound (pages 77-84), there is no Night
                        ending on page 84, and the first ending now occurs after line 21 on the
                        unbound page 85. Bentley comments: "Assuming that the Night was
                        complete when bound, [Blake] later found it necessary to alter the last <pb id="p12-116" n="116"/> leaf so much that the whole leaf had to be
                        removed and a new one substituted."<ref target="n65" type="note">4</ref> This rests on the assumption that the Night was complete when
                        bound, which is open to question. The first Night ending on page 85 comes
                        after the description of Vala’s rebirth; and page 86 has a full-page
                        drawing of a female figure who is probably Vala, which may have been
                        intended to illustrate the Night ending. With this leaf VIIa would have nine
                        pages of text plus a full-page drawing, in line with the pattern Blake had
                        established in III, V, and VI, and which he probably intended for IV. As we
                        have seen, it is unlikely that the leaf containing pages 111-12 was bound at
                        the end of IV. It seems more likely, in view of the drawing on page 112,
                        that the leaf was originally designed for the end of VIIa. The relationship
                        between the Spectre of Urthona and the Spirit of Enitharmon described on
                        pages 82-84 follows the pattern typical of Los and Enitharmon, the male
                        tortured by jealousy, the female scornful and elusive: <q> He turned from
                            side to side in tears he wept &amp; he embracd<lb/> The fleeting image
                            &amp; in whispers mild wood the faint shade.<lb/><lb/> (82:26-27) </q><note id="n65"><hi rend="s">4</hi> Bentley, p. 162.</note></p>
          <p>The drawing on page 112 would have been very suitable for VIIa if the Night
                        had ended with the tension between the Spectre and Shadow still unresolved.
                        When Blake bound the leaf with pages 43-84, that may have been his
                        intention; but in transcribing VIIa he may have begun to feel that
                        Vala’s birth would make a better climax (deciding, perhaps, to
                        transfer it from the beginning of the eighth Night?). In that case he would
                        naturally unbind his manuscript to remove pages 111-12; and he would also
                        prepare a new sheet which would be exactly like pages 85-86 before the
                        additions. When it was unbound page 111 was almost certainly still blank,
                        and it was only written on when Blake decided to use it in VIII. In this
                        case, then, Blake seems to have bound a leaf and prepared it with a drawing
                            <hi rend="i">before</hi> anything had been written on it: a surprising
                        instance which calls into question the assumption that the stitch marks were
                        made after Blake had completed, or partially completed, a draft of the poem.
                        This also suggests that the basic text of page 85 may have been the first
                        ending of VIIa to be transcribed on proof pages, and that it may be regarded
                        as the original end of VIIa. I shall subsequently refer to the basic text of
                        pages 77-85 (ending with 85:22) as "VIIa1," and to the added
                        material (85:23-90:68) as "VIIa2."</p>
          <p>Night VIIa1 contains little that could be regarded as "late" in
                        relation to pages 43-76. The Shadow of Enitharmon is a new figure, but she
                        enters the poem through the same kind of division that produced the Spectre,
                        and her appearance is a natural development in the disintegration of Urthona
                        rather than a late development in Blake’s symbolism. There are
                        references to Beulah in the Shadow’s account of the fall on page 83,
                        but Beulah is also mentioned in the Spectre’s account of the fall on
                        page 50 in IV. Night VIIa1 has strong narrative links with pages 43-76, as
                        it describes the confrontation between Urizen and Orc (anticipated at the
                        end of VI), and the rebirth of Vala (anticipated in V). Taken together, the
                        narrative of pages 43-85 follows the narrative sequence of <hi rend="i">Urizen-Ahania</hi> (the active confrontation between Urizen and Fuzon
                        becomes a verbal confrontation between Urizen and Orc, but at the end of
                        both the defeated energy principle is forced to ascend the tree of
                        Mystery).</p>
          <p>As Erdman points out in his review of Bentley’s edition of the
                        facsimile, stitch marks alone are of little help in questions of relative
                            date.<ref target="n66" type="note">5</ref> Leaves without stitch marks
                        could have been superseded and removed before Blake bound the manuscript, or
                        they could have been added afterwards. Nor can we be sure at what stage in
                        the process of composition the manuscript was bound. So we must rely on
                        internal evidence: the coherence of the narrative may be indicative, and the
                        date of transcription will be suggested by the latest reference in the basic
                        text. <note id="n66"><hi rend="s">5</hi> David V. Erdman, "The Binding
                                (<hi rend="i">et cetera</hi>) of <hi rend="i">Vala</hi>," <hi rend="i">The Library</hi>, 5th Ser., XIX (1964), 121-22.</note></p>
          <p>In VIIb there is material which clearly seems to be later than anything in
                        the basic text of pages 43-76 or VIIa1, namely lines 4-14 on page 95, which
                        describe the Daughters of Beulah "Waiting with Patience for the
                        fulfilment of the Promise Divine," and which conclude with the
                        appearance of Satan. Once again, the relevance of these lines was obscured
                        by Sloss and Wallis, who reported that they were "written over a
                        previous draft, deleted,"<ref target="n67" type="note">6</ref> whereas
                        they are clearly part of the basic text. The "Promise" of these
                        lines is a reference to the story of Lazarus in John 11. Similar references
                        occur only in recognizably late additions to the poem, on the added page 21
                        (lines 9-10) and in an added passage on page 56 (line 1). Satan also appears
                        only in late passages, as on the added page 22 (line 4), in the added
                        passage on page 56 (line 19), and in the manifestly late eighth Night. <note id="n67"><hi rend="s">6</hi> Sloss and Wallis, I, 337.</note></p>
          <p>This evidence alone suggests that VIIb is later than VIIa1, but there is also
                        the fact that VIIb has stronger narrative links with VIIa1 than it has with
                        VI. The growth of the tree of Mystery, Orc climbing the tree, and
                        Vala’s birth are all described in VIIa1, and yet all are assumed in
                        VIIb; and the original beginning of VIIb (on page 91 before the narrative
                        was rearranged) seems to follow from the end of VIIa1. Bentley suggests that
                        Blake revised and expanded the eighth Night, rewriting it as two Nights, one
                        of which was VIIb;<ref target="n68" type="note">7</ref> this suggestion
                        merits further consideration, for if VIIb does contain material which was
                        displaced from the eighth Night we would expect to find some evidence of
                        this displacement. I believe such evidence does exist. <note id="n68"><hi rend="s">7</hi> Bentley, pp. 162-63.</note></p>
          <p>In the Lambeth books Blake had developed two different images for the
                        corruption of Orc: in <hi rend="i">Ahania</hi> crucifixion, and in the
                        Preludium of <hi rend="i">America</hi> the embrace with the Shadowy female,
                        whose possessive reaction suggests that she may simply absorb Orc’s
                        energies. In VIIa1 Blake reconciles the two images. The Spectre draws Vala
                        to embrace Orc who is stretched on the Tree of Mystery. An elaborate
                        parallel to the Preludium of <hi rend="i">America</hi> begins with the <pb id="p12-117" n="117"/><figure><head><hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, p. 86.</head></figure><pb id="p12-118" n="118"/> daughters of Urizen feeding Orc (79:26-28).
                        Orc’s transformation into a jewelled serpent recalls not only
                        Fuzon’s corruption on the tree, but also Orc’s growth into
                        maturity. Vala is born as a spreading cloud at the end of VIIal, and in the
                        first lines of VIIb she stands before Orc (91:1-2). Directly after these
                        lines in VIIb, Orc breaks free from his bondage and is embraced by Vala
                        "that he might lose his rage" (91:4). The embrace completes the
                        transformation of Orc: "his human form consumd in his own fires"
                        (93:21) until "No more remaind of Orc but the Serpent round the tree of
                        Mystery" (93:24). Vala herself is strewn on the abyss. The
                        confrontation of Vala and Orc is resolved, then, near the beginning of VIIb.
                        However, there is a passage in VIII (101:10-25) which should, logically,
                        precede this embrace. In this passage Orc is still in bondage, and his
                        transformation into a jewelled serpent is still not complete—he is
                        still "raging," his form is still partially "human." The
                        passage brings us to a point equivalent to the third line of the <hi rend="i">America</hi> Preludium, and it is at this point that we might
                        expect a description of the embrace in which Orc breaks from bondage and
                        loses his human form completely.</p>
          <p>There is evidence of similar displacements elsewhere in VIIb. Urizen’s
                        triumphant proclamation at 95:15-24 was addressed to the Shadowy female in
                        the basic text, and followed by a line which was immediately deleted:
                        "The shadowy voice answerd O Urizen Prince of Light." The speech
                        that was to have followed here was omitted, but perhaps it is worth pointing
                        out that Vala addresses Urizen only twice in the rest of the poem, once at
                        31:4-16 and once in VIII (102:28-103:20) in a speech which begins, as above,
                        "O Urizen Prince of Light." It seems possible that the speech in
                        VIII was once intended as a reply to Urizen’s proclamation. Blake
                        must have been editing the text from which he was copying when he
                        transcribed VIIb. After 96:18 half a line was deleted: "Urizen namd it
                        Pande," which suggests that Blake was cutting short a longer passage
                        here. He introduced instead, rather abruptly, the passage 96:20-98:31, which
                        may have originally had a different context.</p>
          <p>Urizen’s proclamation is followed by a description of his
                        preparations—the construction of a slave-based economy and the
                        erection of a temple of secret religion. More of these preparations are
                        described in passages which now appear in VIII, and these passages seem to
                        be leading up to an apocalyptic confrontation like the one described in
                        96:20-98:31. In the passage 100:27-32 Urizen begins to manufacture the
                        machinery of warfare, the object of this work being "To undermine the
                        World of Los &amp; tear bright Enitharmon / To the four winds"
                        (100:35-101:1). The work is continued in 102:14-22, where Urizen gives
                        "life &amp; sense . . . To all his Engines of deceit." The four
                        lines 101:29-32 apparently describe the culmination of this activity: <q>
                            Thus Urizen in self deceit his warlike preparations fabricated<lb/> And
                            when all things were finishd sudden wavd &lt;among the
                            Stars&gt;<lb/> &lt;His hurtling&gt; hand gave the dire
                            signal thunderous Clarions blow<lb/> And all the hollow deep rebellowd
                            with the wondrous war. </q> In their present context these lines simply
                        herald an intensification of the conflict which is seen to be an inherent
                        feature of the fallen world over which Urizen presides; but the lines
                        themselves seem to describe a more decisive event. All of Urizen’s
                        preparations, now described variously in VIIb and VIII, seem to be leading
                        up to such a moment. The sudden, apocalyptic battle-signal should herald the
                        eruption of warfare. We might expect the passage 96:20-98:31, describing the
                        furious response of Los and Tharmas to the outbreak of war, to follow such a
                        signal. The passage apparently has a climactic significance. The
                        relationship between Los and Enitharmon is at its lowest ebb. Los, as in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, rises eagerly to the prospect of war; his
                        appearance is more wrathful here than at any other point in <hi rend="i">The
                            Four Zoas</hi>, and his speech, 96:25-28, emphasizes the apocalyptic
                        dimension of the conflict, closely following Revelation 19:17-18. The last
                        line of the passage hints at the consequences of the spreading confusion,
                        for "Urizen’s web vibrated torment on torment."</p>
          <p>The collapse of Urizen’s web is described in VIII in a sequence which
                        now begins with the Shadowy female’s speech. The collapse occurs at
                        103:21-31, and the description of Urizen’s final degeneration is
                        continued in 106:17-107:36. In 107:32-35, Tharmas and the Spectre of Urthona
                        give their strength to Los: <q> And Tharmas gave his Power to Los Urthona
                            gave his strength<lb/> Into the youthful prophet for the Love of
                            Enitharmon<lb/> And of the nameless Shadowy female in the nether
                            deep<lb/> And for the dread of the dark terrors of Orc &amp; Urizen.
                        </q> These lines seem to anticipate some decisive action by Los, and it is
                        possible that they were followed originally by the description of Los
                        rending the heavens, now found in the beginning of IX. Several factors
                        suggest that this description formed the conclusion of an eighth Night
                        designed to follow VIIal. Night IX originally began on page 119 with the
                        words "Without this Universal Confusion . . . " (119:24). In the
                        poem as it now stands these words clearly apply to the chaos described in
                        the new beginning of the Night; but when they were first transcribed they
                        must have applied to the end of the eighth Night. There is a reference to
                        Los destroying the heavens in the main body of IX, on page 121: <q> Let Orc
                            consume let Tharmas rage let dark Urthona give<lb/> All strength to Los
                            &amp; Enitharmon &amp; let Los self cursd<lb/> Rend down this fabric
                            as a wall ruind &amp; family extinct.<lb/><lb/> (121:23-25) </q> Here
                        the destruction of the heavens is seen as a direct result of the Spectre of
                        Urthona’s attempt to give up his strength to Los. When these lines
                        were transcribed they cannot have referred to the new beginning of IX unless
                        Blake added the new beginning before he had transcribed three pages of <pb id="p12-119" n="119"/> the Night (the lines occur three pages after the
                        original beginning). This seems to confirm that when Blake transcribed the
                        main body of IX, the "Universal Confusion" was described at the
                        end of the eighth Night, after the description of Urthona giving his
                        strength to Los.</p>
          <p>In the new beginning as it now stands, Los’s destructive gesture is
                        described in a passage of thirteen lines (117:1-13) added over an erasure.
                        In the added passage Los is watched over by Jesus, so the action appears to
                        be part of the divine scheme of redemption, and the passage is clearly
                        related to a late addition near the end of VIII (110:38-41). Without the
                        Christian framework the significance of Los’s action would be
                        different. The crucial lines on page 117, in which Los rends "the
                        heavens across from immense to immense" recall his gesture in <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi>, Chapter II, where he stands "frozen
                        amidst / The vast rock of eternity"; "The Prophetic wrath,
                        strug’ling for vent" rends the rock "from immense to
                        immense," and he falls into the abyss. This is an example of the
                        destructive nature of prophetic impatience, marking a further stage in the
                        fall. As originally transcribed, the corresponding action in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> may have been ironically redemptive, taking the
                        confusion of Urizen’s empire to its ultimate limit, a collapse
                        analagous to the destruction of the ego necessary for Man’s
                        awakening.</p>
          <p>In lines 117:24-25, 118:1-6 there is an account of the destruction of the
                        Spectres of Urthona and Enitharmon: <q> The Spectre of Enitharmon let loose
                            on the troubled deep<lb/> Waild Shrill in the confusion &amp; the
                            Spectre of Urthona<lb/> Recievd her in the darkning South their bodies
                            lost they stood<lb/> Trembling &amp; weak a faint embrace a fierce
                            desire as when<lb/> Two shadows mingle on a wall they wail &amp;
                            shadowy tears<lb/> Fell down &amp; shadowy forms of joy mixd with
                            despair &amp; grief<lb/> Their bodies buried in the ruins of the
                            Universe<lb/> Mingled with the confusion. Who shall call them from the
                            Grave. </q> The "Spectre of Enitharmon" here is clearly an
                        alternative term for the "Shadow" that appears in VIIal as a
                        result of a further division of Urthona. The passage seems to be an attempt
                        to resolve the problem of Urthona’s disintegration. No solution is
                        offered in VIIal. The added endings of VIIa do not completely resolve this
                        division, but they do introduce a principle by which unity may be achieved:
                        the principle of self-annihilation. Compared with the new endings of VIIa,
                        the solution offered in the passage above seems crudely mechanical. The
                        outcome would seem to be a separation from Los, rather than integration with
                        him, as their bodies lie "buried in the ruins of the
                        Universe."</p>
          <p>The additions at the end of VIIal (i.e. in VIIa2) almost seem to take the
                        situation described above as their starting point. In the additions, the
                        Spectre speaks to astound Los’s ear with "irresistable
                        conviction" <q> Of thy fierce Soul Unbar the Gates of Memory look upon
                            me<lb/> Not as another but as thy real Self I am thy Spectre<lb/> Tho
                            horrible &amp; Ghastly to thine Eyes tho buried beneath<lb/> The ruins
                            of the Universe.<lb/><lb/> (85:37-40) </q> It seems that the account of
                        the Spectre of Urthona’s union with the Spirit of Enitharmon now
                        contained in the new beginning of IX was composed before the additions at
                        the end of VIIa were conceived. In fact the account may be Blake’s
                        original solution to the problem of Urthona’s disintegration, a
                        problem which is prominent in VIIal. Other manifestations of error
                        introduced in VIIal—Urizen’s books and the Tree of
                        Mystery—are consumed in the new beginning of IX, so the narrative as
                        a whole would have formed an appropriate conclusion to an eighth Night
                        designed to follow on from VIIal.</p>
          <p>There does seem to be evidence, then, to support Bentley’s suggestion
                        that in the process of revising the eighth Night, Blake rewrote it as two
                        Nights, the first of which was VIIb. There are traces of a narrative
                        sequence which may have been dislocated in the process of revision. This
                        sequence probably began with the embrace of Vala and Orc, may have described
                        how Urizen’s empire-building culminated in an apocalyptic
                        confrontation with Tharmas and Los and in the collapse of Urizen’s
                        web and the stupefaction of all of Man’s faculties except
                        Los—who pulled down the heavens. Such a narrative would have formed
                        an appropriate sequel to VIIal, and I shall subsequently refer to this
                        (lost) version of the eighth Night as "VIIIa."</p>

          <p>At this stage, a consideration of the ninth Night may prove helpful, and
                        Bentley’s comments on this Night make a convenient starting point for
                        discussion. He suggests that early drafts of the eighth and ninth Nights may
                        have been bound together with pages 43-84, and "may have described a
                        titanic war among the Zoas (Night VIIb seems to be a prelude to such a war).
                        This war would have resulted in ‘Universal Confusion’ (with
                        which Night IX begins, page 119), and have been resolved perhaps, in the
                        reunion of the four Zoas in the Eternal Man." He suggests that as VIII
                        and IX contain overt Christian references, they are probably later than
                        VIIb: "They were probably recopied when VIIb was, but Blake’s
                        rapidly changing ideas may have forced him to transcribe Nights VIII and IX
                        yet once or twice again." He suggests that IX is earlier than the
                        existing VIII, and concludes: "Presumably Blake’s major
                        alteration from the previous draft of Night IX was in his composition or
                        rewriting of the great harvest of the vintage which concludes the
                            Night."<ref target="n69" type="note">8</ref><note id="n69"><hi rend="s">8</hi> Bentley, p. 163.</note></p>
          <p>For convenience I shall refer to the main body of the ninth Night, without
                        the new beginning (i.e. 119:24-139:10) as "IX*." It seems that the
                        absence of stitch marks in IX* leads Bentley to conclude that this Night
                        must have replaced an earlier copy; it follows from this that IX* must have
                        evolved <pb id="p12-120" n="120"/> through a major revision of the
                        "earlier version," as only such a major revision would justify the
                        complete retranscription of a Night. But as we have noted, internal evidence
                        is likely to provide a surer indication of relative date than the absence or
                        presence of stitch marks. Curiously, Bentley’s hypothesis for the
                        "original" ninth Night seems quite appropriate to IX*, which does
                        resolve the Universal Confusion "with the reunion of the four Zoas in
                        the Eternal Man." How much of IX*, then, if any, is the product of
                        subsequent revision?</p>
          <p>The harvest and vintage sequence begins at 124:6 and continues to the end of
                        the poem, forming the greater part of the Night. There are obvious
                        precedents for such a sequence in Revelation 14:14-20, and in <hi rend="i">Ahania</hi>, where Urizen is introduced as the eternal sower. The
                        detail in which the sequence of ploughing, sowing, and harvesting is
                        described in IX* suggests that Blake was drawing on his observation of the
                        rural life around Felpham, and the sequence contains none of the Christian
                        references that might be regarded as conclusive evidence of revision,
                        although some elements could be regarded as late relative to pages 43-85.
                        First, there is a development in the presentation of Beulah: Urizen and his
                        sons, wearied after the sowing, receive visions on the "Couches of
                        Beulah" (131:21). Their vision is the long pastoral interlude in which
                        Luvah and Vala, and Tharmas and Enion, are reunited in innocence. However,
                        this development is anticipated in the Shadow of Enitharmon’s account
                        of the fall in VIIal, where Beulah is indentified as a region of dreams, a
                        pastoral retreat from Eternity, an enticing world where Man’s fall
                        began: "he forgot Eternity delighted in his sweet joy / Among his
                        family his flocks &amp; herds &amp; tents &amp; pastures"
                        (83:21-22).</p>
          <p>The denunciation of Mystery on page 134 is clearly a direct allusion to the
                        archetypal female of Revelation 17 and 18, but it is not certain that when
                        IX* was transcribed the name Mystery had the specific meaning that it has in
                        VIII, where it is the name of the most degenerate form of Vala, Rahab. In VI
                        one of Urizen’s daughters is identified with the female of Revelation
                        by the writing on her forehead, and the female in IX* may have been
                        introduced similarly, as a simple personification of Urizenic mystery,
                        appropriate to the apocalyptic context. The names "Satan,"
                        "Rahab", and "Mystery the Harlot" appear only in an
                        addition to IX* (120: 47,49), suggesting that the specific symbolic meanings
                        they have in the poem were developed after the Night had been
                        transcribed.</p>
          <p>The introduction of the Eternals on page 133 indicates Blake’s growing
                        sense of the existence of an unfallen reality, a development which
                        culminated in the introduction of "the Council of God;" and the
                        reference to the "Mercy Divine" at 125:39 suggests an unequivocal
                        faith in divine providence. However, there are references to "The ever
                        pitying one who seeth all things" and to "Providence divine"
                        in VI (71:25-26, 74:31-32); and the Eternals are to some extent anticipated
                        in the Shadow of Enitharmon’s account of the fall in VIIal:
                        "Wonder siezd / All heaven they saw him dark. they built a golden wall
                        / Round Beulah" (83:9-11). If the Eternals in IX* do indicate a new
                        concern with divine intervention, they are clearly closer to the Eternals of
                            <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> than to the providential Council of God. (As in
                            <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi>, the intervention of the Eternals described in
                        133:15-21 contributes to man’s fall.)</p>
          <p>Finally, the reference to the "crown of thorns" which falls from
                        Luvah’s head (135:23) as he rises from the Eternal feast may be an
                        example of the identification of Christ and Luvah which becomes important in
                        the Christian additions to the poem, although there are no other examples of
                        this identification in IX*, and as a passing reference the line may simply
                        describe the risen Orc relinquishing the trappings of the Tree of
                        Mystery.</p>
          <p>There seems to be little in the harvest and vintage sequence which can be
                        identified as the product of a major revision. In fact, the only parts of
                        IX* which contain symbolism for which there is no precedent in the basic
                        text of 43-85 are those passages near the beginning of the Night which refer
                        directly to Christ and Jerusalem.</p>
          <p>Man’s awakening, as it is described at the beginning of IX*, involves
                        the gradual reassertion of his will. Responding to the Universal Confusion
                        he reasons with himself until he recovers first a sense of determination,
                        and then feelings of wrath (120:27). This active struggle is the natural
                        sequel to the resignation of will described in the copperplate text
                        (23:3,5,6). However, after a description of the regeneration of Urizen,
                        there is a passage in which Man describes his awakening in terms of a divine
                        intervention. The passage begins: <q> Behold Jerusalem in whose bosom the
                            Lamb of God<lb/> Is seen tho slain before her Gates he self renewd
                            remains<lb/> Eternal &amp; I thro him awake to life from deaths dark
                            vale.<lb/><lb/> (122:1-3) </q> These lines introduce a description of
                        the seasonal revival of Ahania in a harmonious relationship with Urizen,
                        followed by five lines in which Jerusalem is hailed as the bride of Christ,
                        "Mother of myriads redeemd &amp; born in her spiritual palaces / By a
                        New Spiritual birth Regenerated from Death" (122:19-20). This allusion
                        to Revelation 21 shows a new readiness to use Christian symbolism in a
                        direct way, but the providential awakening mentioned here seems quite
                        irrelevant to the awakening actually described, and seems to deny the
                        importance of Man’s struggle to reassert his will. This suggests that
                        the eight lines referring to the Lamb of God were not originally an integral
                        part of the passage in which they now appear, although they must have been
                        introduced before page 122 was transcribed as they are in the basic text. In
                        IX* there is no mention of the Council of God, and there is nothing to
                        connect Jerusalem with Golgonooza, nor with Los (who is mentioned only four
                        times in the Night), nor with Enitharmon (who is mentioned only twice). The
                        immediate connection between St. John’s vision and the basic myth of
                        IX* (apart from the obvious fact that both describe an apocalypse) is the
                        fact that St. John’s vision involves the ordering of a creative
                        sexual relationship, a principle of vital importance <pb id="p12-121" n="121"/> in the reintegration of Man’s faculties in
                        Blake’s poem. The passage framed by the Christian lines on page 122
                        describes the relationship between Ahania and Urizen in its ideal form.
                        Blake seems to have introduced the Christian symbolism in a context which
                        emphasizes the correspondence between the sexual harmony required in his own
                        myth and that which forms the climax of Revelation.</p>
          <p>The other example of this kind of Christiann symbolism occurs at the end of a
                        passage describing how the dead gather, waiting to be delivered. Again,
                        Blake seems to have introduced references to Revelation in a context which
                        enables a general analogy to be made: Jerusalem appears as "the
                        innocent accused before the Judges" (123:22) and, like the crucified
                        Christ, is identified with the oppressed who now rise to be delivered from
                        their oppressors. The vision of the Cloud of Blood is seen as the climax of
                        the violent destruction of the universe, and identifies the destruction with
                        the Judgment of Christ’s second coming. The vision includes <q> four
                            Wonders of the Almighty<lb/> Incomprehensible. pervading all amidst
                            &amp; round about<lb/> Fourfold each in the other reflected they are
                            named Life’s in Eternity.<lb/><lb/> (123:36-38) </q> Margoliouth,
                        commenting on the word "Life’s" in the last line, writes:
                        "in spite of the apostrophe I think this is a plural and is a
                        translation of ζῶα Zoa, the ‘beasts’ or living creatures of
                        Revelation 4. . . . The four ‘Life’s’ have not here
                        been identified with Urthona, Luvah, Urizen and Tharmas, so providing a new
                        title for <hi rend="i">Vala.</hi>"<ref target="n70" type="note">9</ref>
                        As Margoliouth suggests, the symbolism of this passage has not really been
                        assimilated into the symbolic structure of the Night. The references to
                        divine intervention are registered as interpolations which remain ultimately
                        separate from the rest of the Night. This is the fundamental difference
                        between the Christian references in IX* and those in VIII. In any Night that
                        had been retranscribed at least once to accomodate material which would
                        radically modify the conceptual basis of the poem, we might expect the new
                        ideas to revise the existing ideas satisfactorily; we might expect their
                        modifying effect to be dominant, if not complete. This is largely their
                        effect in VIII. If the first fourteen lines or so of VIII are compared with
                        the awakening described in IX*, the formalizing effect that the Christian
                        framework was to have is evident. In the lines at the beginning of VIII the
                        machinery of divine intervention has been fully developed, but at the
                        expense of the will: Man responds passively to a regulated scheme of
                        redemption in which his own will plays no part. In IX* the Christian
                        references have no such controlling effect, but are subordinate in a
                        narrative which is otherwise conceptually compatible with the basic text of
                        pages 43-85. The limited importance of these references suggests that they
                        were not introduced as part of a carefully planned revision; they seem to
                        have been introduced more as an immediate response to the major model for
                        the Last Judgment, the Book of Revelation, and Blake may even have decided
                        to introduce them while he was actually transcribing the Night. Their extent
                        is so limited that their inclusion would hardly seem to have justified the
                        complete retranscription of the Night, or even of the individual leaves on
                        which they occur. As there seems to be little evidence of major revision
                        elsewhere in the Night, it seems likely that the Christian references were
                        included in Blake’s first transcription of his "Last
                        Judgment," which survives as the basic text of IX*. <note id="n70"><hi rend="s">9</hi> H. M. Margoliouth, ed., <hi rend="i">Vala,

          <p>This study of the ninth Night implies that IX*, like VIIa1, was part of a
                        single draft of the poem which included the basic text of pages 43-76 and a
                        copy of the eight Night similar to the sequence I have called
                        "VIIIa". Within this draft the lengths of the Nights had tended to
                        increase towards the end of the poem, and there had obviously been some
                        development in the symbolism. For example, Beulah had become more important
                        towards the end of the poem, and Christian symbolism had been introduced in
                        the ninth Night. It has long been recognized that much of the text on the
                        proof pages may have been composed while Blake was staying with Hayley at
                        Felpham. Commenting on the proof text, Margoliouth pointed out that
                        "Some of the Tharmas passages, especially in Nights III and IV, point
                        to a personal knowledge of the sea which we have no reason to suppose Blake
                        had before he went to Felpham."<ref target="n71" type="note">10</ref>
                        As we have noted, Blake may have been influenced by his observation of the
                        rural countryside around Felpham in his treatment of eternal harvest in the
                        ninth Night. Blake’s letters from Felpham help to illuminate some of
                        the developments in the poem. <note id="n71"><hi rend="s">10</hi>
                            Margoliouth, pp. xxiii-xxiv.</note></p>
          <p>After the depressing final years at Lambeth, the removal to the peaceful
                        environment of Felpham and the security of Hayley’s patronage seem to
                        have given Blake a profound sense of spiritual release. His enthusiasm is
                        evident in his first letters from Felpham, and a fortnight after his arrival
                        he sent a poem to Butts which describes his "First Vision of
                            Light."<ref target="n72" type="note">11</ref> The poem relates how,
                        on the beach at Felpham, he has a vision in which his limbs are infolded in
                        beams of gold by "One Man." This is a regeneration visualized in
                        terms far removed from the fierce, revolutionary apocalypse of the Lambeth
                        books. The tone and imagery of the poem are mild, the poet is passive, there
                        is little sense of a determined imaginative effort. This implies an
                        awareness of divine providence which had largely been absent from
                        Blake’s work since <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>, and the poem
                        also suggests a new readiness to use direct (as opposed to satirical)
                        Christian parallels. The "One Man" may be identified readily with
                        the New Testament "Good Shepherd." Man’s vision of
                        Jerusalem on page 122, derived from Revelation 21, has obvious similarities
                        with the "Vision of Light" that Blake described to Butts: just as
                        Blake was reborn in a renewed environment at "Female" Felpham, so
                        Man is awakened by Christ to be reborn in Jerusalem’s "spiritual
                        palaces." Blake’s adoption of Christian symbolism in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> may have begun with his tentative attempt to
                        reinterpret the resurrection described in the ninth Night in the light of
                        his growing awareness of a <pb id="p12-122" n="122"/> divine providence. The
                        willingness to adopt symbols from both Testaments of the bible, a
                        willingness apparent in additions to the poem, was undoubtedly stimulated
                        further by his study first of Greek, and then of Hebrew, begun under
                        Hayley’s supervision at Felpham. By January 1803 Blake felt confident
                        of his mastery of Greek, and was looking forward to reading "The Hebrew
                            bible."<ref target="n73" type="note">12</ref><note id="n72"><hi rend="s">11</hi> See the letter to Butts of 2 Oct. 1800:

          <p>In a letter to Butts dated 22 November 1802,<ref target="n74" type="note">13</ref> Blake included a poem "composed above a twelve month
                        ago" which, after dramatizing some of the doubts and uncertainties he
                        suffered at Felpham, ends triumphantly: <q> Now I a fourfold vision see<lb/>
                            And a fourfold vision is given to me. </q> Whether the word
                        "Now" in the first line refers to the date of the rest of the
                        verses, which were composed "above a twelve month ago" (i.e. in
                        1801), or to the date of the letter (November 1802) is open to question. But
                        it seems unlikely that Blake could have delayed by a year the announcement
                        of the gift of fourfold vision, and these last lines may have been added to
                        the rest of the poem when the letter was written (i.e., Blake was writing of
                        past difficulties which had now, in November 1802, been resolved). Another
                        letter to Butts of the same day seems to confirm this, for Blake declared
                        "I am again Emerged into the light of day; I still &amp; shall to
                        Eternity Embrace Christianity and Adore him who is the express image of God
                        . . . My Enthusiasm is still what it was, only Enlarged and

                        the tone of this letter expresses more than the need to keep in favor with a
                        more orthodox patron; it suggests that as Blake progressed into fourfold
                        vision, Christianity assumed a new meaning for him. <note id="n74"><hi rend="s">13</hi> Keynes, pp. 816-19.</note><note id="n75"><hi rend="s">14</hi> Keynes, pp. 815-16.</note></p>

                        of Beulah into thy dread vortex following / Thy Eddying spirit down the
                        hills of Beulah" (50:5-6). This reference to the "Sons of
                        Beulah" is unique: Blake normally refers to the "Sons of
                        Eden" and the "Daughters of Beulah," and the reference in IV
                        may have survived from a time when Blake regarded Beulah as Man’s,
                        eternal dwelling place, the highest attainable ideal. When he received the
                        gift of fourfold vision Beulah would naturally come to be seen as a lower
                        paradise, and the need to distinguish the different degrees of vision in a
                        coherent symbolic structure must have become apparent. A passage in the
                        Shadow of Enitharmon’s account of the fall in VIIa1 seems to be an
                        early attempt to make such a distinction: <q> Wonder siezd<lb/> All heaven
                            they saw him dark. they built a golden wall<lb/> Round Beulah There he
                            reveld in delight among the Flowers.<lb/><lb/> (83:9-11) </q> Here
                        Beulah is clearly identified as a lower paradise, distinguished from a
                        higher ideal identified vaguely as "All heaven." In IX* there is a
                        further development, for Beulah is identified as a resting place from
                        Eternity where Man reposes, entertained by dreams before his
                        resurrection.</p>
          <p>There are two descriptions of cyclical relationships in IX*. In the long
                        pastoral passage Tharmas complains: <q> the sweet smelling fruit<lb/>
                            Revives me to new deaths I fade even like a water lilly<lb/> In the suns
                            heat till in the night on the couch of Enion<lb/> I drink new
                            life.<lb/><lb/> (131:2-5) </q> The recurring cycle described here is
                        comparable to the cycle which Blake developed more fully in "The Mental
                        Traveller." In introducing this myth showing history as a series of
                        recurring cycles, Blake was beginning to go beyond the original structure of
                            <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, which was concerned with a single cycle
                        from fall to redemption. As a counterpart to the relationship of Tharmas and
                        Enion there is a description of an ideal cyclical relationship between males
                        and females, in which the obedient female sacrifices herself so that the
                        male remains "Immortal": <q> Then bright Ahania shall awake from
                            death<lb/> A glorious Vision to thine Eyes a Self renewing Vision<lb/>
                            The spring. the summer to be thine then sleep the wintry days<lb/> In
                            silken garments spun by her own hands against her funeral.<lb/><lb/>
                            (122:6-9) </q> This harmonious relationship is the converse of the
                        time-bound cycle, and both cycles suggest that when Blake transcribed IX* he
                        was already beginning to devise a structure in which the different levels of
                        vision would be characterized by distinct and antithetical modes of
                        existence.</p>
          <p>The new developments visible in VIIa1 and IX* are on a small scale and do not
                        seriously threaten the general coherence of the narrative in which they
                        occur. Bentley has discovered that page 48 of the manuscript was used as a
                        backing sheet when Blake was printing engravings for Hayley’s ballads
                        at Felpham. Engravings for the first ballad are dated 1 June 1802, and, as
                        it is very unlikely that Blake would temporarily remove a page of his
                        manuscript to use it as a backing sheet, it is reasonable to conclude, as
                        Bentley does, <ref target="n76" type="note">15</ref> that the page was not
                        transcribed until after the end of May 1802. Pages 43-84 may have been bound
                        together some time after this date; and as we have seen, at least one leaf
                        (pages 111-12) seems to have been bound before any thing was written on it.
                        Early in 1803, two months after Blake had written to Butts about
                        "fourfold vision," his letters began to refer to the completion of
                        a major work, and on 6 July he mentioned <q> a Sublime Allegory, which is
                            now perfectly completed into a Grand Poem. . . . This poem <pb id="p12-123" n="123"/> shall by Divine Assistance be progressively
                            Printed and Ornamented with Prints &amp; given to the Public.<ref target="n77" type="note">16</ref></q> Frye thinks that this "does not literally apply to <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, which was never completed into anything."<ref target="n78" type="note">17</ref> But although the poem was never
                        "progressively Printed and Ornamented with Prints" there is no
                        reason to suppose that it was never completed into anything. The poem as it
                        stands contains revisions almost certainly made after 1803; but Blake could
                        have been referring to an intermediate stage of composition in which nine
                        Nights had been completed into a unified and symbolically homogeneous whole.
                        It is possible that Blake was referring to a single draft of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> which included a revised copperplate text, pages
                        43-85 and IX*. Blake’s symbolism may have begun to develop in new
                        directions when his Grand Poem was almost complete. This would explain the
                        new developments apparent in VIIal and IX*; and it would also explain why
                        Blake subsequently began to revise the poem, to integrate the new ideas more
                        fully. <note id="n76"><hi rend="s">15</hi> Bentley, p. 161.</note><note id="n77"><hi rend="s">16</hi> Keynes, p. 825.</note><note id="n78"><hi rend="s">17</hi> Northrop Frye, <hi rend="i">Fearful

              <hi rend="b">THE FIRST REVISION OF THE EIGHTH NIGHT</hi>
            </title>
          </head>
          <p>If VIIb <hi rend="i">was</hi> composed during a revision of
                        "VIIIa," what kind of changes were made to the eighth Night at
                        this stage? The text of VIIb and of the present eighth Night should provide
                        useful clues. The existence of VIIb suggests that Blake was extremely
                        reluciant to discard material once it had been used in the poem, and so it
                        may be possible to find traces in VIII of material introduced in any
                        previous revision (even if it has been subsequently modified). Night VIII is
                        manifestly composite, and consists of: (i) six leaves which contain a
                        continuous narrative running from the title-page (page 99) to page 110, on
                        which "End of the eighth Night" was twice written and twice
                        erased; and (ii) three leaves (pages 111-16) which contain material to be
                        interpolated in or added to pages 99-110. For convenience I shall refer to
                        the basic text of pages 99-110 as "VIII*." This text ends at
                        110:28, "And all his Sorrows till he reassumes his ancient
                        bliss."</p>
          <p>Broadly speaking, VIII* falls into three sections, as the Night is divided by
                        a sequence describing the descent, judgment, and crucifixion of Christ, the
                        sequence occuring almost exactly in the middle of the Night (104:5 to
                        106:6). The last part of the Night begins "Darkness &amp; sorrow
                        coverd all flesh Eternity was darkend," and from this point to the end
                        of VIII* there is nothing in the basic text necessarily later than the basic
                        text of pages 43-85. Although the rest of VIII* contains highly developed
                        Christian symbolism, the reference to the Divine Lamb at 107:37-39 and
                        110:1-2 are both subsequent additions; and there is no mention of the
                        redemptive labors of Los and Enitharmon in this part of the narrative,
                        although they are prominent in the rest of the Night. This suggests that the
                        last section may have been composed before the development of Blake’s
                        Christian symbolism was advanced, and before Los had begun to assume an
                        actively redemptive role in the poem. The section ends, after Tharmas and
                        the Spectre give up their strength to Los, with the final lamentation of
                        Ahania and Enion’s comforting answer. One of Blake’s first
                        revisions to VIIIa may have been the addition of the lament with
                        Enion’s reply, which would have displaced the original ending (Los
                        rending the heavens), which would then have to be added at the beginning of
                        the ninth Night. Such a revision, while changing the ending of the eighth
                        Night from an explosive climax to a passage of elegiac expectation, would
                        help to re-establish the presence of Enion and Ahania (who are largely
                        absent from the central Nights of the poem) before their resurrection in the
                        last Night.</p>
          <p>The material in the basic text of VIIb which seems manifestly late indicates
                        that when the Night was composed, Blake was beginning to define the
                        different degrees of vision in a coherent structure. In VIIal and IX* Beulah
                        had been distinguished from Eternity; in VIIb two more levels are
                        distinguished, although they are not named. The Shadowy female extends
                        through one: <q> far &amp; wide she stretchd thro all the worlds of Urizens
                            journey<lb/> And was Adjoind to Beulah as the Polypus to the
                            Rock.<lb/><lb/> (95:1-2) </q> This world has been the scene of most of
                        the events described in the poem, but now Blake distinguished a lower world
                        "Beyond the Limit of Translucence," the world of single vision and
                        opacity which was subsequently called "Ulro." As the dead descend
                        into this world to form Satan, the daughters of Beulah sing songs of
                        comfort, "Waiting with Patience for the fulfilment of the Promise
                        Divine." This passage suggests that when Blake composed VIIb he
                        envisaged a comprehensive scheme of divine intervention which would control
                        the events of the fallen world.</p>
          <p>At the end of IV Blake made two additions, the first of which was twenty-two
                        lines long, transcribed over the original (erased) Night ending, at the foot
                        of page 55 and at the top of page 56. It was marked for insertion after 55:9
                        (i.e., it was designed to follow the description of Los binding Urizen). In
                        this addition the daughters of Beulah observe the fallen world from
                        "Beulahs mild moon coverd regions," and take comfort in the Divine
                        Vision embodied in the Council of God. The last six lines of the passage,
                        which were subsequently erased, may have described a measure of divine
                        intervention by the Council, and, if Erdman’s conjecture for the
                        fourth line is correct, the founding of the limit of Contraction.<ref target="n79" type="note">18</ref> The founding of this limit is
                        described in the passage which replaced these six lines, and also the
                        founding of the "Limit of Opacity" or Translucence, which suggests
                        that the erased lines may also have described the founding of the limit of
                        Translucence. This means that the first addition at the end of IV may have
                        been designed to prepare for the related passage in VIIb, where the dead
                        descend below the limit of Translucence to become Satan. (In the first
                        addition the daughters of Beulah quote Martha’s rebuke to Jesus:
                        "Lord if thou had’st been here, my brother had not died,"
                        John 11:21; in VIIb the daughters are comforted by Christ’s reply to
                        Martha, "Thy brother shall rise again," v. 23.) <note id="n79"><hi rend="s">18</hi> David V. Erdman, ed., and Harold Bloom, <hi rend="i">The Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>, rev. edn. (New

          <p>The passage at the beginning of the eighth Night, in which the Council,
                        described as a "Vision of all Beulah," meets to create the fallen
                        man, brings the scheme initiated at the end of IV to fruition.
                        Christ’s descent and the final epiphany of Satan in the eighth Night
                        are seen as the culmination of a divine scheme which has been observed in
                        all its stages by the daughters of Beulah. The description of the Council of
                        God in the eighth Night, then, is closely related to the first addition at
                        the end of IV and to the passage in VIIb describing the formation of Satan,
                        and it was probably introduced during the revision which produced VIIb. The
                        passage may have been modified subsequently when Blake composed VIII*, for
                        it contains Old Testament references and the term "Eden," for
                        which there is no precedent in VIIb. Similarly, it seems unlikely that the
                        second addition at the end of IV, or the reference to the story of Lazarus
                        on page 21 (lines 9-10) were added at this time; both passages contain
                        terms, such as "Emanation," which seem later than anything in the
                        basic text of either VIIb or VIII*.</p>
          <p>It seems clear that when Blake composed VIIb he must have planned to include
                        in the eight Night some kind of sequence describing the epiphany of Satan,
                        and the incarnation and crucifixion of Christ. The late passage in VIIb
                        clearly prepares for Satan’s epiphany, and the crucifixion would form
                        the prelude to the triumphant second coming which had already been described
                        in the ninth Night. There is little in the account of Satan’s
                        epiphany described on page 104 in VIII* that is not anticipated in VIIb or
                        compatible with the Christian passages in IX*, except perhaps the
                        introduction of the "Sons of Eden." The last lines on page 104
                        originally stated that the Lamb of God would "rend the Veil of Mystery
                        / And the Call Urizen &amp; Luvah &amp; Tharmas &amp; Urthona,"
                        which prescribes a more directly active role for Christ than he actually has
                        in the rest of VIII*: they suggest that he will become a kind of divine
                        caretaker who will assume responsibility for reintegrating the faculties on
                        Man’s behalf. In VIII* Man’s regeneration depends on the
                        creative labors of an enlightened Los who is inspired by Christ. The
                        pencilled addition at 104:31, "Los said to Enitharmon Pitying I
                        saw," may be an attempt to maintain the presence of Los in a passage
                        which was conceived before Los had been seen as an enlightened redeemer.
                        There may also have been an early version of the judgment and crucifixion
                        which was subsequently revised to produce the fragment p. 145, and the final
                        version 105:1 to 106:6.</p>
          <p>Each of these additions to the eighth Night—the description of the
                        Council of God, the Christian sequence, the lament of Ahania and
                        Enion’s answer—would have increased the length of the eighth
                        Night. This increase in size, together with the fact that the introduction
                        of a scheme of divine intervention would have a far-reaching effect on the
                        poem as a whole, may have prompted Blake to undertake a major reorganization
                        of the narrative sequence of the Night. It was probably at this stage that
                        Blake decided to add the new beginning to the ninth Night and to compose an
                        entirely new Night, VIIb, taking from VIIIa the description of the Vala-Orc
                        embrace, the construction of Urizen’s empire, and the passage
                        describing how Tharmas, Los, and Enitharmon react to the warfare.</p>
          <p>In composing VIIb, Blake would have to change the sequence and the
                        significance of events originally described in the eighth Night. The warfare
                        was now seen to begin not with Urizen’s apocalyptic battle-signal but
                        with the Vala-Orc embrace; and the conflict became an inherent feature of
                        Urizen’s empire, rather than the culmination of his elaborate
                        preparations. Orc no longer loses his rage completely at the moment of the
                        embrace with Vala, for although the embrace is now described in VIIb, the
                        description of Orc’s transformation on the Tree of Mystery is
                        retained in the eighth Night, the swelling Orc symbolizing enslaved energy
                        bound in the widening conflict of Urizen’s empire. Orc is thus seen
                        as an active force in Urizen’s empire. Orc and Urizen are now seen to
                        be "Communing" (100:33).</p>
          <p>Night VIIb seems to have been composed before Blake had reassessed the role
                        of Los, for he appears in the Night as a wrathful figure rather than a
                        patient, enlightened redeemer. The major difference between the version of
                        the eighth Night produced at this stage and the present VIII* (apart from
                        local revisions) would be the absence of the three passages which in VIII*
                        describe the redemptive labors of Los and Enitharmon (99:20 to 100:26,
                        101:35-37, 103:32 to 104:4). In other respects the outline of the eighth
                        Night—beginning with a description of the Council of God, continuing
                        with chaotic warfare, a central sequence describing the crucifixion, and
                        concluding with a passage possibly identical to <pb id="p12-125" n="125"/>
                        106:17 to 110:28—would have been very similar to VIII*. I shall
                        subsequently refer to this second version of the eighth Night, contemporary
                        with VIIb, as "VIIIb."</p>
          <p>When he transcribed VIIb Blake probably did not intend to exclude VIIal from
                        the poem, as both Nights contain elements essential to the coherence of the
                        poem’s narrative, and VIIb seems to have been designed to follow on
                        from the end of VIIal. As Bentley suggests,<ref target="n80" type="note">19</ref> it seems likely that Blake intended to conflate the first
                        seven Nights into six; but whatever revision he had in mind, he
                        doesn’t seem to have carried it out at this time, and he probably
                        deferred the problem of reconciling the two seventh Nights. <note id="n80"><hi rend="s">19</hi> Bentley, p. 163.</note></p>
          <p>Although VIIb had just under 300 lines as originally transcribed (comparable
                        to VI and VIIal), it was transcribed on four leaves instead of the usual
                        five, and no room was left for a full-page drawing on the final page. This
                        suggests that when he transcribed VIIb Blake had used up most of the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> proof-leaves, and had started to use them
                        more sparingly. The new beginning of the ninth Night was probably
                        transcribed at about the same time. An addition at 118:7 refers to Rahab and
                        Tirzah, who are mentioned nowhere else in the new beginning, although they
                        occur in the basic text of VIII*. This suggests that the new beginning was
                        probably transcribed before VIII* was composed. However, it seems unlikely
                        that the revised eighth Night ("VIIIb") was transcribed at this
                        stage. The last part of VIII* (106:17 to the end), as we have seen, contains
                        no late symbolism in the basic text, and was probably identical to the last
                        section of VIIIb. It seems unlikely that Blake would copy out this section
                            <hi rend="i">twice</hi>, once in VIIIb and again in VIII*, without
                        making any changes. Before it was transcribed the eighth Night probably
                        underwent further revision.</p>

          </head>
          <p>In a letter to Hayley of 23 October 1804, Blake suddenly made an unusually
                        enthusiastic announcement: <q> I have entirely reduced that spectrous Fiend
                            to his station, whose annoyance has been the ruin of my labours for the
                            last passed twenty years of my life. He is the enemy of conjugal love
                            and is the Jupiter of the Greeks, an iron-hearted tyrant, the ruiner of
                            ancient Greece. . . . Suddenly, on the day after visiting the
                            Truchsessian Gallery of pictures, I was again enlightened with the light
                            I enjoyed in my youth, and which has for exactly twenty years been
                            closed from me as by a door and by window-shutters. . . . he is become
                            my servant who domineered over me, he is even a brother who was my
                                enemy.<ref target="n81" type="note">20</ref><note id="n81"><hi rend="s">20</hi> Keynes, p. 935.</note></q></p>
          <p>As John Sutherland has observed, this enlightenment seems similar to the one
                        experienced by Los in some of the additions to <hi rend="i">The Four
                            Zoas</hi>: "After 1804, Blake seems more concerned with
                        communicating a method he had discovered by which men may win free from
                        individual, internal tyranny—a method by which an individual may free
                        himself from the domination of one distorted aspect of his own psyche
                        (either from Urizen, or from the Spectre of his dominant Zoa—in
                        Blake’s case, from the Spectre of Urthona)."<ref target="n82" type="note">21</ref> Throughout much of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>
                        Los appears as a spectral figure. In the main body of the ninth Night, for
                        example, he is mentioned only a few times, once near the very end of the
                        poem, where he is not clearly distinguished from the Spectre of Urthona: <q>
                            Urthona is arisen in his strength no longer now<lb/> Divided from
                            Enitharmon no longer the Spectre Los<lb/> Where is the Spectre of
                            Prophecy the delusive phantom.<lb/><lb/> (139:4-6) </q> The apparent
                        lack of distinction between Los and the Spectre in parts of the poem
                        possibly reflects Blake’s own difficulties in freeing his prophetic
                        voice from its attendant Spectre. In additions at the end of VIIa the
                        relationship between Los and the Spectre is brought into focus. The original
                        Night-ending on page 85 [after line 18] was erased to make room for an
                        addition of six lines in which <q> Los Embracd the Spectre first as a
                            brother<lb/> Then as another Self; astonishd humanizing &amp; in
                            tears<lb/> In Self abasement Giving up his Domineering lust. </q> There
                        are echoes in these lines of the extract from the letter quoted above; and
                        in another letter to Hayley (4 December 1804) Blake writes in similar terms
                        that he has lived a "Divided Existence"<ref target="n83" type="note">22</ref> but is no longer at war with himself. The passages
                        in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> in which Los unites with his Spectre to
                        assume the role of enlightened redeemer were probably suggested by the
                        dramatic enlightenment that followed Blake’s visit to the
                        Truchsessian Gallery in the Autumn of 1804. <note id="n82"><hi rend="s">21</hi> John Sutherland, "Blake and Urizen," <hi rend="i">Blake’s Visionary Forms Dramatic</hi>, ed. David V. Erdman

          <p>The new enlightenment seems to have come after VIIb was transcribed, and
                        after the Christianization of the poem had begun, but before the second
                        version of the eighth Night (VIIIb) had been copied out. It was a
                        development which would cause a peculiar problem of organization. When VIIb
                        was composed, it seems probable that Christ’s descent in the eighth
                        Night was to have been the major turning point in the poem, because at this
                        stage in the poem’s development none of Man’s faculties would
                        have been capable of enlightened action (Los’s final rending of the
                        heavens would have been an act of desperation rather than an enlightened
                        gesture). When Los became an enlightened redeemer, Christ’s descent
                        would appear as a culmination rather than a turning point. The redemptive
                        labors of Los would be described most appropriately in the prelude to
                        Man’s awakening, the eighth Night. But as Los’s reconciliation
                        with the Spectre provides a partial solution to the problem of
                        Urthona’s disintegration, a problem which is discussed in some detail
                        by the Spectre and the Shadow of Enitharmon at the end of VIIal, the
                        reinterpretation of Los would inevitably strengthen the narrative links
                        between the end of VIIal and the eighth Night—despite the fact that
                        the two Nights were now separated by the new Night, VIIb.</p>
          <pb id="p12-126" n="126"/>
          <p>The exact nature of this problem will become clear if we examine some of the
                        elements of the VIIb narrative. At the end of VIIal the rebirth of Vala is
                        described thus: "a Cloud she grew &amp; grew / Till many of the dead
                        burst forth from the bottoms of their tombs" (85:17-18). Before later
                        additions were made to this page, the last line would seem to have had only
                        a general significance, identifying Vala’s rebirth as an event of
                        apocalyptic importance. A variant of the same line occurs in VIIb, where the
                        dead descend beyong the limit of Translucence to form Satan (95:11-14).
                        There "the Dead" begin to take on a specific importance in the
                        developing mythology. When Los had been reassessed, the identification of
                        the Dead as victims of Urizen’s war became important to
                        Blake’s conception of Los’s redemptive activities. In VIII*,
                        for example, Los strives to assimilate the chaotic warfare: <q> Los builds
                            the walls of Golgonooza against the stirring battle<lb/> That only thro
                            the Gates of Death they can enter to Enitharmon.<lb/><lb/> (101:35-36)
                        </q> The pronoun "they" refers to "the Dead" who are
                        rescued by Los and Enitharmon as they descend towards the lowest level of
                        existence "tempted by the Shadowy females sweet / Delusive
                        cruelty." The descent described in VIIb thus became an integral part of
                        the process of redemption.</p>
          <p>However, in VIIb there is tension rather than cooperation between Los and
                        Enitharmon. Los responds enthusiastically to the violence, and Golgonooza
                        seems threatened by his neglect rather than strengthened by his efforts:
                        Enitharmon cries "O Los unless thou keep my tower the Watchman will be
                        slain" (98:6). In short, in VIIb the misguided Los contributes eagerly
                        to the chaos which, as an agent of redemption, he should be striving to
                        assimilate. When Los had been reassessed, then, part of VIIb became useful
                        to the developing scheme of salvation, while part became manifestly
                        inappropriate to that scheme. As long as the narrative of VIIb remained
                        unchanged between VIIal and the eighth Night, Blake would have difficulty in
                        introducing an account of Los’s enlightening reconciliation with the
                        Spectre and Enitharmon where it would be most appropriate—at the end
                        of VIIal.</p>
          <p>Another problem in introducing new material to the poem would be the
                        inevitable strain imposed on the general structure. The basic text of VIII*
                        had over 400 lines—about 100 more than any other Night except the
                        ninth; it had six leaves instead of five; and the text continued on the
                        verso of the sixth leaf, leaving no room for a full.-page drawing. In these
                        respects the Night was "irregular." Blake was being forced by the
                        quantity of his material to abandon some of the formal patterning which had
                        shaped his earlier Nights. However, the Night was transcribed on <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> proof pages in the normal way, and had
                        approximately the same number of lines per page as the earlier Nights on the
                        proof pages, which suggests that Blake still maintained some concern for the
                        general appearance of his manuscript, and was hoping to resolve the problem
                        of his two seventh Nights within a nine-Night structure. The desire to
                        preserve the formal structure of the poem obviously conflicted with the
                        desire to include growing quantities of new material, but Blake may have
                        maintained a fairly selective attitude towards new material at this
                        stage.</p>
          <p>The regularity of VIII* will be appreciated if it is compared with the two
                        leaves added at the end of VIIal, in which the reuinion of Los with the
                        Spectre and Enitharmon is described. These leaves, pages 87-90, were formed
                        by cutting in two a print (of <hi rend="i">Edward &amp; Elenor</hi>, 1793);
                        the text is written on one side of each leaf (with the print on the other
                        side), and the number of lines per page is considerably larger than the
                        average for the rest of the proof-text. The fact that the leaves were made
                        by destroying a large print would suggest that they were among the very last
                        to be added to the poem, used when Blake was having difficulty finding paper
                        of an appropriate size, and when the overall appearance of the manuscript
                        was less important to him than the inclusion of all relevant material.
                        However, with one or two local exceptions, the basic text of pages 87 and 90
                        seems to be contemporary in date of composition with those passages in VIII*
                        which describe the redemptive labors of Los and Enitharmon. Much of the
                        material added at the end of VIIal, then, may have been composed before, but
                        transcribed some time after, VIII* was transcribed.</p>
          <p>On page 85 Blake erased the original Night ending (of VIIal), adding nine
                        lines in which Los embraces the Spectre and gives up his "Domineering
                        Lust," and a new Night ending which was erased when the Night was
                        extended further. The final result of the later additions was a continuous
                        narrative from 85:32 to 90:68. Although as the poem now stands this
                        narrative <hi rend="i">is</hi> continuous, there is evidence to suggest that
                        it was originally composed and transcribed as two distinct sections designed
                        for separate contexts within the poem. The first section runs from 85:32 to
                        the foot of page 87 (line 59 in the basic text). The text from 85:32 to
                        86:14 is really a more elaborate version of the previous nine-line addition,
                        except that it describes Los’s reunion with the Spectre in terms
                        quite new to the poem, for Los now responds to the Spectre’s doctrine
                        of "Self annihilation." Golgonooza, previously featured in IV
                        (49:18-21), V (59:28; 60:1-3), and VIIb (97:31-32), now becomes prominent,
                        opening a way to "new heavens &amp; a new Earth" (87:9). In
                        87:30-35 the Spectre explains that Los’s task will be to ransom the
                        "Spectres of the Dead," a phrase which here refers to the dead who
                        burst from their tombs when Vala is reborn at the end of VIIal. But Los can
                        find no way to redeem the Spectres until he has been reconciled with
                        Enitharmon, an event which will complete the second stage of his
                        enlightenment. In 87:13-29 Enitharmon tempts Los with the fruit of
                        Urizen’s tree, and Los eats the fruit, sitting down "in
                        Despair." This passage ties the narrative firmly to that of VIIal, as
                        it continues the tension between Los and Enitharmon described on pages 81 to
                        85. The text of page 87 concludes with Enitharmon still possessed by jealous
                        fears, still refusing the entreaties of Los and misinterpreting the descent
                            <pb id="p12-127" n="127"/> of Christ: "I . . . fear that he / Will
                        give us to Eternal Death." At this point Los’s restoration is
                        incomplete, as he has yet to be reconciled with Enitharmon.</p>
          <p>Whereas the passage from 85:32 to 87:59 was clearly designed as a
                        continuation of VIIal, the basic text of page 90 may have been designed
                        originally for a different context. In 90:5-7 Los pleads once more with
                        Enitharmon: <q> Lovely delight of Men Enitharmon shady refuge from furious
                            war<lb/> Thy bosom translucent is a soft repose for the weeping
                            souls<lb/> Of those piteous victims of battle . . . </q> The references
                        to "war" and the "victims of battle" are explained when
                        Enitharmon is finally reassured by Los and they are reconciled: Los draws
                        flames "From out the ranks of Urizens war" (90:30). "Urizens
                        war" is the chaotic conflict which is described in VIIb and the eighth
                        Night. On page 90 the identification of the Spectres of the dead as victims
                        of this battle suggests that this passage may have been designed originally
                        for some context after the embrace of Vala and Orc, which in VIIb initiates
                        the conflict.</p>
          <p>On page 100 in VIII a marginal note "Los stood &amp;c" indicates
                        that a passage was to be inserted between lines 1 and 2. Erdman suggests
                        that this refers to 90:2, originally the first line on page 90, which
                        originally read "Los stood in Golgonooza in the Gate of Luban."
                        Erdman observes that "The thematic material of 90, amplified with
                        marginal additions, seems all an amplification backward from the
                        ‘Looms in Luban’s Gate’ in 100:2."<ref target="n84" type="note">23</ref> The suggestion of an
                        "amplification backward" follows from the observation that page 90
                        is "unquestionably a late addition." The physical evidence, we
                        have seen, would certainly suggest that pages 87 to 90 were among the last
                        additions to the poem, but this does not necessarily apply to the original
                        date of composition. From the internal evidence the material in VIII*
                        describing the labors of Los and Enitharmon seems to be a continuation of
                        the text of page 90. Los’s reunion with the Spectre and with
                        Enitharmon, and his discovery of a way to redeem the victims of
                        Urizen’s war, are assumed in VIII*, where there is no mention of the
                        Spectre, and where Los and Enitharmon start to rescue the Spectres of the
                        dead at the beginning of the Night. In fact, shortly after Los and
                        Enitharmon are introduced the focus of attention moves away from Los to the
                        building and working of Enitharmon’s looms. The shift in emphasis
                        seems quite natural if VIII* is read as a continuation of page 90, where
                        full attention is paid to Los’s role and Enitharmon, finally
                        reassured, begins to assume importance in the scheme of salvation. It seems
                        more likely that Blake worked out the details of Los’s reunion with
                        the Spectre and Enitharmon before VIII* was copied out, rather than
                        composing it afterwards as an "amplification backward." Old
                        Testament references occur in the three leaves added to VIII* (pages 113,
                        115, and 111) and in the added leaves pages 19-20, all of which also seem to
                        be unquestionably late additions, but there are no comparable references in
                        pages 87 and 90, which again suggests that the texts of the later pages may
                        have been composed before Blake had begun to adopt Old Testament references.

          <p>When Blake first reassessed the role of Los, he may have composed two related
                        but distinct passages: (i) a new ending to VIIa, describing the conversion
                        of Los by the new doctrine of "Self annihilation," which included
                        his reunion with the Spectre but did not resolve the tension between Los and
                        Enitharmon; (ii) a narrative designed to come after VIIb (i.e., to be
                        included in the eighth Night) which described Los’s reconciliation
                        with Enitharmon <hi rend="i">and</hi> the construction of
                        Enitharmon’s looms. By leaving the tension between Los and Enitharmon
                        unresolved in the new ending of VIIa, Blake may have hoped to explain the
                        strained relationship in VIIb, although the Spectre-like Los of VIIb is hard
                        to equate with the humanized Los of page 87, who has already begun his
                        inspired construction of Golgonooza. When Blake first composed this passage
                        he was possibly more concerned with developing the myth to his own
                        satisfaction than with the problem of containing it within the existing
                        structure of the poem.</p>
          <p>I have suggested that in his attempts to preserve the formal outline of the
                        poem Blake probably maintained a fairly selective attitude to new material.
                        In view of the fact that the new passages were developing beyond the
                        original scheme of the poem—could provide, in fact, the basis of a
                        separate poem—Blake may even have considered dropping VIIal from the
                        poem at this stage. A note on page 91 of VIIb reads, "This Night begins
                        at line 153 the following comes in at the End"; on page 95 after line
                        14 a note indicates the "Beginning of the <hi rend="i">Book</hi>
                        Seventh Night"; and at the foot of page 98 Blake wrote, "Then
                        follows Thus in the Caverns of the Grave &amp;c as it stands now in the
                        beginning of Night the Seventh." When he added these instructions he
                        clearly intended the seventh Night to begin at 95:15. The sixth Night ends
                        on page 75 with Urizen’s confrontation with Tharmas and the Spectre,
                        who impede his progress down the vale of Urthona. In the final lines of the
                        Night Urizen breaks down their resistance, as his "massy Globes . . .
                        slow oerwheel / The dismal squadrons of Urthona." Line 15 on page 95
                        would follow on quite well from this point as the beginning of the seventh
                        Night: <q> But in the Deeps beneath the <hi rend="i">tree</hi>
                            &lt;Roots&gt; of Mystery in darkest night<lb/> When Urizen sat
                            on his rock the Shadow brooded I <hi rend="i">dismal</hi><lb/> Urizen
                            saw &amp; triumphd &amp; he cried to <hi rend="i">the Shadowy
                                female</hi> &lt;his warriors&gt;<lb/> The time of Prophecy
                            is now revolvd &amp; all<lb/> This Universal Ornament is mine . .
                            .<lb/><lb/> (95:15-19) </q> The "Shadow" in line 16 was the
                        Shadowy female in the original context. If these lines followed from the end
                        of VI, however, "Shadow" would refer to the Spectre of Urthona,
                        who is called the "Shadow of Urthona" in 75:6, where the term was
                        altered from <pb id="p12-128" n="128"/> "Shade of Urthona,"
                        possibly to emphasize this identification. It may have been at this stage
                        that Blake deleted the last surviving reference to the Shadowy female, in
                        line 17, and substituted "his warriors." Urizen’s triumph
                        in lines 18 and 19 would thus be seen as the consequence of his victory over
                        Tharmas and the Spectre, and the chaotic warfare that follows would be seen
                        as a consequence of the confrontation at the end of VI. This may have been
                        the kind of transition Blake intended when he indicated that the seventh
                        Night began at 95:15.</p>
          <p>Blake’s instruction at the original beginning of VIIb clearly states
                        that "the following [i.e., 91:1 to 95:14] comes in at the end."
                        This portion continues the description of the chaotic conflict (but without
                        featuring Los or Enitharmon) and shows how the Shadowy female, stretching
                        through the fallen world, creates the conditions necessary for Los’s
                        redemptive activity in the eighth Night, as the dead descend on her clouds
                        to form Satan. The portion ends with the description of the descent of the
                        dead, which would lead appropriately into VIII*, on the first page of which
                        there is a similar passage (99:24-26).</p>
          <p>The transposed halves of VIIb, then, would link effectively with both the end
                        of VI and the beginning of the eight Night, and when he added the
                        instructions to indicate the transposition, he may have intended to exclude
                        VIIa1 from the poem. This, however, was probably only a temporary measure,
                        for the lengthy revisions in VIIa (i.e. the addition of VIIa2) show that
                        Blake decided to keep the Night after all.</p>
          <figure>
            <head><hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, p. 98 (detail).</head>
          </figure>
          <p>Rather than abandon VIIa1, or further unbalance the poem by introducing the
                        two new long passages describing the enlightenment of Los and Enitharmon, he
                        may have decided to edit the new passages in a drastic way. The nine lines
                        which formed the first new ending to VIIa may have been designed as an
                        alternative to the longer ending. The lines give a brief summary of
                        Los’s union with the Spectre without introducing any new terminology:
                        Los does not respond to the doctrine of Self annihilation, but simply to the
                        Shadow of Enitharmon’s "tale of Urthona." After the new
                        ending Blake wrote "The End of the Seventh Night" indicating that
                        he still thought of this as the seventh Night. The addition would therefore
                        supersede the instructions in VIIb, and might even imply that Blake had
                        decided to drop VIIb from the poem. The new ending would certainly introduce
                        an anomaly, as the Los of VIIb is almost an epitome of the "Domineering
                        Lust" which, in the new ending, he gives up. Perhaps he regarded the
                        new ending as a provisional measure, a concession to the new material he had
                        decided to exclude at this stage, written at a time when he had found no way
                        to reconcile the two seventh Nights.</p>
          <p>Of the second passage, designed for inclusion in the eighth Night, Blake
                        seems to have decided to introduce only a part at this stage—namely
                        the three passages describing the labors of Los and Enitharmon and the
                        weaving of a "Universal female form" identified as Jerusalem
                        (99:20 to 100:26, 101:35-36 and 103:32-39, 104:1-4). This is the culmination
                        of their redemptive labors, and relates their activity to the descent of
                        Christ, already described in the eighth Night. Lines 99:20-23, <pb id="p12-129" n="129"/> which as the manuscript now stands represent the
                        final stage in a gradual process of enlightenment, would have represented
                        the moment of enlightenment itself in the absence of the long additional
                        passages at the end of VIIa. All the references to "Ulro" in VIII*
                        are contained in the three passages describing the enlightened Los and
                        Enitharmon; Blake probably adopted the term at this stage. He also further
                        revised the central Christian sequence at this time, introducing first the
                        figure of Rahab (as the fragment page 145 shows), and then the song of the
                        females of Amalek which features Tirzah. At this stage, then, Blake’s
                        reading of the Old Testament began to influence the poem’s symbolism
                        more directly. Having introduced this song to the revised Christian
                        sequence, Blake transcribed VIII* on the proof-pages.</p>
          <p>The revision which in two stages transformed the original eighth Night into
                        VIII* reveals a growing tension between the wish to incorporate large
                        quantities of new material and the wish to preserve the poem’s
                        original structure; and there is evidence to suggest that Blake’s
                        symbolism was still developing rapidly when VIII* was composed. The song
                        which features Tirzah and the passage which introduces Rahab suggest that
                        Blake was trying to contain as concisely as possible a mythology which was
                        rapidly developing beyond the original myth of the poem. VIII* was not the
                        final product of this development, but represents an intermediate stage.</p>
          <p>Blake made two kinds of revisions to VIII*: (i) local modifications within
                        the original six leaves of the Night; (ii) additions contained on three
                        extra proof-leaves, pp. 111-12, 113-14 and 115-16. The three extra leaves
                        radically change the structure of the Night, but the first revisions to
                        VIII* were probably the local revisions designed to integrate more
                        satisfactorily the older and newer elements of the existing mythology,
                        without introducing any more new ideas. Three Christian additions in the
                        last section of VIII* have this function, updating part of the narrative
                        which contained no Christian references when it was copied out. At the
                        beginning of the Night an addition of twelve lines on page 99 describes the
                        double female form of the daughters of Beulah, mentioned in the first
                        addition at the end of IV. The narrative sequence was altered on pages 100
                        and 101, the passage 100:27-101:3 having a new context between lines 32 and
                        33 on page 101; and two additions on page 101 were probably made at this
                        time: a passage of five lines describing the appearance of Satan (written in
                        the margin without a guideline, but placed by Keynes and Erdman after
                        101:3), and five lines describing the labors of Los. The description of
                        Orc’s transformation into a jewelled serpent would now be followed by
                        the description of Urizen’s instruments of war, in which Urizen is
                        seen "Communing with the Serpent of Orc." The rearrangement
                        restores to Urizen’s battle-signal something of its original
                        significance, for it is now seen to have special consequences, intensifying
                        the conflict which begins to take the form of Satan. The new sequence also
                        suggests that the epiphany of Satan is the culmination of Orc’s
                        transformation and of the sinister communion between Urizen and Orc. The
                        added lines describing Los’s redemptive labors, by which the dead are
                        humanized, emphasize the opposition between Los’s effort and
                        Urizen’s military campaign which causes the dead to degenerate into
                        the form of Satan.</p>
          <p>These revisions make better or wider use of ideas which were already present
                        in VIII*. However, Blake undertook another series of revisions designed to
                        integrate the figure of Rahab more successfully into the Night, which led
                        eventually to major alterations. In the description of the crucifixion in
                        VIII* the daughters of Amalek, Canaan, and Moab were identified as different
                        forms of Rahab, and Rahab herself was identified as Mystery (who had been
                        introduced as a simple personification in the ninth Night). An addition at
                        105:11-24 attempts to account for the appearance of Rahab in the poem:
                        "The Synagogue Created her from Fruit of Urizens tree"; and the
                        addition was subsequently extended by three-and-a-half lines which explain
                        that she was "hidden within / The bosom of Satan," and that her
                        daughters are called Tirzah. Tirzah, who in VIII* had been introduced within
                        the song of the daughters of Amalek, now entered the main narrative, and her
                        relationship with Rahab was clarified. Other revisions probably made at
                        about the same time are the added line 105:13, which describes Vala hidden
                        in Satan’s bosom "as in an ark &amp; Curtains"; and, at
                        the foot of page 104, the last one-and-a-half lines, which were deleted and
                        replaced by a new account of the purpose of Christ’s incarnation:
                        "to Give his vegetated body / To be cut off &amp; separated that the
                        Spiritual body may be Reveald." With these revisions Blake was
                        apparently preparing to introduce the description of Rahab’s epiphany
                        after the revelation of Christ’s spiritual body, which had been
                        included in the fragment page 145, but excluded from VIII*. It was probably
                        after he had made these additions that he erased the original Night ending
                        of VIII* and added a new passage (110:30-37) in which he seems to have been
                        working towards a climactic conclusion describing the final epiphany of
                        Rahab before the revealed Christ. The passage was not finished, but was
                        deleted and replaced by a shorter passage (110:38-41) in which Los takes
                        Christ’s body from the cross and places it "in a Sepulcher which
                        Los had hewn / For himself." This action is repeated at the end of a
                        marginal addition on page 106 (7-16); and the new passage of thirteen lines
                        introduced on page 117, in the new beginning of the ninth Night, describes
                        how "Los &amp; Enitharmon builded Jerusalem weeping / Over the
                        Sepulcher &amp; over the Crucified body." Both of these revisions were
                        probably made when Blake revised the ending of VIII*.</p>
          <p>Clearly, Rahab was becoming increasingly important in this series of local
                        additions. The new passages show how she managed to absorb the crucifixion
                        in a religion of mystery. Los, Enitharmon, and Jerusalem weep over the
                        sepulchre, and their misunderstanding of Christ’s death is
                        Rahab’s triumph. When Blake added the new ending on page 110 he had
                        still not introduced a description of Rahab’s epiphany, although
                        Jerusalem weeps <pb id="p12-130" n="130"/> over the sepulchre "two
                        thousand years," suggesting a relationship between Rahab’s
                        triumph and contemporary history. This relationship is brought into focus in
                        the text of the added page 111. After explaining that St. John understood
                        the immediate absorption of Christ’s death into a religion of
                        mystery, the passage describes the rise of Natural Religion after the
                        Synagogue of Satan had resolved to burn Mystery: <q> The Ashes of Mystery
                            began to animate they calld it Deism<lb/> And Natural Religion as of old
                            so now anew began<lb/> Babylon again in Infancy Calld Natural
                            Religion.<lb/><lb/> (111:22-24) </q> This satanic second coming provides
                        the logical conclusion to the series of local additions made to VIII*, for
                        it is the final consolidation of error, the final epiphany of Rahab, and the
                        passage may have been added shortly after Blake made the final additions on
                        pages 110 and 117. The references to "Ahania weeping on the Void"
                        and to Enion speaking "from the Caverns of the Grave" indicate
                        that this text was designed for the end of the eighth Night, and when he
                        composed it Blake may have intended to add it at the foot of page 110 after
                        the second Night ending. He chose instead to transcribe it on a separate
                        leaf, the leaf which may originally have been intended for the end of VIIa
                        (the engraving of the sorrowful, pierced Christ on the recto of the leaf
                        would make an appropriate illustration for a text which describes how
                        Christ’s death was mis-interpreted). The text was first
                        pencilled—possibly Blake was hesitant about using up a near-exhausted
                        stock of proof-leaves for revisions of this kind-then it was inked, but
                        without a new Night ending at the foot of the page. By this time he had
                        added almost eighty new lines to VIII*, and the night now had seven leaves.
                        There would be little reason now not to include material which had
                        previously been exluded on grounds of economy in deference to the
                        poem’s structure. When page 111 was written he may have omitted a new
                        night ending because he intended, or felt that he might need, to add more
                        new material at the end of the Night. For some time the pressure of new
                        material had been gradually eroding the poem’s structure. At this
                        point it seems that Blake opened the flood-gates, and the original structure
                        was overwhelmed.</p>
          <p>In the manuscript as it now stands, the texts of pages 113-116 have been
                        interpolated into the eighth Night at two points: 113:1-39 is inserted on
                        page 104, in the song of the Sons of Eden; and 113:40-116:6 is inserted on
                        page 106 after the description of the crucifixion. Both passages have been
                        modified to suit their present contexts. The text on page 113 originally
                        began with an invocation to Blake’s muse, "Daughter of Beulah
                        describe . . . ," but this was subsequently changed to "We behold
                        with wonder" so that the narrative could become part of the song of the
                        Sons of Eden. The added line 24 beginning "We look down into Ulro . . .
                        " and the alteration in line 33 have the same effect. An ink line was
                        drawn after line 39, and the passage below the line was modified to
                        introduce Rahab, while on page 115 the third-person description in the basic
                        text was altered to become part of Los’s speech to Rahab. Before
                        these changes were made pages 113 and 115 may have formed a single
                        narrative, but it would have been a passage unlike the narrative of the rest
                        of the poem: it would have been a digression amplifying the main narrative
                        by providing an historical perspective. The description of the geography of
                        Golgonooza and Udan Adan, and the myth of Rintrah, Palamabron, and Satan
                        seem to be the result of independent experiments rather than developments
                        designed for a specific context in the poem. The pages have more lines of
                        text than any of the other proof-leaves used in the manuscript, which again
                        suggests that Blake’s stock of proofleaves was dwindling. Page 114
                        has a full-page engraving of the risen Christ, and page 116 has a full-page
                        drawing which may represent the risen Man. The illustrations may indicate
                        that the narrative was originally intended for the end of the eighth Night,
                        but as there is no Night ending on page 115, the pages may have been
                        interpolated in the rest of the Night shortly after they were
                        transcribed.</p>
          <p>Blake interpolated the pages by modifying the passages as we have said; by
                        adding a marginal direction after 104:10, "We behold with wonder
                        &amp;c," to indicate where 113:1-39 should be inserted; by adding a
                        note after the six lines at the top of page 116, "Darkness &amp;
                        sorrow &amp;c turn over leaf"; and by adding after 106:16 the
                        instruction, "But when Rahab &amp;c turn back 3 leaves." This
                        marked another departure from the regularity of the manuscript. Not only was
                        the length of the eighth Night further increased, but the leaves of the
                        manuscript were no longer in a strictly sequential order. In other words, at
                        this stage the manuscript was beginning to look more like a rough draft than
                        a fair copy. There would be little reason now not to make any other major
                        alterations that seemed necessary by annotating existing leaves instead of
                        recopying the revised text; and there would be little reason not to include
                        material previously excluded to preserve the shape of the poem. In short,
                        there would be little reason to exclude the full account of Los’s
                        enlightenment, and Blake probably decided to introduce this material after
                        he had added pages 113-16.</p>
          <p>He seems to have used up his last <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> proofs in
                        pages 113-16, for to accommodate the new material about Los he had to cut a
                        large print of <hi rend="i">Edward &amp; Elenor</hi> in two. When he used
                        these sheets he may still have intended to introduce the account of
                        Los’s enlightenment as two separate passages. Erdman notes that
                        "90:1 is probably an addition, the text originally starting within the
                        platemark"—and it is this line that now links the narratives of
                        pages 87 and 90. Line 90:2 originally began "Los stood in Golgonooza .
                        . . " and between lines 1 and 2 on page 100 in the eighth Night a
                        marginal note, "Los stood &amp;c," calls for an insertion which,
                        as Erdman notes, "probably refer[s] to 90:2 before revision."
                        Erdman concludes that "Blake wrote the <pb id="p12-131" n="131"/><figure><head><hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, p. 116.</head></figure><pb id="p12-132" n="132"/><figure><head><hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, p. 115.</head></figure> two pages 87 and 90 as a sequence, considered using the second
                        page as a second page for Night VIII (i.e. inserting it on p 100), but then
                        chose to tighten the sequence (with additions at the bottom of 87 and top of
                        90) and insert it (unquestionably a late addition) at the end of
                            VII."<ref target="n85" type="note">24</ref> However, when Blake
                        added 90:1 he may have been creating rather than tightening a sequence, and
                        as originally transcribed page 90 may have been intended as an addition to
                        the eighth Night, to be interpolated like pp. 113, 115, and 116. (The
                        reference to Rintrah and Palamabron in 90:45-58 may have been introduced as
                        the page was transcribed to account for the appearance of these characters
                        in the myth described on page 115.) <note id="n85"><hi rend="s">24</hi>

          <p>We have seen that although VIIb seems to follow logically from the end of
                        VIIal, the scenes describing the tension between Los and Enitharmon would
                        seem completely out of place if made to follow an account of their
                        enlightened reunion. This may be why the description of the reunion on page
                        90 was originally designed for inclusion in the eighth Night. When Blake
                        moved page 90 from VIII to the end of VIIa, he must have felt that he had
                        overcome this problem. Presumably, when he moved the page, he had decided to
                        drop VIIb from the poem, thus removing the anomaly.</p>
          <p>As we have seen, he may have considered removing VIIb earlier, when he added
                        the first new ending of nine lines to VIIa. But the fact that VIIb has
                        survived in the manuscript suggests that Blake was never finally committed
                        to excluding it, although he left no indication of how the Night should be
                        fitted into the poem. However, as VIIb had been rearranged so that the
                        second half (95:15-98:31) would follow on directly from VI, and the first
                        half (91:1-95:14) would lead into the eighth Night, it is possible to
                        conflate the two versions of the seventh Night simply by inserting the whole
                        of VIIa between the transposed halves of VIIb. The scenes describing the
                        tension between Los and Enitharmon would thus be placed in a context which
                        would allow a relatively coherent narrative sequence to develop, describing
                        a steady progress in the relationship of Los and Enitharmon, from disharmony
                        to unity.</p>
          <p>We have already seen how the transition from VI to 95:15 would work. The new
                        beginning of the seventh Night would describe Urizen’s initial
                        triumph over Tharmas and the Spectre (following their confrontation at the
                        end of VI), the preparations for Urizen’s Universal Empire, Los and
                        Tharmas rallying to the battle, the consequent degeneration of Los’s
                        relationship with Enitharmon, and the universal conflict of the natural
                        world: <q> sullen the wooly sheep<lb/> Walks thro the battle Dark &amp;
                            fierce the Bull his rage<lb/> Propagates thro the warring Earth the Lion
                            raging in flames<lb/> The Tyger in redounding smoke.<lb/><lb/>
                            (98:17-20) </q> The transition from this part of VIIb to the beginning
                        of VIIa would be assisted by the similarities between the lines above and
                        77:6-9. Urizen, having conducted his preparations while sitting on a rock
                        (95:16) now rises, causing Tharmas and the Spectre to flee once more.
                        Leaving the battle, Urizen descends to the caves of Orc. After the
                        confrontation with Orc, the narrative focuses on the disordered relationship
                        of Los and Enitharmon. Vala is reborn, and is given charge over the howling
                        Orc, an event which underlines the urgency of the problem of
                        Urthona’s divided personality. On page 87 the narrative continues
                        with an account of Los’s reunion first with the Spectre and then with
                        Enitharmon. After the reconciliation (on page 90), which sets another part
                        of the scheme of redemption in motion, the narrative would return to the
                        confrontation between Vala and Orc, prepared for in 85:22. VIIb pages 91-95
                        would follow effectively from the end of VIIa2. On page 90 Tharmas is
                        heartened by the first signs of recovery: <q> But Tharmas most rejoicd in
                            hope of Enions return<lb/> For he beheld new Female forms born forth
                            upon the air<lb/><lb/> (90:55-56) </q> But in pages 91-95, after Vala
                        has embraced Orc she mocks this hope and attempts to deceive Tharmas
                        (94:12-23), while the Dead descend upon her clouds and begin to take up the
                        form of Satan, thus preparing for the epiphany of Satan in the eighth
                        Night.</p>
          <pb id="p12-133" n="133"/>
          <p>This arrangement produces a seventh Night of about 790 lines, compared with
                        about 620 in the eighth Night and about 850 in the ninth Night. The total
                        sequence is inevitably rather disjointed, but Blake had used a comparable
                        patchwork method when composing VIIb and VIII. Furthermore, the arrangement
                        tends to reduce serious anomalies in the text rather than create them.</p>
          <p>It seems that here, as elsewhere in the poem, Blake did not finally complete
                        his revisions. We have no authority for this textual arrangement, but
                        neither do we have authority to exclude VIIb from the poem. As I said at the
                        beginning of this article, the problem compels editorial choice of an
                        uncomfortable kind. I suggest we adopt an arrangement which includes all the
                        available material necessary for a full understanding of the poem, and which
                        introduces order to the narrative.</p>

        <p>The strongest evidence that VIIb is an essential part of the poem, and of
                    "Night the Seventh," is the way its incidents fulfill structural
                    patterns established in the preceding Nights. The fall from oneness is initiated
                    in "Night the First," the imprisonment of the Eternal Man in
                    "Night the Fourth," and the rise toward salvation in "Night the
                    Seventh." The central problem of the poem, Urthona’s division, is
                    emphasized in these three Nights in the repeated motif of Urthona suddenly alone
                    beside his anvil (compare I, 22:16-18; IV, 50:6-10; VIIa, 84:16-17), and in the
                    evolving relationships among Tharmas, Los, and Enitharmon. Without VIIb there
                    would be serious gaps in the development; yet the continuities are broken if we
                    read VIIa and VIIb either in simple sequence or in reverse order.</p>
        <p>The arrangement I propose requires inserting VIIb (with its two parts reversed,
                    as Blake’s instructions require) between the original and added parts of
                    VIIa (i.e. between VIIa1 and VIIa2). In this sequence "Night the
                    Seventh" can function coherently as the crucial Night of the poem. It
                    begins with the successful machinations of Urizen to dominate the world. In
                    VIIa1 he lays his plot, hoping to overcome Los through Orc and Enitharmon; in
                    VIIb2 he routs Orc in a terrific battle; in VIIb1 his agent deceives Tharmas and
                    the nadir of the Fall is reached. In VIIa2 the poem makes the crucial upswing
                    toward salvation, and Los is the zoa in control.</p>
        <p>This rearrangement changes the complexion of VIIb. It no longer serves to
                    initiate the harmony which is achieved in "Night the Ninth." It now
                    serves to emphasize the action in "Night the Seventh." Placed after
                    VIIa1 it interrupts the action at a critical point and holds the reader in
                    suspense over the outcome of the birth of the "wonder horrible."
                    During this short interval the rest of the main characters are deployed in their
                    appropriate positions for the climactic events of VIIb1 (the battle) and VIIa2
                    (the ascendance of Los). VIIb2 serves this purpose well because it contains a
                    short account of each character’s situation at the time of Vala’s
                    birth, thus enabling Blake to orchestrate the final movement of the poem.</p>
        <p>A further indication that this arrangement (VIIa1, VIIb2, VIIb1, VIIa2) is the
                    most sensible reading is the way each section fits into those next to it and the
                    rest of the poem. VIIa1 takes up the narrative at the end of "Night the
                    Sixth" so smoothly that this order has never been interrupted in any
                    editions of the poem. VIIb2 does not follow VIIa1 as nicely, but Urizen’s
                    opening response ("Urizen saw &amp; triumphed": 95:17) could easily
                    be to Vala’s birth at the end of VIIa1 (85:7,22). Urizen would certainly
                    have cause to exult, since he believes the birth to be the successful result of
                    his plot.</p>
        <p>The two parts of VIIb do not mesh as well as before Blake reversed them, but
                    there is some textual evidence that Blake made the reversal precisely for the
                    purpose of placing VIIb2 as the sequel to VIIa1, namely the substitution of
                    "his warriors" for "the Shadowy Female" in 95:17 and the
                    erasure of the original 95:25, "The shadowy voice answered 0 Urizen Prince
                    of Light." In the original order this was intended as Vala’s reply
                    to Urizen.</p>
        <p>Stronger support for keeping the revised sequence of VIIb2, 1 can be found in the
                    way VIIb1 leads into the events of VIIa2. In 95:4-7 the daughters of Beulah
                    invoke the Eternal Promise: "If ye will believe your Brother shall rise
                    again." The first words of the spectre to Los at the beginning of VIIa2
                    recognize that promise (85:43-86:3). The final transition, from VIIa2 to
                    "Night the Eighth," is smooth enough, although there is little to
                    indicate that VIIa2 must directly precede it. The opening lines of VIII could
                    follow just about anything, since they open a new scene. It is appropriate,
                    however, that the scene opens after Los has reinstituted love and unity in the
                    world. If we agree that the transitions from section to section from VI to VIIa2
                    make the most sense, then the absence of a signaled transition to VIII should
                    not trouble us.</p>

        <p>Henry James managed to overlook typographical errors in his text while
                    concentrating on the serious business of removing commas which the printers had
                    inserted (and some of his own).<ref target="n86" type="note">1</ref> William
                    Blake while revising and reorganizing his text managed to overlook cumbrous
                    redundancies—two "Chap: IV" headings in <hi rend="i">The Book
                        of Urizen</hi>, two of "Night the Seventh" in <hi rend="i">The
                        Four Zoas.</hi> Neither writer should be thought to have
                    "abandoned" his works. Perhaps Blake as his own printer (or scribe)
                    might have settled the fate of all those dangling insertions and the two chapter
                    headings if he had lived to inscribe one more fair copy. We shall never know.
                    And we tend to forget that we cannot know how many drafts and revisions and fair
                    copies were made and discarded before the assembling and inscription of the
                    surviving manuscript of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, although it is built on
                    the remains of several fair copies beginning with the one dated "1797"
                    and patched even after the etching of his other epics. When we come upon the
                    insertion of a reference to annihilation of the Selfhood, we may think we are
                    witnessing the dawn of that concept in Blake’s mind: we should allow for
                    the possibility that he had already written his <hi rend="i">Milton.</hi> When
                    we debate whether to move the parts or the wholes of the two Nights the Seventh
                    from their positions "in the manuscript," we forget that Blake did not
                    number his pages (beyond "14" in the first Night) and that the
                    manuscript was a heap of unbound and unsorted sheets when the Linnell brothers
                    lent it to the first editors, Ellis and Yeats. "An attempt had been made to
                    put it in order, but without success," records Ellis. "The arrangement
                    of the loose sheets occupied us during several long days" (<hi rend="i">The

        <p>It has been traditional to scoff at the editorial casualness of Ellis and Yeats,
                    whose transcription of Blake’s words is full of howlers. It has not been
                    recognized that the sequence of pages we accept today is pretty much that
                    established by Ellis’s arrangement, not over those several days but over
                    several years. Many of the sequences were fairly easy to discover, with the help
                    of Blake’s occasional catchwords, his handwriting sizes, his counting of
                    lines by tens and fifties and by Nights, as well as the frequently incontestable
                    narrative flow. But most of these aids are lacking for the area of the present
                    investigation. Here editors are often entirely on their own, attempting by
                    conjectural leaps and plodding deductions to trace the intentions of the
                    apocalyptic imagination. Bentley’s conclusion (p. 197) that each editor
                    is "at liberty to rearrange the leaves as seems best" cannot be taken
                    as a serious generalization, but is practically operative for Night VII. How did
                    the two Nights the Seventh survive? Were they together when Blake turned over
                    the heap of unbound separate leaves (half-sheets) to John Linnell? Had he placed
                    some leaves at the bottom of the pile?</p>
        <p>Let us consider what Ellis found for evidence of order in the manuscript pages of
                    what we are calling VIIa2. The three leaves bearing the pages now numbered
                    85-86, 87, 90 (in our editions, not in the manuscript) were not found where we
                    think they belong. Ellis at one stage considered pages 87 and 90 as part of
                    "5th N[ight]" and tried p. 87 as "p 3" and p. 90 as "p
                    4" of that Night. Later, assembling the leaves bearing pages 90, 87, and
                    86, facing versos up and in that order, Ellis numbered them 1, 2, 3 and queried
                    the first (p. 90) "?fragment 7th (1)." Before press time Ellis and
                    Yeats had assembled and paginated the first ten pages of VIIa and had discovered
                    that the text on 86 (their page 10) follows from the text on the other side,
                    i.e. 85 (their page 9).<ref target="n87" type="note">2</ref> Subsequent editors
                    (perhaps Ellis in the first place) confirmed the sequence of pages 77 through 85
                    by Blake’s own line-counting—but not quite. Margoliouth and
                    Bentley noticed evidence of a potential gap between 84 and 85, but quickly
                    dismissed it. Blake’s pencilled line-count at the bottom of p. 84
                    ("292 or 297": the poet hesitating whether to keep or cancel five
                    lines of his marginal insertion preceding the last two lines of the page) must
                    signify, judging from his other totals at <pb id="p12-136" n="136"/> ends of
                    Nights, that he considered 84:42 as the end of a Night; there is certainly
                    sufficient cadence. Much later (according to Margoliouth and Bentley)
                    Blake’s numbering in ink by fifties produced a line-count of
                    "350" (mended, however, from "370") alongside line 12 of p.
                    85 (line 8 before insertion of lines 1-4). When Blake made that count he had
                    extended the Night beyond the 292 or 297 lines of pages 77-84, presumably on an
                    intervening leaf containing from 46 to 71 lines (depending on how many of the
                    inserted lines on 84 and 85 he included in his count). The insertion of 85:1-4
                    could have been made to bridge the gap made by removal of the leaf. Margoliouth
                    simply notes that "no lacuna is indicated by the sense" (but of
                    course) and rules that "Blake’s ‘350’ must be meant
                    for ‘300’." His confidence derives from the consideration
                    that "a lacuna would mean a whole leaf missing with 50 lines (far too few
                    for two pages)"—and from neglect of the fact that some pages have
                    pictures (76, for instance) that take up space. Bentley (pp. 199, 204) repeats
                    the argument: "a missing leaf would probably have about seventy lines on
                    it." Neither Bentley nor Margoliouth was influenced by the mending of the
                    numeral from 370 to 350, which they did not observe.<ref target="n88" type="note">3</ref> Confident that there can’t be 50 lines missing
                    because there would have to be 70, Bentley fails to consider that Blake could
                    have written 70 lines and cancelled 20. Blake’s way of working must often
                    have resulted in leaves removed or moved to other positions. I have no
                    hypothesis about the missing leaf, but perhaps Andrew Lincoln can evolve one
                    that suits his hypothetical reconstruction of the movements of parts of Night
                    the Seventh. <note id="n87"><hi rend="s">2</hi> The Ellis and Yeats edition,
                            1893, numbers lines Night by Night and does not indicate manuscript
                            pages, but the textual sequence is that of the first pencilled series of
                            folio numbers in the manuscript, running from 1 to 68. The texts of pp.
                            15-16 and 111 are given in an Appendix of "fragments." Some
                            indication of the ordering problems faced by Ellis and Yeats is given by
                            the queries on the leaves of VIIa2 trying them for Night V, then as a
                            misplaced "fragment" of VII, and by the numbering of some
                            Nights by leaves ("sheets") and by pages. Night V apparently
                            gave difficulty, with some sheets facing wrong side up; the only number
                            on the proper 4th page is "6" (p. 60) and p. 62 was once
                            numbered "5" then "6"—possibly when pp. 87
                            and 90 were queried "5th N p. 3" and "5th N p. 4."
                            The 9th page has "8" changed to "9." Finally the
                            proper sequence of leaves 2-5 was marked as "sh2," "Sht
                            3," "sht 4," and "5th sheet," in pencil notes
                            (partly erased) that seem to cite "cat. Ellis": perhaps Ellis
                            had made some sort of catalogue of sheets which could be consulted when
                            reshuffling had caused disarray. (It must have been later that these
                            five leaves were <hi rend="i">heavily</hi> designated "Book 5 Page
                            1" etc., with "Book" only twice corrected to
                            "Night"—or can these heavy markings have been
                            Blake’s own, whose heading for this Night first read
                            "Book"? The g’s are more like Ellis’s, but I am
                            uncertain.)
                        <p>Night VI was also marked by sheets, 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th, correctly, but
                            only the first three pages were given numbers: did doubts remain, or had
                            the problem vanished? Night VIIa was paginated up through "11"
                            (p. 87) and "VII" was written beside Ellis’s "?7th
                            (3)" query. Ellis queried "?what night?" at the top of p.
                            97, but by press-time had taken the plunge of including the sequence we
                            think of as VIIa and VIIb as a single Night. We do not know where the
                            parts had been found—except that they had not been found together
                            and that VIIa1 and a2 had not been together.</p><p>It was not hard to see "what night’ p. 97 belonged to, since
                            its verso bears the unerased legend "End of The Seventh
                            Night," and we find a revealing outcry in Ellis &amp; Yeats (III,
                            173): "Line 786 [95:14] is the only possible end of Night VII"
                            (accepting the transposition of the halves of VIIb). This declaration
                            solved the editorial problem, and pp. 78-98 were printed as a continuous
                            Night. But the failure to paginate VIIb may indicate lingering
                            reservations.</p><p>Night VIII presented no difficulty, except that leaves 56 and 57 were not
                            included in the text until after page numbering—and that the
                            concluding page was not numbered. Night IX has page numbers that only
                            begin with "5" but run correctly to "20" but then
                            jump to "27" followed by "27," again, with no number
                            on the final page.</p><p>How can we be sure that Edwin J. Ellis wrote these queries? For one
                            thing, they clearly precede the ordering decisions reflected in the 1893
                            edition. For another, Ellis identifies the handwriting by initialing and
                            dating a longish note on page 15: "(a separate sheet. It cannot be
                            placed as its sequel is missing.)—E J E—1891." The
                            letters, especially the g and t, are distinctive and are identical to
                            those in the word "fragment" on p. 90. Thirteen years later
                            Ellis adds a further note below it: "Perhaps it is all an insertion
                            designed to preceed ‘Enion blind &amp; age bent wept upon the
                            desolate wind, [line] 373,—in the 1st printed numbering [i.e. the
                            1893 text]—Suggestion of Mr. F G Fleay 1904" (i.e. Frederick
                            Gerard Fleay, 1831-1909, editor and poet). These notes tell us why pp.
                            15-16 were kept at the end of the Ellis-Yeats text as
                            "fragments" (along with p. 111, also unplaced). And apparently
                            Fleay’s suggestion was too late for the Ellis 1906 edition, in
                            the press by 1904. Actually both pp. 15-16 and p. 111 remain in the
                            Keynes <hi rend="i">Bibliography</hi> (1921) as "additional leaves
                            and fragments" foliated "69" and "70." Sloss
                            and Wallis finally put both these stray leaves into proper places though
                            they continued some of the confusion of sequences in Nights I and II.
                            For example, the order now accepted, of pp. 18, 21-22, 19-20, was
                            arrived at by much editorial agony. If Ellis had managed, accidentally
                            or with care, to put the leaves in that order, subsequent editors
                            instead of weighing and reasoning might have felt they were merely
                            "retaining the manuscript order."</p><p>Perhaps it should be noted that the pencil foliation that runs from 1 to
                            68 corresponds to the Ellis-Yeats sequences, while the revision that
                            runs to 70 is made after insertion of pp. 15-16 as folio 8 and of pp.
                            111-12 as folio 56, with the numbers moved forward one after
                            "8" and two after "56."</p></note><note id="n88"><hi rend="s">3</hi> Margoliouth (p. 133) does note the mending

        <p>Until getting involved in the present discussion, which has been going on for a
                    couple of years, I tended to assume that leaving the manuscript "as it
                    was" meant accepting the order VIIa, VIIb. I have come to realize that
                    there is even less evidence for doing that than for relegating one Night the
                    Seventh to the bottom of the pile. There is evidence, we see, for concluding
                    that Blake, with at least temporary intent, sidetracked VIIb when he inserted
                    VIIa2 as a firm piece of masonry fitting VIIa directly to VIII.<ref target="n89" type="note">4</ref> There is also evidence, in the fact that Ellis found
                    pages 85-90 not obviously "in" Night the Seventh at all, that Blake
                    may have removed the masonry unit of pp. 85-90 (all of 7a2 and its bridge from
                    7a1) to leave open a sequence from 84 to 91—or to 99. Ellis does not give
                    page numbers to the pages of 7b and clearly did not find it "in place"
                    either. What finally decided Ellis and Yeats was there being only one terminal
                    rubric "End of The Seventh Night," the one on p. 98. We all seem to
                    agree that no part of VIIb nor VIIa should be discarded. Blake left no
                    instructions—to himself or posterity—for their arrangement, and
                    those of us who have become familiar enough with the text to face the problem of
                    its arrangement already "have" both Nights, whatever order we read
                    them in. The editorial problem remains: to choose a sequence which will work
                    best, in the context of the whole poem, for the new or the occasional
                        reader.<ref target="n90" type="note">5</ref><note id="n89"><hi rend="s">4</hi> A misreading by Wagenknecht, followed by

                        a bit of masonry makes for some mirth at that lunatic Erdman who sees
                        masonry in a misfitting conjecture (they take me to refer to possible use of
                        87-90 as an insert on p. 100). I didn’t, of course. But I do write

                        arms around stone tablets . . . and a bearded priest . . . "; I seemed
                        to be saying that the arms were around the tablets only! (<hi rend="i">The

        <p>My editorial self has been moved by the present discussion, further homework, and
                    discussions with John Grant and Harold Bloom, to abandon those non-solutions,
                    the relegating of VIIb to a postscript or the printing of VIIa and VIIb in
                    tandem. Neither arrangement responds adequately to the manuscript or to the
                    reader’s appreciation of an inclusive yet coherent narrative or thematic
                    sequence or structure. As the search for Blake’s "final
                    intentions" disappoints us, we arrive at the idea that the best editorial
                    service will be to place VIIb in the most effective location within the flow of
                    the text. Even the graphic evidence contradicts itself: Blake left two
                    ornamentally lettered headings, "Vala / Night the Seventh"—but
                    he left, as Ellis noted, only one "End of the Seventh Night," at the
                    conclusion not of VIIa but of VIIb! Perhaps the greatest liberty to be taken in
                    accepting the textual masonry cementing VIIa to VIII will be our snatching the
                    finis line from page 98.<ref target="n91" type="note">6</ref> Ellis’s
                    point was in justification, not of printing two Nights Seventh but of conflating
                    them as one. <note id="n91"><hi rend="s">6</hi> No editor, so far as I know, has
                        felt guilty about ignoring Blake’s own page numbering in copies of

                        restore the rejected Plate 4. Incidentally, my note on p. 727 contains a
                        howling non sequitur. In support of the hypothesis that Plate 8 was designed
                        to replace Plate 10, I argue that in two copies the lines on Plate 10 that
                        contain the refrain words "first Age" are marked for erasure. The
                        evidence rather supports the contrary view, as I ought to have seen, that
                        Plate 10 was meant to be <hi rend="i">kept.</hi> I report this somewhat in
                        the spirit of Charles Lamb hissing his own farce.</note></p>
        <p>To return to the specific analyses and hypotheses about the two Nights, I should
                    like to sum up my understanding of the arguments by using a compact symbolism
                    without further verbalizing—with Arabic numerals (6, 7, 8 instead of VI,
                    VII, VIII) and the following sigla: <q><hi rend="s">°</hi> = original fitting in fair-copy, or a linkage
                        directed by Blake<lb/> + = a more or less good fit<lb/> ! = an abrupt jump
                        (such as Blake created when he transposed 7b1 <hi rend="s">°</hi> 2
                        to 7b2 ! 1)<lb/> ? = a bad fitting, what Kilgore calls "a bewildering
                        non sequitur" </q></p>
        <p>As I understand Lincoln’s reconstruction, there was once this sequence,
                    before revisions: 6 <hi rend="s">°</hi> 7a1 <hi rend="s">°</hi>
                    7b1 <hi rend="s">°</hi> 7b2 <hi rend="s">°</hi> (+) 8. There was
                    never the bewildering non sequitur either of 6 ?! 7b1 or of 7b2 ? 7a1. Then,
                    when Blake transposed the halves of 7b, by his inked instructions, a fairly
                    abrupt but obviously tolerated linkage resulted: 7b2 <hi rend="s">°</hi>!
                    7b1, the aim perhaps being to link 6 + 7b2 ! 7b1 + 8 and to eliminate 7a, which
                    consisted entirely of 7a1. The reversal made a poor linkage of 7b1 ? 7a1, if he
                    meant to retain 7a between 7b and 8; on the other hand 6 <hi rend="s">°</hi> 7a1 + 7b2 was not impossible. But then Blake added 7a2,
                    confirming the retention of 7a but making a place for it problematic What were
                    the possibilities? To retain 7b with either part of 7a would be difficult.</p>
        <p>6 + 7b2 ! 7b1 ? 7a1 <hi rend="s">°</hi> 8 would produce a bad
                    sequitur.</p>
        <p>More successful would have been the sequence 6 + 7b2 ! 7b1 + 7a2 + 8, although
                    the tidiest set of transitions (disregarding structural omissions) would have
                    been: 6 <hi rend="s">°</hi> 7a1 <hi rend="s">°</hi> 7a2 + 8,
                    dropping 7b altogether.</p>
        <p>Blake shows no signs of having considered the proposals that are now being made
                    in the interest of incorporating, somehow, the indispensable 7b: <q>
                        Lincoln’s suggestion: 6 + 7b2 ? 7a1 <hi rend="s">°</hi> 7a2 ?
                        7b1 + 8.<lb/> Kilgore’s main suggestion: 6 <hi rend="s">°</hi>
                        7a1 <hi rend="s">°</hi> 7b1 <hi rend="s">°</hi> 7b2 ! 7a2 +
                        8.<lb/> Lefebvre’s suggestion: 6 <hi rend="s">°</hi> 7a1 + 7b2
                            <hi rend="s">°</hi>! 7b1 + 7a2 + 8. </q><pb id="p12-137" n="137"/> Lincoln would revise the ? between 7a2 and 7b1 to !
                    by restoring the word "Now" to 91:1 (which Blake may have misquoted as
                    "Thus"). The sequence he proposes makes good sense as a conclusion
                    from his analysis of the probable evolution of the extant texts. And it
                    preserves the linkage made by Blake when he added 7a2 to 7a1, while it only
                    moves further apart the halves of 7b which Blake had already rearranged. But the
                    proposal to fit VIIb between the two parts of VIIa seems to make the better
                    reading sequence. Between the Kilgore alternative, to restore b1 and b2 to their
                    earlier order, and the Lefebvre alternative, to retain the reversed order called
                    for in the manuscript, I incline to prefer the latter as doing the least
                    injustice to the claims of narrative and the manuscript evidence. And on that
                    point Kilgore agrees, if we are talking about a published edition.<ref target="n92" type="note">7</ref> Harold Bloom, whose Commentary (as he
                    points out) will work quite well when rearranged, agrees with me that most
                    people reading the poem will find it more available in this form—and that
                    no editorial handling, in any case, can possibly acquaint the reader with the
                    full nature of the editorial problem, let alone the "manuscript
                    evidence." Perhaps it tells us something about the sequences of the text,
                    as well as about Bloom’s Commentary, that we can easily see that
                    rearranging will cause no difficulty and, indeed, will give the reader a
                    stronger epic sequence. "You must state, though," says he, "that
                    we really do not know how Blake perceived narrative continuity, how much
                    departure from the Homeric norm he felt comfortable with." Ault’s
                    theory, that Blake as it were got a twentieth-century charge out of narrative
                    discontinuities, is of course somewhat anachronistic.<ref target="n93" type="note">8</ref> Mitchell is perhaps closer to Blakean thinking when he
                    argues that "Blake intentionally designed <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> to
                    allow only an approximate sense of structural orientation" as, in part, a
                    rhetorical strategy.<ref target="n94" type="note">9</ref> Not that <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> have the same shape;
                    nine Nights are round and they revolve, while four Chapters reverberate. <note id="n92"><hi rend="s">7</hi> What I have called Kilgore’s main
                        suggestion is what he recommends as "a critical order" to be
                        followed in reading, the order used by Wagenknecht. Kilgore would, however,
                        "print VIIb in the reversed order." When he is considering a
                        printed text he is guided by the policy of "following the latest
                        intentions for which there is direct evidence in the manuscript"; when
                        recommending the original order, for reading, he is guided by a suspicion
                        "that the reordering of the Night corresponded to a plan of revision
                        which Blake never carried out." These are proper distinctions. I find
                        myself concurring (for a printed text) with the "direct evidence"
                        rather than the suspicion; what I am less certain is that presenting <hi rend="i">each</hi> Night Seventh as a unit must be "undoubtedly
                        correct." The discussion, the evidence and the considerations brought
                        forward, have inclined me to doubt that Blake’s manuscript, not known
                        to have been in its present bound order, makes it feasible to present each
                        of the two Nights Seventh "as a unit" while attempting to preserve
                        the unity of the entire poem as comprised of nine Nights.</note><note id="n93"><hi rend="s">8</hi> Donald Ault, "Incommensurability and

                        wisdom in Ault’s analysis of what is happening in <hi rend="i">The
                            Four Zoas.</hi> "The basic formula . . . is: incommensurability
                        does not entail disconnection; and interconnection does not entail
                        unity" (298). "From the opening of the poem Blake has been
                        striving to dissolve a solid framework right before our eyes. . . . The
                        final version [of Night the First] frustrates all attempts at causal
                        connection by deleting the predicate forms which allow the language to be
                        divided into causally related phrases" (299). Even so, Night I, heavily
                        and rather carelessly patched (to judge by Blake’s general practive
                        elsewhere in the poem), is a special case, not altogether relevant here; and
                        Ault at times misreads to find his "inversion or reversal of narrative
                        ‘facts’"—as in the evidence he produces on p. 282
                        from pages 4 and 22. Tharmas’ saying that he bears pity to
                        Enitharmon, who "hath taken refuge in my bosom" (p. 4) will appear
                        to be reversed on p. 22, "And Tharmas took her in pitying," only
                        if the reader chooses to misconstrue by attaching the "pitying" to
                        Enitharmon and not Tharmas. A witty fellow can do this with many a text but
                        cannot convince us that the author or his contemporary reader would have
                        faltered into such misprision.</note><note id="n94"><hi rend="s">9</hi> W. J. T. Mitchell, <hi rend="i">Blake’s Composite Art</hi> (Princeton University Press, 1978),

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>The question of the earliness or lateness of VIIa "taken as a
                        whole" has been quite sufficiently flogged, but I feel some
                        responsibility for the confusion. My note at the head of VIIa should not
                        have read "Written later than and presumably to replace Night Seven
                        b" but something like this: "Nights VIIa and VIIb were at one
                        stage a continuous pair of chapters with identical titles. Additions were
                        made to VIIa (on pp 85-90) which linked it directly with VIII. Blake left no
                        instructions for relocating VIIb; it is here given following IX." But
                        once the discussion gets down to the lateness of VIIa1 <hi rend="s">°</hi> 2, most of the disagreement vanishes. As Kilgore says,
                        ceasing his heavy fire, "the traditional account . . . may not be so
                        far mistaken after all. . . . Thus VIIa [he means 7a1] though not originally
                        a replacement for VIIb, would have become one by the time Blake finished his
                        revisions [i.e. added a2]." Q.E.D. He even comes round
                        "tentatively" to the thought that "Blake changed the order of
                        VIIb before writing [VIIa2]." So we can "break through" to
                        where the discussion should have begun. I cannot believe that
                        Margoliouth’s observation of the narrative continuity of a1 <hi rend="s">°</hi> b1 was news to anyone working on the text; I find
                        no excitement about it in his correspondence with me when he was preparing
                        his edition. The textual question was whether Blake’s revisions
                        culminated in a "structure which Blake finally left . . . with VIIb
                        lounging somewhere in the shadows" (Kilgore’s language as he
                        puts up his sword).</p>
          <p>The stitch-mark argument is threadbare now; as Kilgore says, one hypothesis
                        "is not more convincing" than the other; neither accounts for the
                        narrative continuity, which in either case can be accounted for by several
                        hypotheses. That was my point in my "Binding" review of
                        Bentley’s <hi rend="i">Vala.</hi> You test a theory by seeing if it
                        withstands assault; since Bentley hadn’t tried, I did. But the
                        reactions of Kilgore (and Wagenknecht, whom he quotes) tell me that I
                        overdramatized the criticism. Bentley had enlivened his bibliographical
                        prose by declaring that Erdman had "gambled heavily . . . and lost a
                        sizeable proportion of his shirt" (p. 168). Bentley was right, except
                        perhaps in his proportions, but some of his dating evidence was left without
                        a stitch. His theory of "anomalous" leaves, rather arbitrarily
                        defined, put seven late pages into VIIa and only six early ones; it seemed a
                        hypothesis that just got in the way. I was testing the structure of his
                        argument, not building one of my own. Lincoln, now, makes a carefully
                        elaborated extension of Bentley’s valuable suggestion that VIIb was
                        matter displaced from VIII.</p>
          <p>Lincoln’s tracing out the probabilities of a coherent evolution which
                        involves VII in relation to the whole, especially the additions and changes
                        in IV, VIII, and IX, I find generally plausible, often convincing, and
                        elegantly handled. His sigla (VIIa, *IX, etc.) are clear and keep us aware
                        of moving in a world of hypotheses. But I am uneasy about some of his
                        arguments that appear to assume the possibility, where it seems slight, of
                        distinguishing plot requirements from changing intentions. We are all guilty
                        at times of confusing time of conception or composition with time of
                        inscription; he appears to be doing so when he finds a "reassessment of
                        the role of Los" in "late" passages (or takes it as evidence
                        of lateness: just which, is not always clear). The "tension rather than
                        cooperation between Los and Enitharmon" which Lincoln sees as
                        characteristic of Los before a reassessment interpreted as a product of
                        Blake’s changes of thought in 1803-04 is not unlike the tension
                        between Los and Enitharmon that occurs in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> as the
                        poet’s song "draws to its period" (see <hi rend="i">J</hi>
                        83-88). No one has suggested—but perhaps someone should—that
                        Blake underwent a reassessment of Los while composing the final plates of
                            <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi></p>
          <p>Lincoln replies that he is concerned strictly with changing plot requirements
                        and that his argument is that the text of 7b2 was excluded from the poem
                        until Blake had made a number of other important revisions—a matter
                        which requires trying to draw a distinction between time of composition and
                        time of inscription. "I don’t argue," he writes, "that
                        7a2 must be an addition because it describes the conversion of Los, but that
                        as this <pb id="p12-138" n="138"/> material appears to be an addition it
                        seems likely that Blake’s plot requirements changed; and that as the
                        Los passages in 8 seem to be a sequel to 7a2, they may be part of the
                        change."</p>
          <p>This is not a proper occasion to argue about the conversions of William
                        Blake, nor about the roles of Los or Orc or the shadowy Female who has found
                        him and will not let him go, in the <hi rend="i">America</hi> Preludium. The
                        revolutionary embrace (of 1776/1793) is surely not presented as an act of
                        jealous possession; yet possibly Andrew Lincoln is right to read the
                        Preludium as equivocal.</p>

                                ISSUE):</hi>
            </title>

          <p>The drawing at the bottom of the page is an example of a connection between
                        text and design that can be traced in spite of the unfinished state of the
                        poem. At the beginning of the second Night the male human body is shown in
                        its dependence on the element of water, while in the text Albion splits into
                        the dichotomy of "the human" and "the divine." Here
                        Luvah and Vala, after being cast into the furnaces of Urizen’s fire,
                        are caught in the veil of Nature (where life is fed by death), and begin a
                        state of generation under the compulsion of the "fortuitous concourse
                        of incoherent / discordant principles of Love &amp; Hate" (11. 12-13).
                        The body of man is therefore shown in its dependence on the womb of woman,
                        the body generated and brought to life with the seal of death and old age.
                        The body of woman is young, sensuous, fleshly, and alluring because her
                        destiny is to insure the eternal continuity of the cycle described by Luvah
                        in the text. The two figures are linked by the same tissues of blood, flesh,
                        unexpansive forms. Their eyes meet, fixed in the question the sexes will
                        eternally put to one another: "is it life or death you give
                        me?"</p>

          <p>This beautiful drawing—of Enitharmon’s body, displaying the
                        fleshly fragrance of her forms—seems to be the object that the figure
                        on the recto, with his hand on his forehead, is trying to scan. She is drawn
                        here in the very state of transformation that she is undergoing in the text:
                        from a shadow producing natural, vegetating forms without counterparts, to a
                        bodily vehicle helping Los "to fabricate forms sublime." Her
                        double nipples seem to offer the duplicity of milk containing both life and
                        death, which Los accepts, persuaded by the promise of the Spectre of Urthona
                        (page 85, 11. 42-46). Her genital zone is no longer hidden in secrecy;
                        beside her right thigh a crouching little figure is nursing a baby in
                        swaddling clothes; and signs of vegetation are drawn on the same line of her
                        left knee. The roughly sketched lines all around the lower part of the
                        drawing are hardly identifiable: the only impression they convey is
                        "circularity." This is what Los, Enitharmon, and the Spectre of
                        Urthona are trying to exorcize, opening the center of mortal time to the
                        translucence of vision. Considering the function of this figure in Night
                        VIII and her return to the realm of Urthona in Night IX—when the
                        Jerusalem hidden in her heart will emerge through the revived, ever-living
                        figures of Ahania, Enion, and Vala—it seems appropriate that here her
                        head is surrounded by a bandage, that she is kneeling, and that her attitude
                        and gestures express acceptance rather than joy.</p>

          <p>It is now over fifty years since Samuel Palmer’s son organized the
                        exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum from which the general interest
                        in Palmer dates. The artist was presented then as a "Disciple of
                        William Blake," and that loose description has stuck. Geoffrey
                        Grigson’s important account, <hi rend="i">Samuel Palmer the Visionary
                            Years</hi> of 1947, was constructed on the foundation of that
                        description, and even David Cecil’s brief but comprehensive
                        biographical sketch in <hi rend="i">Visionary and Dreamer</hi> of 1969 lays
                        the same firm emphasis. There has been much praise of Palmer—or at
                        least of certain aspects of his work—but no great willingness to
                        accord him any role other than that of "disciple."</p>
          <p>Palmer himself unintentionally encouraged this approach. The very word
                        "disciple" with its New Testament overtones perfectly evokes the
                        passionate religious wellspring of his art. He spoke of Blake with fervor as
                        one of the great spirits of history, morally as well as artistically
                        excellent, in a class apart. The intensity of response that Blake
                        characteristically showed is apparent also in Palmer’s best work, and
                        Palmer indicated that he felt such a response to be in some way
                        "Blakean." Yet his art is in almost every way of a different kind
                        from that of Blake, and, in sum, is by no means the work of a
                        "follower," either in its content or in its technique. We have
                        long been in possession of the circumstantial evidence necessary to form a
                        judgment of its real character, for not only have we had access to much of
                        his output, but A. H. Palmer’s illuminating <hi rend="i">Life and
                            Letters</hi> has been in print since 1892. Now that Raymond Lister has
                        edited the complete correspondence, still more of the essential material is
                        easily available.</p>
          <p>For Palmer wrote a great deal about both the theory and technique of his art.
                        He was a remarkably gifted prose writer, with a natural sense of rhythm, of
                        rhetoric, of imagery, and a voluminous store of quotations. There were
                        moments in his life when he contemplated turning to literature for his
                        livelihood, and he would have been well fitted for such work. "It is
                        very much easier to give vent to the romantic by speech than by
                        [painting]," he said. Accordingly, we have a vivid picture of those
                        aspects of the world and those ideas that moved him, or repelled him, and
                        can trace accurately in his letters the genesis of particular images in his
                        pictures from particular experiences in his travels. There is also a great
                        deal of information about his methods of working, especially after he became
                        associated with Philip Gilbert Hamerton, editor of the art magazine <hi rend="i">Portfolio</hi>, who got Palmer to write for him on the use of
                        watercolor and on etching. There are letters to pupils that give detailed
                        directions as to how to create special effects in watercolors, and long
                        letters to his patron Leonard Rowe Valpy expounding his personal
                        interpretation of natural phenomena as the substance of art.</p>
          <p>The mass of correspondence from Italy during his honeymoon, which Mr. Lister
                        prints with all Hannah Palmer’s contributions, charts not only
                        personal matters like the gradually opening rift between Palmer and his
                        interfering father-in-law, John Linnell, but the whole slow, marvellous
                        dawning of the Italian experience on Palmer’s sensibility—the
                        realization of "certain types of landscape only found in perfection in
                        Italy," as he said. It was for him "a course of
                        purgation—getting a quantity of rubbish and confusion out of my
                        mind." These reactions seem odd in the hermit of Shoreham, the
                        quintessentially English rural visionary. What need had Palmer of Italy, any
                        more than Blake? Yet Blake esteemed Michelangelo above all artists, and even
                        at the very beginning of the Shoreham period, Palmer was dreaming of Italy
                        and the great works of the Italian <pb id="p12-151" n="151"/><figure><head>A rare record of the Palmers’ honeymoon in Italy has
                                recently come to light, and as it is, as far as I know, the only
                                representation of Samuel and Hannah together at that time, it seems
                                worth publishing here.</head><figDesc>It is a drawing in pen and brown ink, on a cut fragment of
                                envelope, 4 by 7 ½ inches, and was acquired by the British
                                Museum in 1975 among a group of pencil drawings which, though
                                unattributed, are identifiable as the work of the Welsh artist Penry
                                Williams (1800-85) who lived in Italy for much of his life and
                                became acquainted with most English artists visiting Rome. The back
                                of the sheet seems once to have been inscribed with Williams’
                                name and address—in the Piazza Mignanelli, off the Piazza di
                                Spagna; only the final letters of the two lines are visible at the
                                edge of the sheet. A further inscription reads: " . . . of
                                Civitella has been made (for the poor,) amongst residents at Don O.
                                Mss a considerable sum has been realized, / July 1839". On the
                                recto, the drawing is bordered by a line, above which is written
                                "Civitella Gazette." Below, "price 2 Biagi. View of
                                the Serpentara .. July. 1. 1839. presented gratis." The drawing
                                itself is annotated with names of the various figures who are
                                depicted sitting and sketching on the rocks in an expansive
                                landscape: within the border, a "Boy" in a tree is
                                apparently the object of several of the sketchers’ attention;
                                and "M. Ainslie", "Mrs P." and "M.
                                Lear" are all easily identifiable. Samuel James Ainslie
                                (1806-74) is seated under an umbrella held by a manservant; he spent
                                much time in Italy, and travelled with George Dennis, author of <hi rend="i">The Cities and Cemetries of Etruria</hi>, published in
                                1848. "Mrs P" is evidently Hannah Palmer; she is shown as
                                a tiny figure, in a large bonnet, perched on the edge of a rock near
                                the ungainly form of her husband. ‘M. Lear’ is Edward
                                Lear (1812-88), whose lithographed <hi rend="i">Views in Rome and
                                    its Environs</hi> was to appear in 1841. Outside the border the
                                other members of the party are indicated; most of these are
                                unidentified, some of the names even illegible. They seem to be
                                "M. Schitter. M.Martin. M.Palmer Mr McNiven (?) Herr Fritz. Fr.
                                Frankson (?).M Duvivier (?)". "M.Martin" is Albin
                                Martin, a pupil and protégé of Linnell’s, who
                                had joined the Palmers in Rome in the Summer of 1838.<lb/><lb/>
                                Shortly after this expedition, Hannah wrote home from Civitella:
                                "Our life now is so thoroughly that of working people that not
                                knowing the days of the week we rose last Sunday morning in haste at
                                4 oclock in the morning, got all our sketching apparatus packed up
                                for going down into the valley to our daily work thinking it was
                                Saturday; not [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>; nor?] should we have been the
                                wiser had not Mr Lear, an artist here who keeps a journal, told us.
                                Mr Martin works as hard as anybody." Palmer, under the same
                                date, wrote: "Yesterday and today—for the first time in
                                our travels I have been wholly unable to work which is very
                                miserable as Civitella abounds so with beautiful foreground studies
                                that our time being short not a moment should be lost. Of Mr. Martin
                                I am sorry to be obliged to give a much worse account. In spite of
                                every precaution against sun etc. he has suffered every fortnight
                                since coming to Rome—with sickness at the stomach—so
                                as to be for several days unable to eat— . . . at Subiaco we
                                attributed it to the intense heat—but the air is much cooler
                                here and Mr. M. never sits late in the sun—nor without an
                                umbrella at any time." This may explain the large, wide-brimmed
                                hat that Martin wears in the drawing.<lb/><lb/> The sketch is a
                                delightful insight into the lives of Palmer and Hannah and their
                                friends during the Italian tour, and is strikingly similar not only
                                in its humor but in technique to the pen drawings of Lear himself.
                                It includes almost certainly the least sympathetic portrait of
                                Palmer to have come down to us; but a portrait at which, no doubt,
                                Palmer would have laughed heartily. (A.W.)</figDesc></figure><pb id="p12-152" n="152"/> masters. To George Richmond, about to tour the
                        continent, he wrote, "I should like to know how the Giants of the
                        Sistine Vault strike first upon your soul, in words as near as possible like
                        those you would break forth into on entering the chapel . . . I suppose,
                        with most young men that go to Rome, you will disagree with me when I
                        suggest that it is not most useful to spend time in copying one or two
                        pictures elaborately in colours: in a shorter stay how well might you serve
                        the arts in your country by making small drawings for engravings, of a few
                        of the very finest sculptures . . . I fancy myself working intensely hard
                        for a week on grey paper; the quickest way of copying statues; to give my
                        country a true version of the divine St. George of Donatello . . . ."
                        In imagination, Palmer was already (and he at Shoreham!) deep in the wonders
                        of the Italian Renaissance, planning not only what he would look at, but how
                        he would draw it. The progression from Shoreham to Rome was inevitable, and
                        in this at least Palmer is at one with his contemporaries, and very far from
                        Blake, who was self-sufficient in his opinions and responses, content with
                        prints and "dealers’ Titians" to use the barest clues in
                        constructing his own vast world-picture.</p>
          <p>And so Palmer moved on, impelled by a spirit of his age that exercised
                        remarkably tight control over him, considering that he was in almost every
                        respect a reactionary, one who cringed away from the present, who sought to
                        hide from the evils of "progress," who mistrusted science and was
                        terrified of the increase of agnosticism, tight lacing, urban sprawl,
                        pollution and public schools—a pattern of the conservative mentality
                        past and present. As he grew older, indeed, his very religion, the motive
                        force behind his greatest art, became prosy and prudish, the agent of
                        repression to his children and the subject of endless discourses that we
                        should now label typically "Victorian." Mr. Lister betrays an odd
                        lack of understanding of the educational methods of the period when he
                        castigates Palmer for feeding his three-year-old son on the Bible, Bunyan,
                        and <hi rend="i">Sandford and Merton.</hi> Palmer’s advocacy of a
                        bowdlerized Shakespeare is disconcerting, however, given his strong feeling
                        for literature, and his acquaintance with Blake’s own unselfconscious
                        modes of expression. Like many other talented artists of his time, he
                        succumbed to the stifling climate of general opinion (one almost senses that
                        he knew it, in his constant complaints about the unhealthy atmosphere of
                        London), and his art suffered like everything else. When in 1859 he wrote
                        "I seem doomed never to see again that first flush of summer splendour
                        which entranced me at Shoreham," he expressed the same nostalgia for
                        his own creative youth that Millais was to feel when, standing in front of
                        one of his early canvases during a retrospective show in 1886, he was moved
                        to tears by the contrast between that and his current work.</p>
          <p>The comparison with Millais, however, points up Palmer’s real
                        distinction from the successful Millais’ world of fashionable and
                        glib virtuosity. He never had any success as a "society" painter,
                        and although in a sense he never wished it, we catch an unmistakable note of
                        frustration and puzzlement when, in Rome, he watches his friend Richmond
                        moving in fashionable circles while he and Hannah are left out of the social
                        life of the city, and are given no commissions. When he returned to England,
                        fully equipped with the right subjects, he waited many years to be admitted
                        to the Society of Painters in Water-Colour, and there is no doubt that he
                        very much wanted to belong to that body of artists. It is in the context of
                        the Society, and of another, more informal institution, the "Etching
                        Club," that his later work can best be assessed.</p>
          <p>It was an avowed object of the instituted watercolor artists that they should
                        create works of high seriousness in their chosen medium, and indeed it was
                        to facilitate the exhibition of such works, without the unfair competition
                        of oil-paintings, that they had founded their society in 1804. They treated
                        subjects that ranged from the kind of picturesque landscape that is most
                        associated with watercolor to the grandest figure pieces, historical or
                        mythological, and elaborately detailed scenes in exotic countries,
                        especially Italy and Spain. Palmer worked in oil for much of his life, but
                        in practice showed a decided preference for watercolor, especially in the
                        second half of his career. He employed the methods of enriching and
                        strengthening watercolor used by many of his colleagues: bodycolor made its
                        appearance early on at Shoreham, and much of his later work was "a kind
                        of Tempera" as he said in a letter of 1873—which recalls,
                        perhaps, Blake’s use of that vehicle. Whatever the details of his
                        method, he strove to load his watercolors with a density of feeling and a
                        richness of detail that was precisely analogous to the intentions of the
                        Society. What we recognise as distinctive is the continuing strain of the
                        visionary insight into rural life that was so active in the 1820s; if
                        feebler and more rarefied, that fervid instinct for the inwardness of the
                        countryside and the religious force of its beauty informs much of his late
                        work, and makes him, in fact, one of the finest of the Society’s
                        artists.</p>
          <p>The technical range and power of watercolor at this period undoubtedly owed
                        much to the example of Turner, who was an inspiration to the founders of the
                        Society, even though by virtue of his membership of the Royal Academy he
                        could not belong to it. What emerges very clearly from the letters of Palmer
                        is that, while Blake was never superseded as his spiritual guide, Turner
                        became a technical and practical inspiration of the greatest importance. The
                        effect on him of Turner’s <hi rend="i">Orange Merchant</hi> of 1819
                        is often noted; but that large marine painting can hardly have had much
                        practical bearing on Palmer’s work. Even the atmospheric little
                        watercolor studies that date from about that time are hardly
                        "Turnerian" in any serious sense. But the meticulous precision
                        with which he constructed his later watercolors can have been based on no
                        other master. References to Turner’s watercolors are frequent in
                        Palmer’s writings; it is true that he asserts that Claude is the
                        greatest of all landscape painters—but then Turner would himself have
                        sympathized with that view; and Turner, he observed, "had the faculty
                        to which Claude never appeals in vain." While he was in Italy, he often
                        saw landscape through Turner’s eyes, and he indicates that Turner
                        conveyed the poetry of the scenery, just as he wished to do himself: "
                        . . . what beautiful country must <pb id="p12-153" n="153"/> be here in
                        summer it is difficult to conceive—the lights of Canaletti are like
                        the literal versions, and Turners more like the poetical . . . ." He
                        notes that Turner was very fond of the Val d’Aosta, and that he did
                        not like Subiaco; he inquires eagerly after "the fine collection of
                        Turner’s drawing at Mr.Windus’s"; he often asks about the
                        pictures Turner was showing at the Academy, and once comments on the
                        "corruscation of tints and blooms in the middle distance of his Apollo
                        and Daphne"—which "is nearly, tho’ not quite so much
                        a mystery as ever," and adds "I am inclined to think that it is
                        like what Paganini’s violin playing is said to have been; something
                        to which no one ever did or will do the like." In the same place he
                        says "I would give anything to see some of Turner’s best
                        water-colour drawings now; and if I am preserved to come home, shall beg the
                        favour of Mr Daniel to get me a sight of a most splendid collection . . .
                        ." He observed that "the plenitude of light [in Italy] gives a
                        coolness of shadow and a glow of reflection of which we have no notion in
                        England. No one has done it but Turner and he makes the shadows and
                        reflected lights much lighter than in nature." He carried this
                        enthusiasm home with him, and waited many years in anticipation before he
                        had access to the artist’s bequest, which was at first exhibited in
                        the South Kensington Museum at Brompton: "As soon as the Turners
                        come," he wrote in 1859, "I shall be out enough you may be sure,
                        in the direction of Brompton." Turner crops up in Palmer’s
                        letters as a figure whose every action and thought he has studied with love:
                        he adjures his correspondents to look at Turner’s prints for
                        particular subjects; to visit the Fawkes collection of Turner’s
                        drawings at Farnley Hall; he notes that Turner knew Margate well, and that a
                        house near Turner’s was haunted. In short, there are ubiquitous
                        indications that Palmer knew much about the life and work of Turner and had
                        "adopted" him as a touchstone of excellence in the field of
                        contemporary landscape.</p>
          <p>This may seem self-evident, given Turner’s preeminence. But the
                        significance of such a respectful regard in Palmer is far greater than that
                        of the mere professional esteem of the mediocrities in the Water-Colour
                        Society. In Palmer’s later work, we sense the striving to achieve
                        what Turner achieved of enhanced and rapturous union with nature; Turner was
                        not at all like Blake, but in his way he was a visionary artist, and as a
                        practical example for Palmer was far more immediately relevant. Mrs.
                        Hamerton recalled Palmer’s conversation as being spiced with
                        "anecdotes of Turner and Blake," and this coupling has never, I
                        think, been given its proper weight. Of all the ambitious watercolorists who
                        were influenced by Turner, Palmer was perhaps the only one with the
                        intensity and honesty of vision to benefit from more than his technical
                        lessons. Hence, he is a landscape artist of real distinction in a generation
                        of somewhat shallow virtuosos. Judged by the standards of his youthful
                        achievement—his own standards—he did not maintain his early
                        quality; but judged by <hi rend="i">theirs</hi>, he was a conspicuously fine
                        exponent of the grand watercolor style of the period.</p>
          <p>In his biography, Mr. Lister does not explore Palmer’s achievement in
                        any depth, contenting himself with a reiteration of the conventional summary
                        of his art, and reaffirming what he himself made clear in his book on the
                        etchings (1969), that it was as a printmaker that Palmer, late in life,
                        found himself once more. He concentrates on the personal aspects of
                        Palmer’s life, giving a full account of the long-drawn-out quarrel
                        with Linnell, though he follows A. H. Palmer’s conclusions in
                        apportioning the blame pretty evenly on both sides, while the letters
                        strongly suggest that Palmer was consistently well-intentioned and gentle in
                        his responses to a very difficult man (and the tone of Albin Martin’s
                        correspondence with Linnell—printed here when subjoined to
                        Palmer’s own—is quite as obsequious; which suggests that
                        Palmer was not unusual in being somewhat cowed by his father-in-law). He
                        recounts the appalling tragedy of the deaths of Palmer’s two eldest
                        children; but it is not difficult to present them in their full horror,
                        since Palmer himself put his anguish only too painfully into words. Oddly
                        enough, Mr. Lister offers no explanation for the death of Mary,
                        Palmer’s daughter, in 1847, although in the <hi rend="i">Letters</hi>
                        he quotes a statement by Hannah Palmer that the little girl had been
                        poisoned by a weed she had picked and eaten. All in all, considering the
                        range of documentary material to which he has access, he does not present a
                        picture that differs essentially from the existing one; and he fails to
                        narrate the story in a coherent or interesting way, flinging scraps together
                        as best he can, without giving them an overall and purposeful form. The main
                        facts are, for the most part, there; but Grigson and Cecil make better
                        reading.</p>
          <p>The editing of the letters is handled with much greater success. Mr. Lister
                        has assiduously transcribed, ordered and annotated a mass of confused
                        material, and makes very good sense of it. He has identified a large
                        proportion of the people mentioned, and pinpointed most of the multitudinous
                        quotations. His footnotes are helpful and plentiful. I would suggest that he
                        has erred in identifying the "West" to whose "recollections
                        from the old Masters" Hannah Palmer refers on 8 April 1839, and who
                        also appears in a note of 17 February 1829 as Benjamin West, P. R. A: this
                        is surely Joseph West, the watercolor copyist who made transcriptions of
                        pictures in the Louvre and other collections in a style influenced by
                        Bonington. I think, too, that it is mistaken to identify the phrase
                        "The thing that is not" as a quotation from <hi rend="i">Julius
                            Caesar</hi>, Act v, scene iii: it is surely the Houynhmhm paraphrase for
                        a lie, in the fourth book of <hi rend="i">Gulliver’s Travels</hi>,
                        which we know Palmer had read. The letters are very agreeably presented by
                        the Clarendon Press, and Mr. Lister’s system of transcription is on
                        the whole lucid. He eschews the editorial <hi rend="i">sic</hi>, but the
                        printers have not befriended him here, for there are many misprints which
                        can only mislead users of the volumes, who will have no guide as to which
                        are Palmer’s oddities and which the printers’ errors. The
                        editor himself seems guilty of a number of puzzling lapses, as when he
                        transcribes a phrase in a letter of 1839: "inveighed Hannah into the
                        conspiracy" is nonsense as read—the word must be
                        "inveigled"; the misreading is repeated several times. Again, Mr.
                        Lister occasionally interprets lacunae rather oddly: once Palmer ends a
                        letter, after a reference to Heaven, ‘which that we may ( ) day see
                        together in good earnest is the hearty prayer of . . . Yours affectionately,
                            <pb id="p12-154" n="154"/> S. Palmer": Mr. Lister inserts (to) in
                        the gap; clearly (one) is the correct reading. I am not sure that I concur
                        with his expansion of ampersand and contractions such as "affy"
                        for "affectionately," since he does not always expand
                        "ye" for "the" or "wd" for "would."
                        How very different Blake texts would look if "&amp;" were
                        invariably treated to editorial expansion! But these are minor
                        inconsistencies in a remarkable feat of careful research and consistent
                        editing which, whatever the merits of the biography, itself makes a book
                        extraordinarily well worth reading for its account of the mind of a
                        pathetic, lonely and pessimistic, yet distinguished man. It is a fit summary

                        least half divine, that he should sign himself, at the conclusion of one of

          <p>This paperback volume represents more of a tribute to Blake’s
                        marketability than to his artistry. Its modest price will ensure its
                        popularity in museum shops from Los Angeles to London, where, regrettably,
                        it will attract buyers who are interested in Blake but relatively uninformed
                        about him. For their five-dollar investment they will receive a fairly
                        competent eleven-page introduction to the poet-artist and to the Job
                        illustrations, a thirty-five page reprint of the Book of Job in the
                        Authorized Version, and twenty-two plates of decidedly inferior quality.</p>
          <p>The title page of this book suggests that it has been designed as one of a
                        series of "Masterpieces of the Illustrated Book," and Michael
                        Marqusee’s introductory essay is directed at the appreciative
                        amateur. Its three-part division discusses "Blake and the Bible,"
                        "Blake as a Visual Artist," and "Blake’s Illustrations
                        of the Book of Job" in, respectively, three, two-and-a-half, and six
                        double-columned pages. The brevity of these sections prevents any
                        exploration of those complexities and contradictions that make the
                        interpretation of Blake’s works so difficult and yet so rewarding;
                        what remains is an over-generalized, simplified rehash of prior scholarship
                        (although no debts are acknowledged in this undocumented introduction),
                        studded with illustrative quotations from the poetry and prose. Although
                        there is nothing here that one can condemn as blatantly wrong-headed, there
                        is equally little that is fresh or exciting to praise. The best that can be
                        said is that no one coming to Blake through this introduction will be
                        seriously misinformed. Had the publishers of this volume chosen to trim that
                        half of its length that is given over to needlessly reprinting the entire
                        Book of Job, replacing those pages with a more substantial introduction to
                        the plates, the prospective purchaser would have been better served. Space
                        might then have been found for a section listing Blake’s textual
                        variations from the King James Job, similar to the ones that appear in
                        Foster Damon’s <hi rend="i">Blake’s Job</hi> (Brown, 1966) and
                        in Appendix I of Andrew Wright’s <hi rend="i">Blake’s Job</hi>
                        (Oxford, 1972). Additionally, the reader would profit from the sort of
                        sensible analysis of the marginal texts provided by Jenijoy LaBelle in <hi rend="i">The Visionary Hand</hi> (ed. Robert N. Essick, Los Angeles,
                        1973).</p>
          <p>Passing from text to picture provides further grounds for even deeper
                        dissatisfaction. Reproductions are slightly larger (about five-eighths of an
                        inch) than the originals, though this discrepancy is not noted. Such
                        enlargement may have been deemed necessary to show detail: the printing is
                        very dark, and highly shadowed sections of many plates are muddy and
                        indistinct, despite the dead white paper that provides a brighter background
                        than the grayish or creamy tones of papers used at the time of the
                        publication of the originals. Night scenes like Plate XII ("I am Young
                        &amp; ye are very Old . . . ") are especially poor; in this plate the
                        outline of Elihu’s figure is indistinct at the left, and the
                        configuration of the mountain behind Job is not wholly visible. Comparing
                        these plates, page by page, with those in the clothbound edition of <hi rend="i">Blake’s Job</hi> published by Brown University, one
                        cannot fail to be dismayed at the very much poorer quality of the newer set.
                        Indeed, even the Dutton paperback version of Damon (with illustrations in
                        reduced size) provides clearer reproduction—and at half the cost of
                        the Paddington Press volume.</p>
          <p>Wearied as perhaps we are by the crescendo of lamentations that bewail the
                        encroachment of pop culture into the Temple of Art, we must regard this
                        volume as another bit of evidence that an increasing interest in
                        museum-going and concomitant rise in museum shop sales are combining to make
                        ventures like this one more and more commercially rewarding. We who love
                        Blake ordinarily rejoice when reproductions of his work are made more
                        available and inexpensive. If, however, as here, greater accessibility is
                        offset by a significant decrease in quality, what appears gain may well be
                        loss.</p>

            <p><hi rend="i">The Story of Job</hi> is a visual marvel, and creates some
                            interesting puzzles for a reviewer with loyalties both to broadcast
                            media and to Blake which I shall discuss in turn. Perhaps the most
                            impressive aspect of the production is the full and imaginative use it
                            makes of television as a medium for the creation as well as the
                            transmission of art. This is a virtue worth emphasizing (in particular
                            since the production was invested in by a <hi rend="i">commercial</hi>
                            television house rather than one—hypothetically at any
                            rate—freed to invent by public subsidy) for it represents a
                            standard of invention against which television production can be
                            measured.</p>
            <p>The television screen allows for the presentation of two, not three,
                            dimensions. A third dimension can only be suggested by proportion,
                            scale, camera angle, and spatial relationships: long landscape shots,
                            for example, "flatten out." Further, on television, colors are
                            themselves and do not blend easily, but transmit gravitating in the
                            direction of primaries and secondaries; though television can manage
                            luminescent pastels. This makes the medium ideally suited for
                            two-dimensional visual works such as the water colors of Blake.</p>
            <p>The ballet’s exploitation of these inherent characteristics of the
                            medium is brilliant and operates at all levels of the
                            production—in the treatment, choreography, performance, and
                            post-production mixing of the final videotape. Thus, for example, using
                            overlays of one video image upon another, coupled with effective
                            lighting and the use of lasers, the television ballet creates a visually
                            enriched heaven that is plausibly Blakean. At one moment a circle of
                            angels choreographed for Blakean motion revolves around the throne of
                            God transcending what a stage could allow and creating an environment
                            that is fully mental and unrestricted by the bounds of space and time.
                            At another moment, Satan is represented in fall or flight (the
                            simultaneity of these two points of view being enhanced by the medium)
                            against a backdrop of moving stars, so that he—as in Blakean
                            representation—is simultaneously static and moving, undoubtedly
                            in transition from one place to another, and yet between two places that
                            are wholly out of nature. Unhappily none of the photographic stills of
                            the performance provided by Thames Television to accompany this review
                            exemplifies this, most crucial and most effective, aspect of the
                            production. The intricate collaboration among the people responsible for
                            the initial treatment, the choreography, the performance, and its
                            realization on videotape is masterful.</p>
            <p>Similarly, the collaborators have achieved success with the use of color.
                            For technical reasons having to do with greater success in coping with
                            blue as a backdrop, primary use is made of the Butts set of water colors
                            (as reproduced in the 1935 Morgan facsimile).</p>
            <pb id="p12-156" n="156"/>
            <p>Coloration, costume, backdrop, choreography, and Blake design have been
                            carefully integrated to heighten the visual impact of the ballet, and
                            the luminosity of the television screen assists a striking transference
                            of Blake’s water colors into another medium. The angels and the
                            sons and daughters of Job, for example, wear filmy Blakean gowns of
                            yellow, green, blue, or red. Blake’s water colors are often
                            quoted by the gestures of the dancers and, by crossfading, the water
                            colors and the dancers sometimes coincide, the Blake water color fading
                            into the screen to conclude a scene of danced action.</p>
            <p>For budgetary reasons the scenes in heaven are visually enriched more
                            than the scenes on earth; and the production is thrown off balance by
                            relying more heavily on Blake’s water colors to move the action
                            on earth along than that in heaven.</p>
            <p>The ballet as a television production leaves only two things to complain
                            of:</p>
            <p>If one sees, as I do, Blake’s <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the
                                Book of Job</hi> capturing a mental scene in motion at key moments
                            in the action (as if caught by a candid photographer of the mental drama
                            rather than postures arrived at as poses for the recording angel), then
                            there are moments in the ballet which betray an annoying instinct for
                            reverencing rather than incorporating the key moments Blake hath left
                            us. Thus, for example, Satan and Job dance postures which tantalizingly
                            and dramatically suggest Blake’s well known "Satan Smiting
                            Job with Sore Boils" (and a Blakean thrills at the effectively
                            executed <figure><head>2 JOB (Robert North), JOB’S WIFE (Siobahn Davies, and
                                    the three COMFORTERS.</head></figure> counterpoint between the painting and the ballet) only to
                            conclude with the dancers freezing into a tableau and holding it for the
                            predictable fade to the water color itself. What Blake made
                            dynamic—a moment to be quoted by the dancers in
                            passing—has become self-consciously posed. There are other
                            moments in which the pictures are used more fluidly and effectively (Job
                            and his Accusers, for example); and the illustrations themselves do not
                            always appear when the ballet quotes them, but the overall effect is as
                            I have described it in this instance. There are, I think, reasons for
                            this rigidity which I shall suggest below.</p>
            <p>The second complaint about the production has to do with the generally
                            conservative and conventional nature of television production. In
                            television land, highly imaginative heavens inevitably suggest that
                            conflation of romance and technology known as science fiction. Thus
                            Blake’s enigmatic stony furniture in heaven, as designed for the
                            sets in this ballet, is made to resemble a generalized futuristic design
                            suggested, say, by the smooth slab that serves as a metaphoric motif in
                            Kubrick’s <hi rend="i">2001.</hi> Similarly, Satan’s
                            descent through the heavens, striking as it is in simultaneously
                            conveying stasis, motion, and transition, additionally carries the
                            unfortunate trappings of the movement of a spaceship through
                            intergalactic space as in conventional science fiction programming like
                                <hi rend="i">Star Trek.</hi></p>
            <p>The music for the production is the Vaughan Williams <hi rend="i">Job: A
                                Masque for Dancing.</hi> It is not, however, the fully orchestrated
                            version available <pb id="p12-157" n="157"/><figure><head>3 JOB (Robert North) with his WIFE (Siobahn Davies).</head></figure> commercially on the recording made by Sir Adrian Boult, but
                            the version rescored (by Vaughan Williams) for the touring ballet
                            company in the 1930’s and not given public performance since.
                            This is, of course, a reason in itself for experiencing the production,
                            for this previously unrecorded chamber orchestra version of the work is
                            sensitively done (conducted by Vernon Handley with members of the London
                            Philharmonic Orchestra). Unfortunately one hears it through the tinny
                            speakers reserved for television broadcast and so loses richness.
                            —When, Oh When will television broadcasters and manufacturers
                            conspire to learn that they operate in the same FM band that allows for
                            such magnificent recreation of sound on radio?—</p>
            <p>The dancing is entirely effective and captivating. This is a highly
                            skilled ensemble, fully capable of performing this difficult piece. Of
                            particular note is Namron, who performs the role of Satan—a
                            demanding role, done with flawless articulation and skill. There has
                            been some irritated response for having cast the only black dancer in
                            the production as Satan. The reply has to be, of course, that he
                            interprets the role magnificently and that no racial slur is implied.
                            Still, the production might easily have clarified the racial ambiguities
                            simply by integrating the casting of the sons and daughters and/or the
                            comforters of Job.</p>

            <p>The second portion of the review is more problematic than the first; and
                            its problematic nature is suggested by the lineage that results in this
                            production.</p>
            <p>In the beginning there was Job. Then there were Blake’s
                            illustrations of it, and then the scenario by Sir Geoffrey Keynes from
                            which Ralph Vaughan Williams composed a score, out of which Dame Ninette
                            de Valois created a ballet. The music is now used for a new treatment
                            and a new choreography. To whom should a reviewer owe his allegiance if
                            he does not want simply to bloom in a demonstration of the anxieties of
                            influence? For purposes of the second portion of this review, I will
                            place mine squarely with Blake on the grounds that no one involved in
                            the conception of <hi rend="i">The Story of Job</hi> thought they were
                            doing it without him. I do so with the insistence that it is possible to
                            make a satisfying artistic experience unintentionally abusing or even
                            deliberately misreading Blake.</p>
            <p>On its merits, this is a wonderful production. It is not Blake, though
                            its producers would like it to be so. The ballet contains a narration
                            (competently managed by Andrew Cruickshank) from the Authorized Version
                            of the Bible, amounting to a plot synopsis, and implying that Blake is
                            merely illustrating the well-known text. This ignores Blake’s own
                            inscriptions on the engraved designs which quote the Bible from Genesis
                            to Revelation and additionally provide invented "captions" of
                            his own. Nor is this complaint easily dismissed as one made on behalf of
                            Blake specialists petulant for being dispensible; for it is the main
                            thrust of the designs that is bypassed in ways that some basic awareness
                            of Blake’s work might well have precluded. Blake’s
                            relationship to any text he illuminates is enigmatic and elliptical;
                            seldom does he simply illustrate; and nowhere is this more true than in
                            his intricate visual <hi rend="i">interpretation</hi> of The Book of
                            Job—as the commentary by Keynes and Binyon in the Morgan
                            facsimile might have indicated.</p>
            <p>The designs are variously mimed, quoted, and shown without much attention
                            to what they mean because they are taken as illustrations rather than
                            illuminations of Job; and this, I think, accounts for some of the
                            woodenness mentioned earlier in the review.</p>
            <pb id="p12-158" n="158"/>
            <p>The ballet dutifully (and promisingly) begins and ends with the first and
                            last of Blake’s illustrations—with the musical instruments
                            hanging up in the tree in the first illustration and being played in the
                            last. But the ballet has the performers dancing about with queer Blakean
                            instruments in the concluding scene without knowing what to do with them
                            other than to freeze in place for the final quotation, cross-mix, and
                            fade. For the point has been missed—that Job has undergone a last
                            judgment from a pious and dutiful reverence for his gifts to an
                            energetic and creative use of them. The end of the ballet seems piously
                            grateful for the hard time just got over; and we are <hi rend="i">still</hi> in need of the Blakean vision we ought just to have had
                            to correct it. This is an error of interpretation that interferes with
                            the entire ballet. The initial relationship between Job and his wife and
                            between Job and his children is danced as far too affectionate and
                            caring for the story Blake is telling. This provides an opportunity for
                            some beautifully rendered ensemble and duet dancing, particularly by Job
                            (Robert North) and his wife (Siobahn Davies), but it is not Blake.</p>
            <p>In Blake’s designs, Job and his God are reflections of each other,
                            and this feature is somewhat enhanced by having both characters
                            interpreted by the same dancer, Robert North. North sustains both roles
                            with eloquence and skill; but the roles, makeup, hair style, and manner
                            have been made different and so the point is lost. As Job, he is fluid,
                            emotionally vigorous and appealing, and too young; while as God he is
                            staccato, deliberate, and a bit harried, but not convincingly
                            authoritative.</p>
            <p>But perhaps most annoying, and attributable to the same failure of
                            interpretation outlined above: <figure><head>4 JOB (Robert North) rejoicing with his daughters after his
                                    new understanding of GOD.</head></figure> the sequence of the designs is altered. It is out of the
                            fourteenth illustration (When the Morning Stars Sang Together)
                            beautifully rendered that Satan’s descent emerges, thus losing
                            the point of struggling to arrive at that epiphany. Further,
                            Job’s Evil Dream (illustration 11) is moved considerably forward
                            such that the sequence of Job’s torments emerge out of his dream,
                            rather than Blake’s way, that among Job’s
                            torments—and perhaps the most decisive of them—is his
                            apocalyptic dream. Thus the ballet conveys the uneasy implication that
                            all that occurs to Job is "only" a dream, albeit a moving and
                            prophetic one. It must be added, however, that within the context of the
                            dream, the sequence of devastations is eloquently rendered, as is the
                            interaction between Job and his Comforters, including Elihu (Ross
                            McKim)—these last being rendered in a Blakean way.</p>
            <p>There is no reason why the production of a ballet cannot rework
                            Blake’s visual materials to its own ends. But for what purpose?
                            to what end? In this instance I infer that the producers had not
                            intended to do so; and that a production which moved me and which I
                            liked might have been more moving yet had it adhered to what it tried to
                            convey in a centrifugal rather than centripetal manner. In the form we
                            have it, the production loses an imaginative center and focus.</p>
            <p>I close with a lament that while an English audience has had an
                            opportunity to view the production, no such prospect seems imminent for
                            American television audiences. The approximate cost for securing rights
                            to American broadcast is estimated at $16,000—not much as these
                            things go—but initial reactions from American public television
                            are discouraging.</p>

          <p>A new gallery specially designed for the Tate Gallery’s Blake
                        collection is scheduled to open in Autumn 1978. As well as the majority of
                        the Tate’s own Blake collection and a section devoted to such artists
                        as Samuel Palmer and George Richmond, the display will include the two
                        panels "Winter" and "Evening" lent by the Vaughan
                        Johnson Trust, the watercolor sketch "Job and His Daughters" lent
                        by Dr. R. E. Hemphill and a group of works from the Bateson Collection. The
                        Bateson Collection, which was previously on long loan to the Honolulu
                        Academy of Arts, includes the four works shown in the large Tate Gallery
                        exhibition earlier in the year, "Pestilence," the color print
                        "Satan exulting over Eve," the sketch for the alternative design
                        for the title page to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, and the late book
                        illustration discussed elsewhere in this issue of <hi rend="i">Blake.</hi>
                        In addition the collection contains three other works which have also been
                        placed on long loan at the Tate Gallery, a tracing possibly by Blake himself
                        from the drawing of "The Last Judgment" in the Rosenwald
                        Collection, the drawing of "Adam and Eve sleeping" included by
                        Geoffrey Keynes in his first book of <hi rend="i">Pencil Drawings by William
                            Blake</hi>, 1927, as no. 35 but later recognized by him as a drawing by
                        Edward Francis Burney, and a pen and wash drawing of "The Expulsion of
                        Adam and Eve" which bears a false signature of Blake and the date
                        "1803" but is certainly not by him. Not all of these works will be
                        on view but those in store can be seen by appointment. MARTIN BUTLIN, KEEPER

          <p>The Special Session on "Blake’s Concept of Self" is
                        scheduled for the annual meeting of the Modern Language Association in New
                        York this December. Prof. Anne Mellor of Stanford University will be heading
                        the session. An abstract of each paper to be presented follows:</p>
          <p>Robert N. Essick, "William Blake: The Printmaker as Poet"</p>
          <p>The paper will consider some of the ways in which Blake’s profession
                        influences his poetry. Eighteenth-century etching and engraving involved
                        procedures, both mental and physical, that shaped the imagery of the
                        Illuminated Books. In <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Blake’s struggles as a printmaker became part of
                        the biographical material he transformed into universal myth. A study of
                        these influences and references offers insights into Blake’s habits
                        of mind as a poet and into his conception of himself as an artist.</p>
          <p>Christine Gallant, "Blake’s Presence as First-Person Voice in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>"</p>
          <p>Blake is concerned with the unification of the Self—a Self that
                        includes the unconscious, or Chaos—and he explores the unconscious
                        throughout his poetry. He strongly desires his reader to understand this
                        hidden part of the Self as well, as he leads the reader of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> through day-by-day experiences of "the Chaos of
                        Satan." We can see this in Blake’s use of the first-person
                        voice, an unusual tense for him (save in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>). Jung
                        helps to understand the use of this tense as he analyzes the authoritative
                        voice appearing in dreams, a voice seeming to come from outside the
                        dream’s context. He says that such a voice may be either a spokesman
                        of the unconscious for the dreamer or (very rarely) a messenger from
                        "the supraordinate Self." The first-person voice functions in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> as does this dream-voice. Blake’s use of
                        this tense reveals that in these passages he saw himself as such a
                        spokesman, both for the unconscious and for the unified center of the total
                        personality which is the Self.</p>
          <p>John H. Sutherland, "Some Blake Self-Images in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>
                        and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>"</p>
          <p>The term "self-images" is used to refer to pictures in which Blake
                        reveals fairly directly something of his own inward state. Five plates from
                            <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (<hi rend="i">M</hi> 10, 32, 37, 40, 47) and
                        three plates from <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 1, 6,
                        100) are discussed (plates numbered here as in <hi rend="i">The Illuminated
                            Blake</hi>). It is argued that some of these are pictures connected with
                        peak experiences in Blake’s life. A pattern of spiritual
                        auto-biography is suggested, and the question is raised as to whether this
                        pattern directly reflects Blake’s perception of his own life, or
                        whether the pattern is a partial fiction designed to enhance the structures
                        of his two works. Particular attention is given to <hi rend="i">J</hi> 100,
                        which is taken as an interesting vision, by Blake, of his own spiritual
                        state late in life.</p>

                        be "Blake on Language and Writing." Those interested in being on a
                        panel should send Mitchell a paper of not more than fifteen pages by 30
                        March 1979 at the latest, sooner if possible. (This Blake session should not
                        be confused with the one scheduled for MLA December 1978.)</p>
