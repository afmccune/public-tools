        <p>As everyone knows who has ever gone from a text of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                    edited by Keynes to one edited by Erdman, the second chapter of the work exists
                    in two arrangements of plates.<ref target="n0" type="note">*</ref><note id="n0">I wish
                        to express my gratitude to Morton D. Paley, David V. Erdman and G.E.
                        Bentley, Jr., for stimulating and enlightening exchanges on the subject
                        treated in this essay and for other generosities during its
                        preparation.</note> Certain inconveniences have attended this
                    fact—a clutter of bracketed numbers to designate the variant plates,
                    confusions in the classroom when students show up with the differing texts,
                    difficulties for readers of the Doubleday edition when they use the Concordance
                    and Damon’s <hi rend="i">Dictionary.</hi> More troubling, the existence
                    of these widely differing arrangements tends to feed the still common suspicion
                    that the order of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> is arbitrary, capricious, and
                    perhaps incoherent. Blake criticism, however, has generally shied away from this
                    textual problem, troubling or not. It remains, in the words of one important
                    critic, “a vexing question that deserves a complete analysis never
                    accorded it.”<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref><note id="n1"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Stuart Curran, “The Structures of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>,” in <hi rend="i">Blake’s Sublime
                            Allegory: Essays on</hi> The Four Zoas, Milton, <hi rend="i">and</hi>
                        Jerusalem, ed. Stuart Curran and Joseph Anthony Wittreich, Jr. (Madison:
                        Univ. of Wisconsin Press, 1973), p. 334.</note></p>
        <p>A complete analysis is perhaps not feasible; the external record is barren of
                    pertinent information, and we still know too little about the principles that
                    inform Blake’s architectonics to settle the matter conclusively by an
                    appeal to those principles. The best we can do is to interpret the available
                    data with hypotheses that are plausible, consistent, and widely applicable to
                    the art of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> Mindful of the speculative nature of the
                    enterprise, I will venture in this essay to provide such hypotheses along with
                    the evidence that supports them. If the following arguments are detailed, it is
                    because I believe that the question of Chapter II is important enough to warrant
                    close pursuit, not only for its intrinsic interest but also for the suggestive
                    light it sheds on the creative forces that shape <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> as
                    a whole.</p>
        <p>The questions raised by the reordering of plates in Chapter II are questions of
                    form and structure, not questions of thematic meaning. What kind of work is it,
                    we are forced to ask, that can suffer its internal sequences to become
                    transposed without any radical disturbance to the equilibrium of the whole?
                    Among the possible answers to this question are two that fit the particular
                    characteristics of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>: it is a work composed of
                    sub-units that are discrete and autonomous,<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref>
                    and it is a work where coherence of visual design often rules arrangements at
                    the expense of narrative and thematic continuity. In Chapter II these
                    characteristics are somewhat easier to observe than they are elsewhere in the
                    poem. In transposing pls. 29-41 with 43-46 (as numbered in the First Order<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> of copies A and C) when he assembled copies
                    D and E, Blake revealed the seams and faultlines of the chapter, the boundaries
                    of its tectonic components, units that remain undivided themselves in either
                    arrangement. Three extended sets of plates emerge to view, 29-41, 43-46, and
                    47-50 (I refer to them hereafter, respectively, as Sequences 1, 2, and 3). Once
                    we become aware of the seams between these internal units, we are quick to
                    notice other seams even where the “stitching” has remained intact.
                    The thirteen plates of Sequence 1 soon resolve themselves into two more or less
                    autonomous sets, 29-32 and 33-41, the latter containing the centerpiece of the
                    chapter, the parley of the cathedral cities gathered to save Albion. Each of
                    these separable units in the chapter maintains its own autonomous coherence both
                    in verbal content and in framing visual design. As poetry, these units take the
                    form of detachable dramatic setpieces, as in pls. 33-41, or more typically, of
                    radically condensed epics, self-sufficient synoptic visions of Blake’s
                    total myth;<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> the work as a whole comes to
                    look like a compilation of brief epic lays devoted to the same cycle of myths,
                    with the inevitable variations overlaps, and repetitions that such compilations
                        display.<ref target="n5" type="note">5</ref> At the same time the visual
                    designs that penetrate and frame these lays array themselves in demonstrably
                    coherent patterns, and each pattern is specific to the unit it frames, the key
                    signature, as it were, of that unit’s autonomy. It appears that the small
                    narrative units acquired their visual shapes and their etched state long before
                    they fell together into the order we find in the earliest extant copies of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi><note id="n2"><hi rend="s">2</hi> Karl Kroeber has cited Blake’s penchant
                        for repetition to account for <hi rend="i">Jerusalem’s</hi>
                        structure: “Reiteration permits a fluidity of structure; to a degree
                        plates can be rearranged because reordering does not upset patterns of
                        allusion” (“Delivering <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>” in
                            <hi rend="i">Blake’s Sublime Allegory</hi>, p. 352n). I would put
                        the matter the other way around: fluidity of structure permits repetition.
                        Because the units are discrete, not enchained in a consecutive argument,
                        they tend toward internal comprehensiveness, and comprehensiveness within
                        the part virtually guarantees repetition in the whole.</note><note id="n3"><hi rend="s">3</hi> The terms “First Order” and

                        brief glance at Sequence 2 (pls. 43-46 in the First Order) may suffice for
                        the time being as an illustration. The sequence starts with a memory of the
                        prelapsarian Eden (“I elected Albion for my glory,” the voice
                        of the Divine Vision begins [43.6]), but Albion turns into “darkning
                        rocks” (43.28) and there ensues a long account of the initial strife
                        of Albion and Luvah (43.33-82), quoted directly from <hi rend="i">The Four
                            Zoas</hi>, Night III, followed by the escape of Enitharmon and the
                        Spectre of Urthona from the wreckage of the fall (44.1-4) and their
                        assimilation in the bosom of Los (44.16-17)—here we see a quick
                        synopsis of much of the action in the five middle nights of <hi rend="i">The
                            Four Zoas.</hi> The sequence then quickly moves us into the present:
                        fortified by his spiritual reunion, Los (Blake) explores London in search of
                        the Minute Particulars (45.2-38) while European war rages (“the
                        strife of Albion &amp; Luvah is great in the east” [45.55-56]), and
                        Albion’s sons aggregate ominously into Druidic powers, bringing the
                        cycle back to where it started: “All things begin &amp; end, in
                        Albions Ancient Druid Rocky Shore” (46.15). Quotations of Blake are

                        whose influence is evident in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, thought that
                        Genesis itself might be regarded as a “collection of

                        few chapters with their overlapping considerations of the same events and

        <p>With so much potential autonomy granted to the work’s smaller units it is
                    a wonder that the larger divisions of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, its four
                    chapters, maintain as much stability as they do from copy to copy. Critics often
                    speak of “thematic juxtaposition” as the principle that binds
                    sequence to sequence within the poem,<ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref> and
                    that principle has fueled enough commentary to make further elaboration of it
                    superfluous here. Less well recognized and more in need of attention is the
                    massive role that patterns of visual design play in forging links between the
                    different sections of each chapter. To cite instances from Chapter II only,
                    sequences <pb id="p16-193" n="193"/> rich in large designs<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> are juxtaposed for the sake of balance with sequences
                    that are relatively poor (e.g., pls. 33-41 and 29-32, respectively);
                    iconographically related designs belonging to independent sequences gravitate to
                    one another and bind their respective sequences together (as in the ironic
                    juxtaposition of illuminations on pls. 46 and 47, portraits of Jerusalem and
                    Vala in composure and disarray<ref target="n8" type="note">8</ref>); visual
                    echoes and correspondences appear widely dispersed in the chapter (as in the
                    four half-page illuminations in the chapter, on pls. 28, 37, 41, and 50, the
                    first and the last posted at the extremes of the chapter, the middle pair
                    standing like sentinels on either side of its center—pl. 37 nine
                    positions removed from pl. 28, pl. 41 nine positions removed from pl. 50). Such
                    evidence recalls us to the necessity, splendidly demonstrated by W.J.T. Mitchell
                    in <hi rend="i">Blake’s Composite Art</hi>, of considering the Blakean
                    illumination “<hi rend="i">as a picture in a world of
                        pictures</hi>,”<ref target="n9" type="note">9</ref> a world that is
                    essentially independent of the world of text. No attempt to account for the
                    ordering or reordering of plates in a poem as richly illuminated as <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> can afford to proceed without that insight as a guide. <note id="n6"><hi rend="s">6</hi> See Harold Bloom, <hi rend="i">Blake’s
                            Apocalypse: A Study in Poetic Argument</hi> (Garden City, N.Y.:
                        Doubleday, 1963), p. 432.</note><note id="n7"><hi rend="s">7</hi> By “large” designs, I refer in
                        this essay to illuminations individually occupying a quarter of a plate or
                        more, set off from the text in black (copy E excepted), heavily inked
                        backgrounds, as opposed to small, unframed interlinear or marginal designs.
                        The latter, though often attractive and iconographically significant, do not
                        intrude on the text or strongly demarcate its boundaries as a visual block
                        and are thus left out of my arguments here. There are thirteen large
                        designs, as defined here, in Chapter II of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>: two
                        each on pls. 31, 33, 35, and single blocks on pls. 28, 37, 41, 44, 46, 47,
                        50. The interlinear design of the plowman on pl. 29 and the headpiece of the
                        blacksmith on 32 are too narrow by far to counteract the visual effect of
                        overwhelming textual presence. The somewhat larger headpieces on pls. 39 and
                        40 are borderline cases, but I do not consider them to have a significant
                        effect on the balance of distribution in Chapter II’s
                        illuminations.</note><note id="n8"><hi rend="s">8</hi> Leopold Damrosch, Jr., in <hi rend="i">Symbol

        <p>Nor may we content ourselves merely with tracing iconographic relationships. The
                    true autonomy of Blake’s designs inheres not in the likelihood that they
                    “mean” something that the text also means, but that they break the
                    text, provide it with spacing, that is, open spaces within it to an antitextual
                    universe. Indeed a study of his work from a purely visual standpoint must see
                    the text itself as a visual element, just as the walls between windows are part
                    of the visual facade of a building. Thus we must attend to the formal layout of
                    Blake’s plates <ref target="n10" type="note">10</ref> and consider the
                    location of the design on the plate, the proportions of text space and picture
                    space, and patterns in the distribution of these spaces within the plates taken
                    collectively. Independent of the sense of the texts they accompany, these purely
                    formal patterns often seem to follow laws of their own. As Blake reshapes his
                    work and new patterns arise in his mind, they are quite capable of encroaching
                    on the domain of verbal sense and interfering with its continuity. At the same
                    time local patterns of design become subject to effacement by new influxes of
                    verbal invention. To quote Mitchell again, the “relationship [of text and
                    design] is more like an energetic rivalry, a dialogue or dialectic between
                    vigorously independent modes of expression.”<ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref> Out of this rivalry (with design often getting the upper hand)
                    come the shape of Chapter II as initially found in the first printed copies and
                    the subsequent changes in order as well. To pursue this argument further,
                    however, and to enforce the general observations made so far, one needs to take
                    a closer look at particulars. <note id="n10"><hi rend="s">10</hi> A start in

          <p>One useful way of aproaching the changes that Blake introduced into the order
                        of Chapter II when he printed copies D and E is to view these changes as the
                        last visible manifestation of an evolutionary history lost to record except
                        in its very late stages. A certain amount of that history, at least in its
                        latter stages when Chapter II was beginning to coalesce, may be
                        reconstructed, however, from what is actually available to analysis in
                        copies A-C.</p>
          <p>The long thirteen-plate Sequence 1 is a good place to start. It contains the
                        center of the chapter’s dramatic action, the parley of the cathedral
                        cities. It also contains the most striking example of extended visual
                        patterning in the chapter. Plates 31-37 in particular display as a group a
                        conspicuously formal regularity in the distribution of their designs.
                        Throughout this series plates laden with illuminations alternate
                        consistently with plates fully covered by text (peripheral designs aside);
                        of the illuminated plates, three (31, 33, 35) display a common layout, a
                        miniature pattern of alternation, designs above and below divided by a
                        central band of text; the fourth (37) completes the series on a balanced
                        note, all text in the upper half, all illumination in the lower. Intricacies
                        of correspondence in the size of various blocks of text and illumination in
                        the series augment its visual formality.<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> There is no need to attempt a reading of the various
                        illuminations in the series 31 to 37 in order to discover patterns in their
                        arrangement; one has only to imagine these plates laid side by side to
                        observe a display of visual order that Blake must have devised deliberately
                        (see illus. 1). Once we notice the pattern, however, we soon realize that it
                        raises as many problems about the nature of its devising as it appears to
                        solve, that it conceals anomalies in the continuity of text and perhaps
                        effacements of earlier patterns. Though unified by its pattern of layout,
                        the series of plates from 31 to 37 proves not to be coextensive with any
                        continuous narrative unit but, rather, overlaps two adjacent units (29-32
                        and 33-41) that differ in subject matter and in script (an indication that
                        these units were designed independently). Linked to pls. 33 and 35 in its
                        visual design and style of lettering, pl. 31 is lodged in the middle of the
                        adventures of Reuben on pls. 30 and 32, even though the text of 31 has no
                        more self-evident connection with that story than the Reuben episode itself
                        has, graphically or thematically, with the series beginning on pl. 33.
                        Elsewhere in Sequence 1 other oddities appear: the continuous narrative that
                        begins at pl. 33 and includes the parley of the cathedral cities fails to
                        end where the visual pattern of formal alternation does, at pl. 37, but
                        flows on to pl. 41, passing through a distinctly different pattern of
                        layout. In the instance of pl. 31, a formal pattern extends itself at the
                        expense of continuity in subject matter; in the second instance, subject
                        matter spills beyond the confinements of formal pattern apparently designed
                        to contain it. <note id="n12"><hi rend="s">12</hi> The proportionate
                            measurements of the illuminations in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> is a
                            matter that has not been adequately studied. The proportions of text to
                            illuminations on some plates show clear deliberation, e.g., pl. 35,
                            which is vertically symmetrical, the upper and lower designs
                            2½” in height each, the middle block of text
                            3¾”. There are apparent relations in proportion between
                            different plates as well. Another 3¾” block of text
                            appears on pl. 37 and the single 5” illumination on that plate
                            equals the combined total of the two illuminations on pl. 35. The middle
                            block of text on pl. 35 (3¾”) is roughly twice the height
                            of the middle block on pl. 33 (1¾”). The headpiece design
                            on pl. 31 exactly fits the text space on 37, and the text and tailpiece
                            on 31 fit the space of 37’s large design. This sort of
                            correspondence is evident elsewhere in Chapter II: in Sequence 2, for
                            example, pls. 44 and 46 are like positive and negative images; where
                            text takes up the bulk of pl. 44, a design of nearly identical height
                            assumes its place on pl. 46, and where a design appears at the top of
                            44, on 46 we find a residue of text. Like any good designer, Blake
                            apparently strives for regularity without rigidity: pleasing variation
                            and harmonies sometimes unobtrusive, sometimes bold.</note></p>
          <p>To account for this apparent misalignment of subject matter and containing
                        formal design, we must attempt to recover what we can of earlier stages in
                        the evolution of the middle plates of the chapter towards their final form.
                        Only if we understand the principles that shaped and modified Blake’s
                        early material into the form we now possess can we begin to hypothesize the
                        reasons for such later revisions of <pb id="p16-194" n="194"/><figure><head>1. Layout, <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, pl. 31-37 (First
                                Order).</head><figDesc>Copy D, Harvard University Library.</figDesc></figure> Chapter II as the rearrangement of plates in copies D-E. Assuming
                        that <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> grew out of small, self-enclosed units,
                        brief bardic songs internally unified in subject matter and design, we might
                        try to reconstruct the early form of the unit that became the dramatic and
                        visual center of Chapter II, namely, the tale of the Divine Family,
                        particularized in England’s cathedral cities. It is likely that this
                        scene, which in its final form occupies nine plates, was once considerably
                        shorter and more unified in its tone and its visual design. There is
                        convincing evidence that Blake composed, designed, and etched the scene as a
                        unit of five plates, the first four still found together as pls. 33-36 in
                        copies A and C, and the fifth found as pl. 41. In all printed copies there
                        are anomalies in the transitions from pl. 36 to pl. 37 and from pl. 40 to
                        pl. 41, evidence which leads us to suspect alteration and patchwork. A
                        proofsheet of pl. 40 in the Morgan Library lacks the final line present on
                        that plate in all the finished copies of the poem. Since this added final
                        line is needed to make the extensive listing of cities tht follows at the
                        top of pl. 41 intelligible, it is clear, first of all, that when 40 and 41
                        were originally etched they were not intended to form a sequence, and,
                        second, that some other plate at one time did introduce 41 intelligibly.<ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref> Now on pl. 36, a catalogue of cities,
                        announced at the outset as “the Twenty-four in whom the Divine Family
                        Appeared” (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 36. 45-46), begins to unroll, but it
                        remains incomplete, indeed seems forgotten, on pl. 37. The lost complement
                        of the twenty-four turns out to be the cities listed on pl. 41. All
                        available evidence, then, including a probable catchword tie,
                        “Bath,” points to a perfect continuity between pls. 36 and 41,
                        a continuity that, as we shall see, is lacking in several respects between
                        36 and 37.<ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref><note id="n13"><hi rend="s">13</hi> Both Erdman and Bentley comment on the
                            variation between the Morgan proofsheet and pl. 40 as found in the
                            finished copies, with its added line. According to Erdman, “the
                            added line does show that [pl. 40] was made before the present
                            arrangement of plates, that it was first made for one position and later
                            made to fit another” (“Suppressed and Altered
                            Passages,” p. 25). Bentley, on the other hand, reasons that plate
                            41 must be later in origin than 40 and “presumably
                            contemporaneous” with the line added to the previous plate to
                            introduce 41 (<hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, p. 225). Bentley’s
                            reasoning does not explain, however, why Blake, if etching 41 as an
                            afterthought to the sequence, would place its introductory line at the
                            bottom of the previous plate when he could, with less trouble, etch it
                            with the rest of the new lines that were to make up pl. 41. Nor does it
                            explain why pl. 41 completes the unfinished catalogue of cities begun on
                            pl. 36 (see n. 14, below).</note><note id="n14"><hi rend="s">14</hi> On pl. 36 Blake names Selsey
                            (Chichester), Winchester, Gloucester, Exeter, Salisbury, Bristol, and
                            Bath. Seventeen more cities appear on 41.3, 5-7, 18-19. Erdman, in
                            “Suppressed and Altered Passages,” p. 25, argues that
                            “Bath” is not a catchword, but Blake himself appears to
                            have read it as such. On three different plates, 37, 40, and 41, which
                            other evidence suggests as having at various stages followed pl. 36
                            directly, he takes pains to insure that the first word is
                            “Bath.”</note></p>
          <p>The aesthetic integrity of the early five-plate version of the “Divine
                        Family” scene is manifest on several levels (see illus. 2). The tone
                        is sustained in its mildness. The narrative, typically synoptic, tells a
                        tale of Albion “turning from Universal Love” (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 34.7) and of Los summoning the twentyfour cities of the Divine
                        Family in emergency session, and it culminates in a catalogue of the cities
                        and a momentous point of crisis. The designs tell a tale of humanity
                        seemingly in the Spectre’s power though actually reposing in the arms
                        of divine love (pl. 33), of the apparent triumph of the Spectre as he rides
                        on high (pl. 35), and of the timely arrival of an apocalyptic chariot (pl.
                        41), immensely complex in its iconography, but certainly carrying the Bride
                        in the arms of a God that is “Not an Avenger” (see 41.28).<ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref> But the most striking pattern of these
                        plates is found in their visual layout. Here are five plates, five blocks of
                        text in strict alternation with five blocks of design, a study in doublings
                        and synoptic concentration: a doubling of doubly-illuminated plates, a
                        doubling of full-text plates, and a final plate that visually emphasizes the
                        duality of the two modes.<ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref><note id="n15"><hi rend="s">15</hi> A critical tradition is beginning to
                            form that considers this design parody, indeed as self-parody. Thus in
                                <hi rend="i">The Illuminated Blake</hi> (Garden City, N.Y.:
                            Doubleday, 1974), David Erdman is equivocal; he notes the presence of
                            apocalyptic emblems—the beasts are “ox-hooved, lion-maned,
                            man-headed” (p. 320), but at the same time “Blake knows
                            that the whole contraption would look ridiculous beside a fiery
                            Pegasus” (p. 321). Mitchell, in <hi rend="i">Blake’s
                                Composite Art</hi>, goes further: “The chariot is an
                            impossible rattletrap of old mythologies. . . . This monstrosity is a
                            self-parody, a satiric vision of Blake’s epic machinery”
                            (p. 216). See also John E. Grant, review of Damon, <hi rend="i">A Blake
                                Dictionary</hi> in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> (Winter 1980-81), p. 132.
                            Grant considers the design “pessimistic and parodistic.”
                            These views are invigorating and perhaps correct. But in reading
                            Blake’s designs we may be wise to prefer a cautious approach,
                            separating that which is indisputably there, such as the presence of a
                            combination of apocalyptic emblems, from what is critical inference,
                            based on notions of the grotesque that may not be Blake’s. The
                            iconography of the chariot is not without its precedents in sources
                            available to Blake, as Morton Paley points out in “

          <p>It is pleasant to speculate that this miniature illuminated epic, so
                        internally perfected, was the grain about which the rest of Chapter II
                            crystallized.<ref target="n17" type="note">17</ref> But if Blake once
                        intended the five-plate core to cohere as an aesthetic unit, clearly this
                        intent did not survive into the printed copies. Blake’s second
                        thoughts habitually impinge on and dislocate older stable forms (witness the
                        textual crisis that overtakes <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> between the
                        Sixth and Ninth Nights). Four plates, 37-40, in Copies A and C, now separate
                        the once adjacent 36 and 41. This situation is apparently the product of two
                        distinct interpolations, pl. 40, first, and then, possibly much later, pls.
                        37-39 (these latter plates go together as a unit; their script is uniform,
                        syntactic parallels connect pls. 37 and 38, and a catchword, as well as
                        continuous sense, ties 38 to 39). As far as one can reconstruct these
                        revisions, sometime after etching the core unit Blake decided to add pl. 40,
                        possibly to augment the role of Bath (perhaps under the sway of Richard
                        Warner’s <hi rend="i">War Inconsistent with Christianity</hi>).<ref target="n18" type="note">18</ref> Blake linked the new plate to pl. 36
                        via the catchword there but left it detached from 41. Possibly he considered
                        using 40 as a replacement for 41. To do so would avoid the non sequitur of

                            this series cohered as a unit from a relatively early period in the
                            coalescence of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>’s plates. On plate 34
                            of copy A, in the upper right corner, there is a residual trace of a
                            still earlier stage in the assembling of the poem, a small engraved
                            “6” that Blake has only partially managed to cover over.
                            Versions of pl. 34 that lack this “6” are likely to date
                            from an earlier stage still, and in the Rosenwald Collection of the
                            Library of Congress there is in fact a proofsheet of the plate, printed
                            in black, lacking the “6” (a second proofsheet of pl. 34
                            printed in green, also in the Rosenwald Collection, shows the
                            “6” clearly). Yet even this proofsheet with the missing
                            “6” shows the catchword “By” that links it
                            to pl. 35. These two plates probably cohered from a distinctly early
                            period then, nor can we doubt that pl. 33, which is needed to make the
                            start of 34 intelligible, also cohered to it at that time; context
                            guarantees the connection of 35 and 36. For discussion of the
                            “6” on pl. 34, see Erdman, “Suppressed and Altered
                            Passages,” p. 49; see also n. 20 below.</note><note id="n18"><hi rend="s">18</hi> See David V. Erdman, <hi rend="i">Blake:

                            pl. 40 is later than 41 is the adventitious nature of the numerical
                            categories on pl. 40, “The Seventeen,” “Bath the
                            Seventh,” “the other Ten.” Blake’s curious
                            reification of “7” and “17” comes simply
                            from a count of cities named on pl. 36 and a count of their complement
                            on pl. 41. The collectivity of “seventeen” is a
                            noncecreation, like “Bath the Seventh,” brought in to
                            disguise the interruption that pl. 40 makes in the continuity of 36 and
                            41. “The other Ten” is an even bolder improvisation. This
                            is a grab bag category composed of the first six cities mentioned on pl.
                            36 mixed with the four supreme cities “in whom the twenty-four
                            appear’d four-fold” (41.23). Blake is in short effacing
                            his original symbolic scheme and improvising another as part of
                            necessary patchwork. By the time we get to what I take to be the even
                            later interpolation of pls. 37-39, the “Seventeen” have
                            attained an institutional status, Blake causing Los to say,
                            “Bristol &amp; Bath, listen to my words, &amp; ye Seventeen:
                            give ear!” (38.55). “The other Ten” are quite
                            forgotten here. Blake’s references either to
                            “twenty-four” cities or to “twenty-eight”
                            may help to establish the relative dates of certain passages. In the
                            core sequence 33-36, 41, the collective number is always
                            “twenty-four,” as it is in Chapter I (19.20) and in its
                            place of probable origin, <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> 42.16 (“I
                            beheld the Twenty-four Cities of Albion”). But in the presumably
                            later pls. 37-39, the collectivity grows to “twenty-eight”
                            (37.23) and remains so in Sequence 2: “The Twenty-eight Cities of
                            Albion” (44.26).</note></p>
          <p>By bypassing pl. 41, Blake might also obtain a smoother link with 42. The
                        first line of 42 (“Thus Albion sat, studious of others in his pale
                        disease”) might appear to proceed from 40.36 (“[Albion]
                        frown’d on All his Friends, counting them enemies in his
                        sorrow”). At the same time, however, the sacrifice of pl. 41 would
                        mean the loss of Oxford’s speech there, and, more seriously, the
                        disappearance of the conclusive half-page design of the apocalyptic chariot.
                        Blake apparently decided finally to include both plates, engraving the
                        present final line of 40 to give the opening lines of 41 a new rationale.
                        There was still a cost, however: a disturbance in the symmetrical layout of
                        the five-plate core unit, now grown to six. Here then is an instance, one of
                        many, where Blake’s matter and verbal expression managed to override
                        the claims of his form.</p>
          <p>The insertion of pl. 40 into the core sequence has relatively few aesthetic
                        consequences other than its effect on the visual layout, for it is
                        relatively homogenous with its surroundings. By contrast, pls. 37-39
                        massively intrude on the continuity of the core unit as originally ordered,
                        drastically altering its visual form and noticeably modifying its tone.
                        Although Blake is careful to provide a narrative link to pl. 40 at the
                        bottom of pl. 39, the sequence 36-37 is markedly disjunctive. The script
                        changes abruptly on pl. 37 from the smaller, more graceful, more cursive
                        style of pls. 33-36 and 41; Bath, “benevolent” in the last
                        line of 36, becomes “the poisoner: the best and worst in Heaven and
                        Hell” in the second line of 37; and pls. 37-39 introduce a harsh,
                        congested mass of Blake’s late mythic paraphernalia—the
                        Spectre, the Four Zoas, an infusion of biblical names into English
                        settings—matter virtually absent from the more sweetly rendered
                        account of the Divine Family on adjacent plates and only loosely related to
                        it. Plates 37-39 differ more strongly in these respects from pl. 40 than 40
                        does from 33-36, 41. It is likely that pls. 37-39 allude to a rather
                        different set of historical circumstances from those which inform the
                        original account, circumstances by no means clear but probably reflected in
                        such things as the darker treatment of Bath and the curious account of an
                        attempt to bear Albion back to Eden “against his will” (39.3).
                        These plates may be very late indeed; if the evidence of early suppressed
                        numbers scratched on the copperplates provides any clue, Blake may have
                        already adopted a tentative order for Chapter II before he even etched
                            37-39.<ref target="n20" type="note">20</ref><note id="n20"><hi rend="s">20</hi> Some impressions and proofsheets of

                                A. In Chapter II, Erdman reports besides the “6” on
                                pl. 34 (see n. 17 above) a “1°” or
                                “18” or “12” on pl. 28, a
                                “31” (pl. 31), “36” (pl. 33),
                                “9” (pl. 40), and “19” (pl. 50)

                                Recently the Morgan Library has acquired an early proofsheet of pl.
                                28 (a reworked version of the well known first-state pull of that
                                plate already in the Morgan’s possession) which confirms the
                                engraved number there as “12.” I cannot read any
                                number on pl. 33 in the copies I have consulted but have been able
                                to corroborate the “6” in various copies, the
                                “9” in copy A, and the “19” in copies D,
                                E, and (faintly) the posthumously printed copy I. These numbers may
                                shed light on the early order of the chapter, for the latter three
                                appear in the same order and at roughly the same intervals as the
                                plates themselves do in the extant First Order (the engraved number
                                on pl. 31 is irrelevant to the early order, since it is likely that
                                this plate is a quite late interpolation in the sequence, and the
                                “36” on 33, if it exists, must belong to a different
                                bout of numbering from the one that produced “6” on
                                pl. 34, for it is highly improbable that 33 was ever physically
                                separated from 34). Indeed, if one numbers Chapter II, starting with
                                pl. 28 as the first and leaving out the probably late arrival pl.
                                31, one discovers that pl. 34 is indeed the sixth plate in the
                                sequence; plate 40 is indeed the ninth plate if pls. 37-39 are
                                omitted as a late interpolation, and if 40 is “9” it
                                is easy to see why pl. 50 would be “19.”
                            <p>The “12” which we now know that Blake inscribed on a
                                plate already designated as the start of Chapter II supports
                                Erdman’s suggestion that “at one time the chapters
                                were under ten pages in length” (“Suppressed and
                                Altered Passages,” p. 49)—or, more precisely, it
                                suggests that the first chapter once consisted of ten plates exactly
                                (“To the Jews” would be pl. 11). This
                                “12” does make the early “6” on 34 and
                                the “9” on 40 problematic, though not insolubly so. At
                                some early point Blake may have provisionally situated the six
                                plates of the extended core sequence, 33-36, 40, 41, in a ten-plate
                                Chapter I, following the extant pls. 1-4 (a workable combination;
                                pl. 41, moreover, has both the visual appearance and the rhetorical
                                effect of a <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> chapter end-plate); in this
                                case, pl. 34 would still be the sixth and pl. 40 the ninth in the
                                series. Alternatively, the numbers “6,”
                                “9,” and “19” may simply have provided
                                Blake with a private guide to the internal ordering of the plates
                                that make up Chapter II (before late interpolations) without regard
                                to their ultimate numerical place in the poem as a whole. Since this
                                alternative makes better sense of the “19” on 50, ten
                                plates after the “9” on 40, it seems to me more likely
                                that the early engraved numbers represent, for the most part, the
                                internal ordering of Chapter II and that at the time of the
                                numbering the plates had already assumed much the same arrangement
                                as we find in Copy A. By this reckoning the interpolation of pl.
                                37-39 would not be merely late but very late.</p></note></p>
          <p>So large an interpolation as that of pls. 37-39 now quite effectively
                        obliterated the early verbal-visual design once intended for the episode of
                        the cathedral cities, but it also provided room for new elements of visual
                        design to integrate themselves with patterns established in plates already
                        etched. Thus the large half-page illumination on pl. 37 of Albion seated in
                        despair occupies the same niche, with respect to preceding plates, that was
                        once filled by the marginally smaller design of the apocalyptic chariot, now
                        displaced; in size, the design on 37 is precisely equal to the sum of the
                        designs on pl. 35; its subject continues the theme of humanity in the
                        Spectre’s power that was displayed in the designs of 33 and 35 and is
                        explicitly enunciated in the <figure/><pb id="p16-196" n="196"/> mirror-script on 37. Next, by etching pl. 38 as a
                        monolithic block of text, Blake continues a pattern that has prevailed in
                        the even-numbered plates since pl. 30. Further, the designs at the top of 39
                        and 40 are identical in size and contrapuntally related in subject; both are
                        water-visions, one conveying redemptive possibilities, the other fallen
                            states.<ref target="n21" type="note">21</ref> Thus a new five-plate
                        pattern of layout, 37-41, is added to the old, and the whole episode grows
                        to nine plates. In this expanded sequence, plate 37 becomes a new pivotal
                        fifth; in the thematic sequence, it provides a nadir vision of despair,
                        equidistant from images of the savior at the beginning of the sequence (pl.
                        33) and the apocalyptic chariot at the end (pl. 41); as an element of visual
                        structure, it anchors 41, the ninth plate, as well as 33 and 35, (the first
                        and third). Thus new patterns supersede old without wholly effacing them,
                        like the overlapping rings of lunar impact craters. Blake’s mode of
                        introducing new matter in his work is often nearly as violent, yet at the
                        same time his instinct for form persists. <note id="n21"><hi rend="s">21</hi> See Erdman, <hi rend="i">The Illuminated Blake</hi>, pp.

          <p>How the rest of Chapter II fell into the arrangement extant in Copies A-C is
                        a matter for conjecture only. At some point Sequence 2 (43-46) locked into
                        place with Sequence 3 (47-50) through the nexus of the great designs of Vala
                        and Jerusalem on 46-47. How this series of eight, with its powerful visual
                        center, attached itself to the core sequence is not clear. The somewhat
                        rough connections between pl. 42 and its immediate neighbors suggest a more
                        complex history of joining than we can now recover (42 may be the residue of
                        a longer series of plates pared down at both ends). Meanwhile the five-plate
                        central core had at a relatively early stage incorporated pl. 40. Somewhat
                        later, probably, the augmented core acquired the three-plate sequence 29-30,
                        32, as a proem.<ref target="n22" type="note">22</ref> The chapter now had
                        the form of a double set of nines, anchored together at what became their
                        medial pivot, the appropriately encompassing design of the apocalyptic
                        chariot on 41, equidistant from the beginning and end of the chapter. The
                        latest developments presumably were the interpolation of pls. 37-39 and of
                        pl. 31. The case of pl. 31, long recognized as an intruder,<ref target="n23" type="note">23</ref> bears further comment. A self-contained doctrinal
                        passage, its text may never have formed part of any extended sequence in the
                        poem, and for the reader it continues to remain aloof from its surroundings.
                        For the viewer, however, pl. 31 coheres very well with what follows it: it
                        displays precisely the same visual layout as pls. 33 and 35 and certain
                        iconographic connections with these as well (particularly in the repetition
                        of flying or hovering figures). By placing 31 where he does, Blake extends
                        forward the pattern of alternating textual and illuminated spaces so that
                        every plate from 30 to 36 (and, with the eventual addition of 37-39, every
                        plate to 38) is made part of the pattern. Here then is evidence that it is
                        often not the sense of the text but the look of the page that determines the
                        location of some plates in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> In form, like
                        apparently gravitates to like, creating a pattern that cuts into narrative
                        continuity and extends itself across the boundaries of discrete narrative
                        units. <note id="n22"><hi rend="s">22</hi> Plates 29-30, 32 do not appear to
                            have been etched at the same stage as pls. 33 ff., for the style of
                            script on these three plates is uncharacteristically large and elaborate
                            compared with the <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> norm. This script appears
                            in <hi rend="i">J</hi> 56 and <hi rend="i">J</hi> 61, palpable
                            interpolations both, leading Bentley to describe them as
                            “apparently late” (<hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, p. 225).
                            A more telling argument for lateness is the close resemblance of this
                            script to that of <hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi> (1822). Although
                            Erdman describes the script on <hi rend="i">J</hi> 29-30 as “an
                            early format” (<hi rend="i">The Illuminated Blake</hi>, p. 309),
                            the evidence leans slightly toward a relatively late date for these
                            plates in the etching of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> But even a very
                            early date of etching is no obstacle to relatively late attachment to
                            the core sequence of the cathedral cities, with which pls. 29-30, 32
                            share little in subject matter.</note><note id="n23"><hi rend="s">23</hi> See Erdman, “Suppressed and

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>This hypothetical reconstruction of some stages in the prehistory of Chapter
                        II brings us finally to the order of the first printed copies. But
                        Blake’s concern for visual form, for a handsome distribution of
                        illuminations, could not have ceased once these printed copies came into
                        being. Certainly Blake’s previous treatment of successive copies of
                        longer works—his rearrangement of full-page illuminations in <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> and <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, for
                        example—suggests the opposite. Indeed, <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> is
                        actually conservative in the general stability of its order from copy to
                        copy. Yet Chapter II, already the product of much careful designing and many
                        disruptive second thoughts, gets substantially rearranged in copies D and E.
                        In these copies Blake moves pls. 43-46 to the front of the chapter, just
                        after the chapter opening on pl. 28, and he inserts plate 42 between what
                        were in the First Order <figure/><pb id="p16-197" n="197"/> pls. 37 and 38. Any explanation of these changes
                        should base its inferences on the same principles that seem to have
                        motivated Blake’s earlier planning in the chapter.</p>
          <p>A quest after possible thematic motives for the rearrangement of the chapter
                        seems to me the least promising way of explaining the problem. Commentators
                        on this point have generally pronounced both orders thematically satisfying,
                        and indeed they are. In one order (A-C-F), after the proem of plate 28, the
                        narrative begins with Albion repudiating the Divine Vision; in the other
                        (D-E), it begins with the Divine Vision proclaiming its early intimacy with
                        Albion. The narrative in the earlier order shows Los undertaking a solitary
                        quest to save Albion after the group effort of the cathedral cities fails;
                        in the later order the cathedral cities appear to convene (though not
                        immediately—the Reuben episode and other matter come first) after
                        Los’s individual failure. In terms of thematic significance, these
                        alternatives offer little to choose from, since they both yield the same
                        gloomy outcome, a stubbornly unredeemed Albion. But when we turn our
                        attention from theme to visual form, very different consequences attend the
                        two orders. The rearrangement of narrative sequences demands rearrangement
                        of illuminations as well and an altered set of relations between blocks of
                        illumination and blocks of text. Given Blake’s evident concern for
                        such matters, we may plausibly suppose that he found the distribution of
                        illuminations in copies A and C unsatisfying, even though the arrangement of
                        sequences formed a reasonable, even a desirable, narrative order. If this
                        motive did in fact figure significantly in the shifting of sequences, it
                        provides us with a magnified instance <figure><head>3. Layout, <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Chapter II (First
                                Order).</head><figDesc>Copy D, Harvard University Library (rearranged).</figDesc></figure><pb id="p16-198" n="198"/> of Blake’s tendency to allow concerns for
                        form to prevail over an earlier coherence of content.</p>
          <p>The concern for form in this instance may, however, signal only a desire to
                        rectify imbalances in layout that earlier intrusions of content may have
                        caused in the first place. In planning the layout of the smaller units of
                        the chapter, Blake seems to have pursued a kind of medial symmetry as his
                        goal, sequences with strong pivots at the center and balanced elements
                        flanking it on the imaginary left and right. The same goal appears evident
                        in the plan of Chapter II as a whole. If we visualize its order before the
                        interpolations of pls. 31 and 37-39, we find a series of nineteen plates
                        (omitting the address to the Jews) with large illuminations so distributed
                        that their center of gravity falls in the middle (an appropriate
                        distribution for a middle chapter: large illuminations in Chapter I cluster
                        towards the beginning of the chapter; in Chapter IV they cluster towards the
                            end<ref target="n24" type="note">24</ref>). The half-page illumination
                        of the apocalyptic chariot occupies the tenth position (pl. 41), the exact
                        center of the series, flanked at opposite ends by the half-page
                        illuminations on the first (pl. 28) and the nineteenth plates (pl. 50). The
                        other large illuminations are distributed on either side of the center at
                        roughly corresponding intervals from it, five before and four after (the
                        greater massiveness of the designs on the later plates balances out the
                        slightly greater frequency of designs on the earlier). A well-balanced
                        visual order would thus have prevailed at one time in the chapter as a whole
                        as well as in its individual illuminated units. <note id="n24"><hi rend="s">24</hi> Six of the nine large block-illuminations in Chapter I
                            occur in the first half of the chapter, indeed within the first eight
                            plates of actual verse; eight of Chapter IV’s thirteen large
                            illuminations appear, in crescendo fashion, on its last seven plates of
                            verse, less than a third of the whole chapter. Large illuminations are
                            infrequent in Chapter III. (The five full-page designs in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> are excluded from this count.) For a table showing
                            the distribution of large designs in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, see
                            Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, p. 231.</note></p>
          <p>When Blake expanded the parley of cathedral cities by three plates (none
                        massively illuminated except pl. 37) and <figure><head>4. Layout, <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Chapter II (Second
                                Order).</head><figDesc>Copy D, Harvard University Library.</figDesc></figure><pb id="p16-199" n="199"/> interpolated them between the eighth and ninth
                        plates (36 and 40) of an earlier nineteen-plate sequence, he inevitably
                        displaced the center of gravity in the distribution of illuminations forward
                        in the chapter. The interpolation of pl. 31 near the beginning of the
                        chapter only served to make the shift in balance more pronounced. Thus in
                        the order of copy A, the reader encounters eight large blocks of
                        illumination in the first half of Chapter II and only five in the second
                        (the median of the 24 plates is found between pls. 38 and 39).<ref target="n25" type="note">25</ref> In addition, the very conspicuous
                        pattern of alternation and repetition observed in pls. 31-37 makes the
                        distribution of illuminations in the rest of the chapter seem ungainly, even
                        random. A massive clot of design on pls. 46 and 47 relieves the relatively
                        heavy weight of printed text in the second half of the chapter, but these
                        designs are too powerful in themselves and too isolated from other powerful
                        clusters of design to create an effect of balance. <note id="n25"><hi rend="s">25</hi> For convenience of division I include pl. 27,
                            “To the Jews,” in this reckoning. Unadorned, it does not
                            affect the distribution of illuminations in any measurable way. The
                            eight large blocks of illumination in the first half of the chapter are
                            on pls. 28, 31(2), 33(2), 35(2) and 37. The five blocks in the second
                            half are on pls. 41, 44, 46, 47, and 50.</note></p>
          <figure/>
          <p>For all the presumed defects of Chapter II as a visual sequence, Blake
                        nevertheless produced two printed copies of the chapter in this order before
                        he began to have second thoughts. The second thoughts seem to have coincided
                        with his plans for a full-color version of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (copy
                        E), a version in which the claims of visual design would have
                            preeminence.<ref target="n26" type="note">26</ref> If any perceived
                        deficiencies in the sequential design were to be remedied, a project such as
                        the production of copy E would certainly have provided the appropriate
                        occasion, and Chapter II, which is particularly rich in large designs, would
                        be likely to have received special attention. An inspection of the new order
                        of plates in the D-E version of this chapter indeed assures us that the
                        imbalances present in the A-C order have been rectified. If we divide the
                        twenty-four plates that compose the enlarged chapter at its median, we find
                        seven large designs in the first half and six in the second, a considerably
                        more even distribution than the eight and five split of copy A. If we divide
                        the chapter in thirds, the effect of medial symmetry is even more pronounced
                        (see illus. 4). In the first eight plates there are three large designs, in
                        the next eight, seven, and in the final eight, three (a similar calculation
                        applied to copy A yields five, four, and four, even-sounding enough, until
                        we observe that the distribution sequence within the middle third is itself
                        considerably lopsided [see illus. 3]). The medial symmetry that may have
                        been present in an earlier hypothetical nineteen-plate chapter is now
                        restored. <note id="n26"><hi rend="s">26</hi> Copy D, uncolored and
                            sometimes poorly inked, of course also displays the Second Order. But
                            there is little reason to suppose that D is earlier than E. Both are
                            watermarked 1820, and the length of time that the production of E would
                            need for completion argues for an early start on its
                        planning.</note></p>
          <p>In the transformation of pls. 43-46 into pl. <hi rend="i">29-32</hi> there is
                        one other consequential gain in pictorial symmetry. With the migration of
                        the former plate 46 towards the beginning of the chapter, Vala and Jerusalem
                        no longer change at the turn of a page from elegant aloof emblems into
                        fleshy women, falling with and falling for a man as contorted as they. An
                        ironic narrative sequence loses the link between its two parts, but at the
                        same time, by undoing this heavy conjunction of massive designs, Blake
                        restores a balance. In D and E the two versions of this female pair, one
                        version depicting eternal states and one depicting fallen vegetative selves,
                        are as symmetrically disposed in their locations in the chapter as the
                        emblems of St. Paul’s and Westminster Abbey are on the first of the
                        panels themselves. Plate <hi rend="i">32</hi>, formerly 46, now concludes
                        the <hi rend="i">first</hi> movement in the chapter, an epyllion of four
                        plates (not including “To the Jews” and pl. 28); it is more
                        than ever the mirror image of pl. 47, which introduces a <hi rend="i">final</hi> movement of four plates. Both plates are nearly equidistant,
                        on opposite sides, from the midpoint in the chapter (if one leaves
                        “To the Jews” and 28 out of the reckoning, <hi rend="i">32</hi> and 47 are precisely equidistant). The mirroring effect is
                        particularly apparent in E, where Blake employs an identical color scheme
                        for the bodies, clouds, and background sky in both pictures.<ref target="n27" type="note">27</ref> The parallels and the radical contrast
                        of these pictures are enforced by the symmetrical relations of their
                        location. They are fit panels to flank the chapter’s visual center,
                        itself filled with symmetrical doublings and oppositions, visual displays of
                        hard choices, of succor and disease, <pb id="p16-200" n="200"/> of soaring
                        and sinking, where the “best and the worst, Heaven and Hell”
                        often inhabit identical pictorial frames. <note id="n27"><hi rend="s">27</hi> This repetition of the color scheme is more exact in the

              <hi rend="i">The Status of Plate 42</hi>
            </title>
          </head>
          <p>One curiosity in Blake’s rearrangement of Chapter II remains to be
                        discussed. Why is pl. 42 the forty-second plate of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> in both Orders, even though the plates adjacent to it
                        shift radically? This plate once directly followed the nine-plate sequence
                        on the cathedral cities that ended with the picture of the apocalyptic
                        chariot. In the Second Order it appears deep within the nine-plate sequence
                        between plates numbered 37 and 38 in A-C. Since pl. 37 moves four places
                        back with the transpositions of Sequences 1 and 2 and 42 moves four places
                        forward, the latter needs no renumbering. It is hard to imagine why this one
                        plate should remain fixed in its place like a rock in a stream while a total
                        of seventeen plates before and after shift around it. Fond as Blake is of
                        symbolic numbers, the number 42 does not seem to be among them. The plate
                        has no large block-design. Although it presents a powerful speech by Los and
                        some fairly typical rumblings from Albion, there is nothing in the content
                        that marks it as demanding singular treatment. Finally, most curious of all,
                        to remain pl. 42 in the Second Order it must interrupt the continuity
                        between pls. <hi rend="i">41</hi> and <hi rend="i">43</hi> without supplying
                        any new plausibility; indeed it interrupts a series of parallel clauses in
                        apposition: <q> They saw Albion endeavoring to destroy their Emanations (<hi rend="i">41</hi>:31)<lb/><lb/> They saw their wheels rising up
                            poisonous against Albion (<hi rend="i">43</hi>:1) </q> In the Second
                        Order, two non sequiturs in the sense appear where there were none
                        before.</p>
          <p>In its original location in the First Order, this plate had no inevitable
                        connection to the plates immediately adjacent to it. It cannot have been
                        conceived as part of the scene of the twenty-four cathedral cities that
                        preceded it, for on 42 the parley abruptly disappears, and Albion states
                        that Hand and Hyle “have seized the Twenty-four rebellious
                        ingratitudes” (42:48), though nothing of the sort occurs in the
                        previous nine plates.<ref target="n28" type="note">28</ref> Nor does it
                        connect obviously with the succeeding plate, since 42 concludes strongly on
                        a line of summary finality (“This is the Net &amp; Veil of Vala,
                        among the Souls of the Dead” [81]), and 43 presents a powerful fresh
                        scene with its first line (“Then the Divine Vision like a silent sun
                        appeared”). Even in the First Order, then, pl. 42 is inessential to
                        narrative continuity. The most that might be said for its earlier location
                        is that its text provides at least an adequate transition from the
                        collective effort of the cities to the individual effort of Los to redeem
                        Albion. What it does not provide, however, is a fit introduction to that
                        last, immensely powerful synopsis of Blake’s historical myth that
                        bursts upon us on pl. 47, as “Luvah [tears] forth from Albions Loins
                        . . . in rivers / of blood over Europe” (47:3-4). Yet this is
                        precisely what pl. 42 must introduce when Sequence 2 is moved to the
                        beginning of the Chapter in the Second Order. Far better is the juncture
                        that actually apears in D-E, “O God thou art Not an Avenger”
                        (41 [<hi rend="i">46</hi>]) implicitly judging “that Holy Fiend / The
                        Wicker Man of Scandinavia” on the next plate (47:5-6), just as the
                        design of the apocalyptic chariot on <hi rend="i">46</hi> implicitly judges
                        the disarray of Albion, Vala, and Jerusalem on 47’s adjacent design.
                            <note id="n28"><hi rend="s">28</hi> The plate must have been etched
                            relatively early, however. The “rebellious ingratitudes”
                            are twenty-four, not twenty-eight or eighteen and ten (see n. 19 above).
                            Plate 42 may owe its oddly disconnected character to the loss of a plate
                            or plates once adjacent to it.</note></p>
          <p>Once again Blake seems to cater to the claims of coherent sense. In that case
                        pl. 42 must be removed, but where? It cannot be pushed further back, since
                        47-50 form a single, sweeping, unbroken movement from the first line of 47
                        right up to the etched words “End of Chap. 2” on 50. Thus it
                        must move forward. Oddly, it comes to rest at a point where it severs a
                        scene in the middle and interrupts a passage of verse previously bound
                        together by syntactic parallels; no catering to sense here. But from a
                        pictorial standpoint, the resting place is not so odd. What appears to have
                        happened is that the large design of the seated Albion on the lower half of
                        37 [<hi rend="i">41</hi>] has arrested the forward drift of 42, or to put it
                        another way, the first lines of 42, “Thus Albion sat, studious of
                        others in his pale disease: / Brooding on evil,” gravitate toward
                        their precise illustration, tugging the whole plate with them. That the
                        dislodged plate finally locates itself in the forty-second position of the
                        reordered <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> turns out to be fortuitous. What is
                        important, rather, is that the power of a design appears, once again,
                        sufficiently compelling to Blake to determine the position of a plate.
                        Moreover, just as the claims of narrative continuity failed to deter the
                        interpolation of pl. 31 between 30 and 32 at an early stage of the
                        chapter’s arrangement, these claims once again fail to deter the
                        interpolation of 42 between the former 37 and 38. In the latter case, more
                        than purely visual elements enter into Blake’s choice, but even here,
                        the continuity or bond that prevails is one between word and picture, not
                        word and word. In the tug of war between the visual and the verbal that goes
                        on throughout the evolution of Chapter II, the visual element appears to
                        prevail.</p>

          <p>In the long run, however, no one component of Blake’s composite art
                        can claim a permanent victory. If Blake altered the arrangement of the
                        second chapter in copies D and E, arguably on grounds of felicity of design,
                        not long before his death he changed his mind again, and in the Pierpont
                        Morgan copy of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (F) he restored the First Order
                        of page numbers. His deliberations on the matter evidently occupied him to
                        the very last, for many of the pages in Chapter II of F show signs of erased
                        or altered numbers, inscribed after the printing (one of them on paper
                        watermarked 1826<ref target="n29" type="note">29</ref>) but now superseded
                        by the extant numbers. As far as we can decipher these erasures they invite
                        us to believe that they are the remains of a Second Order foliation like
                        that of copies D and E (for more on this subject, see the Appendix,
                        “Emendations in the Foliation of the Morgan Copy, Chapter II,”
                        below). The erasures and alterations prove conclusively that Blake could not
                        have <pb id="p16-201" n="201"/> stumbled back into a First Order foliation
                        accidentally but must have done so deliberately.<ref target="n30" type="note">30</ref> A decisive endorsement of the First Order seems to
                        have been Blake’s last word on the form of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi><note id="n29"><hi rend="s">29</hi> Plate 30[<hi rend="i">34</hi>].</note><note id="n30"><hi rend="s">30</hi> The evidence of Blake’s
                            painstaking emendations to produce First Order numbers invalidates
                            Bentley’s hypothesis that Blake intended the Second Order scheme
                            for the plates of Chapter II in copy F “but carelessly copied the
                            former order when he numbered them with a pen” (<hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, p. 234).</note></p>
          <p>We cannot know for certain why he took this last step. Perhaps the
                        restoration of the original order reflects Blake’s tendency to
                        commemorate the firstlings of his conception and belongs with such
                        manifestations of the tendency as the restored “12” on the
                        title page of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and the date 1804 on the title page
                        of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> But it is also possible that verbal and
                        narrative continuity asserted new claims for Blake’s favor. Certainly
                        copy F, though elegantly touched up with China white, is a drab thing
                        compared to the extravagance of E, but as a reading text it is far
                            clearer.<ref target="n31" type="note">31</ref> We may surmise that Blake
                        considered E the viewer’s <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and F the
                        reader’s <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> In that case, a sequence
                        agreeable to the viewer might cause discomfort to the reader. The location
                        of plate 42 in the Second Order, for example, is wholly illogical from the
                        standpoint of narrative continuity, a point that Blake might have perceived
                        more forcefully as shapeliness of visual design receded somewhat in
                        importance to him. <note id="n31"><hi rend="s">31</hi> “The
                            retouching of rude mendings . . . is carried through more
                            conscientiously in the Morgan than in any other copy and rather less
                            conscientiously in the Mellon than any other. . . . Blake took more
                            pains to make the text legible in the Morgan copy than in the
                            Mellon” (Erdman, “Suppressed and Altered Passages,”
                            p. 41). Many plates are faintly printed, some (e.g., pl. 15) scarcely
                            legible, in copy E. The orangish ink also contributes more to the visual
                            splendor of the book than it does to ease of reading.</note></p>
          <p>Although we can only speculate about Blake’s motives for restoring the
                        First Order in F, we can refer to the evolutionary history of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, where a competition of two autonomies, the visual and
                        the verbal, goes on continually. Perhaps modern editors of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, faced with the choice of the two variant orders, should
                        first consider what sort of choice Blake himself was making as he moved from
                        one order to the other, what alternative goals he had before him, and they
                        should make their own editorial decisions accordingly. To establish a
                        “preferred” order of plates on extrinsic, mechanical
                        grounds—the order represented in the majority of copies, the one with
                        the most colors, the one produced last—is to neglect the principles
                        of ordering that would have mattered to Blake himself and to evade their
                        problematic nature. If there are such things as a reader’s <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and a viewer’s <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, then perhaps the wisest thing a future editor might do
                        is to follow the order of plates that best suits the alternative adopted.
                        If, for example, the edition is to be furnished with reproductions of the
                        illuminations (as in the recent Bentley edition)<ref target="n32" type="note">32</ref>, then the order of copy E, with its superior
                        disposition of designs, would be the one to follow; but if the edition is an
                        unilluminated letterpress text, then the order with the greatest verbal
                        coherence, such as we find in copy F, would be more appropriate. There is no
                        abstract “correct” order to the second chapter of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, but neither should our choice be arbitrary; the
                        appropriate order of the poem is profoundly related to the medium of its
                        transmission. <note id="n32"><hi rend="s">32</hi><hi rend="i"> William Blake’s Writings</hi>, ed. G.E. Bentley,
                            Jr., 2 vols. (Oxford: Clarendon, 1978).</note></p>
          <p>It may be disquieting to some to propose, in place of “the”
                        poem or “the preferred” poem, a plurality of <hi rend="i">Jerusalems</hi> offering faces that accord with the differing desires
                        of viewers and readers. But differing desires, pluralities, unfinished
                        competitions, these are the elements in which Blake breathes. The ordering
                        and reordering of sequences would be impossible in the first place if the
                        poem were not composed of dozens, perhaps scores of smaller poems,
                        internally autonomous but often covering portions of the same ground as the
                        others do: in short, competing with one another to tell the same story, to
                        offer the reader alternate versions of the same truth. And as scene competes
                        with scene, designs come to compete with text, new conceptions with old
                        conceptions, late copies with early copies, and the surface of the poem is
                        dislocated but then reorganized each time. Organization becoming firm in one
                        part often means disorganization somewhere else. This process is perfectly
                        imaged in the figure of “Golgonooza the spiritual Four-fold London
                        eternal . . . ever building, ever falling” (<hi rend="i">Milton</hi>
                        6.1-2), evading a petrified order. In most of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                        the building and rebuilding has arrested itself, leaving only archeological
                        traces of its earlier turbulent development. Chapter II is a gate into the
                        place where the building and rebuilding goes on, allowing us to clarify our
                        conjectures about what the process as a whole must have been like. It is the
                        place where Blake still allows a glimpse of his unappeasable appetite for an
                        unending conversation between strong text and strong design. “Go on,
                        builders in hope” (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 12.43), it seems to
                        proclaim.</p>
          <p>Appendix: Emendations in the MS Foliation of the Morgan Copy, Chapter II <q>
                            The matter of erased pen numbers in F needs a somewhat detailed
                            exposition, for the erasures and other emendations have not been
                            completely reported hitherto. Not all the plates subject to shuffling in
                            earlier arrangements of Chapter II show evidence of emendation beneath
                            the extant page numbers, but the mendings are more extensive than
                            previously realized. Erdman finds an erased number, “possibly
                            ‘33’ ” and mendings in the digits of
                            “30,” “31,” and “32”
                            (“Suppressed and Altered Passages,” p. 51). Close
                            attention to scouring marks on the paper, aided by an ultraviolet lamp,
                            has enabled me to collect more complete information (I am also indebted

                        numbers were those of the Second Order, and all tends to support it. The
                        probable “33” once inscribed on pl. 29, the
                        “4[?]” detectable on pl. 36, and the “[?]3”
                        detectable on pl. 38 raise no barrier to the supposition that these fossil
                        numbers were once the actual Second Order numbers of those plates, <hi rend="i">33, 40</hi>, and <hi rend="i">43</hi>, respectively. If Blake
                        was changing Second Order numbers to First Order, where the plate number was
                        in the 30’s in either Order, we would expect him to erase only the
                        second digit; both digits would need altering for <hi rend="i">40</hi> to
                        become 36; where the First Order catches up to the 40’s, as <hi rend="i">45</hi> becomes 40, Blake again would need only to change the
                        second digit. All these expectations are confirmed by the physical evidence
                        of the text. That they all point to Second Order numbers beneath the extant
                        mendings and superimposition seems beyond the reach of coincidence.</p>
          <p>As the table above makes clear, not all the plates show evidence of early
                        fossil numbers beneath the extant First Order numbers. But although the
                        early patterning of numbering was intermittent it was by no means random.
                        Plates 43[<hi rend="i">29</hi>]-46[<hi rend="i">32</hi>] and 47-50 show no
                        signs of earlier numbers; pl. 29 [<hi rend="i">33</hi>]-32[<hi rend="i">36</hi>], on the other hand, display such signs on every plate; pl.
                            33[<hi rend="i">37</hi>]-41[<hi rend="i">46</hi>] show a pattern of
                        early numbers on <hi rend="i">alternate</hi> plates in the series (pl. 42 is
                        included here as the fifth in the series), with the odds (assuming a likely
                        Second Order arrangement) skipped in the first half and the evens in the
                        second. One plausible way of accounting for these variations is to assume
                        that Blake numbered these plates in different batches and at different
                        times. It is interesting to note that these different batches of plates,
                        29-32, 33-41, 43-46, and 47-50 are virtual replicas of our old
                        acquaintances, those pre-fabricated units that came to form Chapter II of
                            <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> in the first place: respectively, the
                        four-plate introductory unit of Sequence 1, the nine-plate central panel of
                        the cathedral cities, the highly mobile Sequence 2 that ends with the
                        tableau of Vala and Jerusalem, and the immobile concluding Sequence 3. Did a
                        sense of the autonomous integrity of these units persist so distinctly in
                        Blake’s mind, even to the last, as to influence the way he initially
                        went about compiling copy F?

        <p>As Detlef W. Dörrbecker points out in “Fuseli, the Swiss, and the
                    British: Some Recent Publications,” the 1973 Zurich edition of
                    Fuseli’s poems, although not entirely complete, is nevertheless a
                    valuable addition to the expanding fund of knowledge concerning the poetic
                    output of the celebrated painter.<ref target="n33" type="note">1</ref>
                    Unfortunately, except for occasionally quoted passages, the poems have not been
                    translated and have received relatively little critical attention. To convey
                    something of the flavor of these poems, I have attempted to translate a few
                    representative samples, appended below. <note id="n33"><hi rend="s">1</hi>
                        Johann Heinrich Füssli, <hi rend="i">Sämtliche Gedichte</hi>,
                        ed. Martin Bircher and Karl S. Guthke (Zürich, 1973), reviewed by
                        Detlef W. Dörrbecker in “Fuseli, The Swiss, And The British:
                        Some Recent Publications,” <hi rend="i">Blake: An Illustrated
                            Quarterly</hi>, 15 (Summer 1981), 54-56.</note></p>
        <p>Modern critical evaluations of the poems, made largely by German or Swiss
                    commentators, are rather negative; usually, “the other side of his art,
                    the literary, is judged with a certain hesitancy” and considered
                    “time-bound, manneristic classicism.”<ref target="n34" type="note">2</ref> Eudo Mason, the scholar most instrumental in the
                    mid-twentieth-century Fuseli revival, reminds us, however, that Fuseli
                    “can never be fully understood, unless his writings are also taken into
                    account” and acknowledges Fuseli’s talents as translator,
                    aphorist, and critic while being somewhat less than enthusiastic over his
                        poems.<ref target="n35" type="note">3</ref> Yet although critical strictures
                    seem justified, the poems are nevertheless of interest to the historian as well
                    as to the comparatist, especially the latter, inasmuch as they permit insight
                    into the mind of a man who, like Faust, is of a divided soul, imbued by
                    “the passion for everything grand and cutting contempt for everything
                        mean,”<ref target="n36" type="note">4</ref> a man “in whose
                    daemonic personality exaltation was forever at war with an almost cynical
                        shrewdness,”<ref target="n37" type="note">5</ref> a man who was

        <p>To attempt an explanation of why Fuseli largely abandoned poetry in favor of the
                    visual arts must, of course, ultimately remain a matter of speculation. Yet
                    certain events in his life and in the culture of his time, as well as a
                    consideration of his personality, may serve to shed some light, at least, on why
                    he chose to concentrate on the representative arts. All signs in Fuseli’s
                    early life pointed to his becoming a man of letters. As a youngster, he was bred
                    to the ministry and seems to have shown promise as a teacher of considerable
                    rhetorical power. Indeed, “he regarded poetry as his true
                        vocation”<ref target="n38" type="note">6</ref> and, having attained
                    considerable proficiency in several languages, devoured not only the ancient
                    classics but also Shakespeare, Milton, and certain eighteenth-century English
                    poets. It was Fuseli’s good fortune to grow up in Zurich, then one of the
                    fortresses in the Germanic revolt against French neoclassicism. Johann
                    Bodmer—poet, translator of Milton, and one of the leaders of the
                    movement—introduced young Fuseli to the English poets considered such
                    admirable models in the fight against convention. Among contemporary German
                    poets, Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, the “German Milton,” was
                    young Fuseli’s favorite. He tried his hand at a Shakespearean tragedy,
                        <hi rend="i">The Death of Saul</hi> (now lost),<ref target="n39" type="note">7</ref> and, when barely twenty, created a sensation with his, at first
                    anonymously circulated, odes in the manner of Klopstock. Indeed, it was thought
                    that these odes were actually Klopstock’s; among those who knew better,
                    Johann Georg Zimmermann went so far as to claim that “compared to
                    Fuseli’s odes, many of Klopstock’s are like
                        ‘water.’”<ref target="n40" type="note">8</ref> And
                    Johann Kaspar Lavater, one of Fuseli’s best friends, ranks him equal to
                        Goethe.<ref target="n41" type="note">9</ref><note id="n38"><hi rend="s">6</hi> Mason, p. 15.</note><note id="n39"><hi rend="s">7</hi> Muschg, p. 19.</note><note id="n40"><hi rend="s">8</hi> Letter to Herder, 13 April 1775, in Heinrich

        <p>If such praise nowadays seems exaggerated, even stranger is the fact that it is
                    based on a mere handful of poems. According to Martin Bircher, of the 46 poems
                    in the 1973 Zurich edition, only 11 were published during Fuseli’s
                    lifetime. And although Fuseli never seems entirely to have given up writing or
                    at least revising his poetry, the bulk, 28 poems, was written prior to 1780,
                    with the decade from 1760 to 1770 being the most productive. Only 14 of
                    Fuseli’s poems can be assumed to have been written after 1800, and only
                    one after 1812.<ref target="n42" type="note">10</ref> Thus, after 1770 Fuseli
                    turned his back on poetry, except for a brief resurgence in late 1779 and early
                    1780, occasioned by an abortive love affair.<ref target="n43" type="note">11</ref><note id="n42"><hi rend="s">10</hi> Significantly, this is the English

                        Eye”).</note></p>
        <p>In terms of events, the years between 1762 and 1779 are the stormiest in
                    Fuseli’s life and artistically no doubt the most critical. Having
                    denounced a powerful Zurich official, Fuseli fled in 1763 from his native land,
                    spent some time in Germany, and in 1764 settled in England. There he was
                    initially very active in literary matters but also painted a great deal. In 1768
                    Sir Joshua Reynolds advised Fuseli to go to Italy and concentrate on painting.
                    Fuseli stayed in Italy from 1770 to 1778 and, after a brief visit to
                    Switzerland, returned to England in 1778, settling into a “golden
                        exile”<ref target="n44" type="note">12</ref>—golden certainly
                    as far as painting was concerned but not so propitious, it seems, for his
                    poetry. <note id="n44"><hi rend="s">12</hi><hi rend="i"> Gedichte</hi>, p. 106.</note></p>
        <pb id="p16-207" n="207"/>
        <p>To add any new insights to Dörrbecker’s evaluation of the poems and
                    his succinct presentation of their critical reception by others is impossible,
                    except that I should like to plead for a certain freshness and noble cadence in
                    Fuseli’s “Ode to His Friends Left Behind” (see below),
                    which seems to adumbrate that of Hölderlin. Elsewhere, to be sure, Fuseli
                    virtually never descends from the heights of rhetoric, indulging in a great deal
                    of hyperbole and excessively metaphoric language, especially in his penchant for
                    non-functional personification. At the time, of course, this was in perfectly
                    good taste, and even where he is irregular and strident, Fuseli moves safely
                    within the confines of <hi rend="i">Sturm und Drang</hi> language.</p>
        <p>Ironically enough, the impressions conveyed by the original poems do not always
                    come across in the translations. Thus I have refrained from rendering the
                    simple, lovely “Nannas Auge,” which would fall rather flat
                    —not surprising, of course, if one considers the untranslatable quality
                    of lyric poetry. On the other hand (but unfortunately I have no way of proving
                    this), the odes, so bombastic in the original, may actually seem somewhat less
                    so in English.</p>
        <p>Beyond the formal aspects of Fuseli’s poetry, its most salient
                    characteristic, as Dörrbecker points out, is the conventionality of
                        thought.<ref target="n45" type="note">13</ref> Although, as one can readily
                    see, Fuseli often sounds dreadfully daring, revolutionary, and even irrational,
                    such tactics were fast becoming conventional. His ideas are firmly rooted in
                    Englishtenment philosophy, for example, the Great Chain of Being mentioned in
                        “Patience.”<ref target="n46" type="note">14</ref> And even
                    while he strikes a Satanic pose in “Hell,” his seemingly
                    impressive attack nevertheless validates the great system; despite being overtly
                    “determinéd to be a villain,” Fuseli sanctions traditional
                    values. As with Blake, Milton’s Satan is Fuseli’s hero too, but,
                    according to Gert Schiff, Fuseli’s Satan is merely a convenient
                    “carrier of humanitarian protest against the suffering of the
                        world,”<ref target="n47" type="note">15</ref> which at the time of
                    the poem (after 1803) is not an over-whelmingly novel idea. Fuseli may simply

                    fact that “he had only an eighteenth-century diction to express a vision
                    that had passed far beyond all eighteenth-century limitations,”<ref target="n50" type="note">18</ref> Fuseli had in due time come to lack both

        <p>Yet although the merit of Fuseli’s poetic endeavors is at best debatable,
                    one cannot help but concede his obvious potential. If any artist thus doubly
                    gifted abandons one form of expression for the sake of the other, what may have
                    been his reasons? There are several possibilities. One of these may have been
                    that Fuseli acquired a second language. While English presents no overwhelming
                    difficulties to a native speaker of German, to attain polish and full
                    sensitivity to the new language does require time. (Here, of course, one is
                    immediately reminded of exceptions, such as that of Joseph Conrad who
                    successfully crossed a language barrier far more formidable than that between
                    German and English.) It may be remembered that Fuseli had begun to study English
                    at an early age, and throughout his life in England he wrote a good deal of
                    critical prose, as well as lecturing at the Royal Academy. His English prose
                    style has been deemed “assured, learned, lively, and economical, never
                    betraying the fact that German and not English was his native
                        tongue.”<ref target="n51" type="note">19</ref> On the other hand, he
                    virtually never attempted writing English verse.<ref target="n52" type="note">20</ref> Perhaps he was too proud to engage in a pursuit in which he must
                    have feared to come out second best or worse, a humiliation difficult to accept
                    for one who, like Satan, had been pampered and flattered in his youth. Even such
                    an intimate friend of Fuseli’s as Mary Wollstonecraft was forced to tell
                    him on a certain occasion “I hate to see that reptile Vanity sliming over
                    the noble qualities of your heart”;<ref target="n53" type="note">21</ref>
                    no doubt Fuseli’s pride and vanity led him to drink in Reynolds’
                    lavish praise and consequently to change vocations. In painting, of course, one
                    does not have to wrestle with accent and other verbal obstacles to
                    communication. But the objection that his new involvement may simply have left
                    him neither time nor inclination for poetry can be countered easily enough by
                    ample evidence of double talents functioning quite satisfactorily, of which
                    Blake’s is of course one of the best cases in point. And even though
                    Fuseli rejected English poetry as a vehicle of expression, he might at least
                    have continued to write German poetry. <note id="n51"><hi rend="s">19</hi>

        <p>Of all the commentators, Eudo Mason puts his finger most precisely on what seems
                    to have been the heart of Fuseli’s poetic problem, namely, that he turned
                    his back on literature at the very time when exciting breakthroughs were being
                    made by German and English poets. Fuseli not only turned traitor to his own
                    culture:“he lists, bragging a little on occasion, the names of English
                    poets and learned men against whom the Germans fall far short”<ref target="n54" type="note">22</ref>—this could be explained as some
                    sort of overcompensation for culture shock, but “throughout his life,
                    down to his old age, he seems to have clung to certain quasi-orthodox ideas
                    about the nature of God, the relationship of God to man, and the metaphysical
                    reality of sin, evil, and damnation.” This, according to Mason, kept
                    Fuseli from becoming a “real” romantic.<ref target="n55" type="note">23</ref><note id="n54"><hi rend="s">22</hi> Muschg, p. 30.</note><note id="n55"><hi rend="s">23</hi> Mason, pp. 14-17.</note></p>
        <p>What happened to Fuseli is an instructive example of what Morse Peckham calls
                    “neo-classic disintegration,”<ref target="n56" type="note">24</ref> a state perhaps less painful to the visual artist for, as E. H.
                    Gombrich suggests, “the terms ‘true’ and
                    ‘false’ can only be applied to statements. . . . a picture is
                    never a statement in that sense of the term.”<ref target="n57" type="note">25</ref> Had Fuseli mustered the courage, even at the risk of
                    losing face, to continue to break through Enlightenment restraints and to keep
                    up with the romantic avant-garde, he might have developed into a poet of
                    significance at least equal to that which he attained as a painter. <note id="n56"><hi rend="s">24</hi> Morse Peckham, <hi rend="i">The Triumph of

        <pb id="p16-208" n="208"/>
        <p>In light of these considerations, one is tempted to see in Blake’s epithet
                    “both Turk and Jew,” though jocular and friendly on the conscious
                    level, additional and even rather sinister meaning. Can Blake have sensed
                    somehow that Fuseli was an infidel of a different sort, having refused to grow
                    as a poet and thus having betrayed the splendid gift he demonstrated in his
                    youth, that he stonily ignored the progress made by poets at the highest
                    cultural level? Of course it is hardly possible that Blake was aware of the
                    existence of Fuseli’s poems, but Blake the clairvoyant was a man hard to
                    fool. There is something Urizenic in Fuseli’s pride, in his resolution to
                    slam the door on what was truly creative in the poetry of his time. The ideas
                    expressed in the following poems, as well as their style, would seem to lend
                    credence to such speculations.</p>

        <p>For nearly a century, copy B of William Blake’s <hi rend="i">America</hi>,
                    now in the Pierpont Morgan Library, has been considered by dealers, auction
                    houses, and scholars as a complete and uncolored copy with the full complement
                    of eighteen plates on eighteen leaves. Detailed examination of this copy has
                    revealed that two plates are, in fact, facsimiles, and were inserted in copy B
                    between 1874 and 1878, most probably with intent to deceive.</p>
        <p>In his <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>,<ref target="n63" type="note">1</ref> G.E.
                    Bentley,Jr. discusses the provenance of copy B, which was presented to the
                    Morgan by Mrs. Landon K. Thorne in 1973.<ref target="n64" type="note">2</ref>
                    The earliest evidence of ownership of this copy is a penned inscription on the
                    recto of the frontispiece (mistakenly located by Bentley on the verso of the
                    title-page), reading, “From the author / to C H Tatham Oct.<hi rend="s">r</hi>7 / 1799.” While this inscription was once thought to be in
                    Blake’s hand, later authorities have dismissed this claim. Bentley
                    suggests that copy B might be the one listed by Lowndes as having been sold by
                    “Sotheby, 1855, 2£.7s,” described only as a folio with 18
                        designs.<ref target="n65" type="note">3</ref> This otherwise unidentified
                    sale at Sotheby’s has not been traced. Evidently copy B was again sold
                    for £18 in 1874 (according to the note in the 1878 sale catalogue
                    reproduced below), although no trace of this transaction at auction or in dealer
                    catalogues has been found. <note id="n63"><hi rend="s">1</hi> G.E. Bentley, Jr.,

                    Sotheby’s on 29-30 January 1878, as lot 247: <q> 247 Blake (W.) America,

        <p>According to the notes in the Sotheby master catalogue deposited at the British
                    Library, lot 247 was sold to the London dealer John Pearson for £16.5.0.
                    The next traced appearance of copy B occured twelve years later, on 23 April
                    1890, when it was again offered by Sotheby’s, as lot 189 in the sale of
                    the library of Thomas Gaisford,<ref target="n67" type="note">5</ref> who had
                    presumably acquired the book from Pearson. At the Gaisford sale it fetched
                    £61 to the London firm of Bernard Quaritch, which added its customary
                    pencilled note to the rear flyleaf, “Collated and perfect/ Ap.<hi rend="s">1</hi> 24 90/ J.T.”<ref target="n68" type="note">6</ref>
                    Quaritch included copy B in catalogue 104, May 1890 (no. 460), from which it was
                    purchased for £68 by Bernard Buchanan Macgeorge. Interestingly enough,
                    Macgeorge had attempted to purchase copy B at the Gaisford sale and had given
                    his bid of £30 to Quaritch; it was not until the appearance of
                    Quaritch’s catalogue 104 the following month that the collector was
                    persuaded to pay more than twice his earlier bid. <note id="n67"><hi rend="s">5</hi> Thomas Gaisford, 1799-1855, Dean of Christ Church, Oxford. See

        <p>Let us return to the Dew-Smith sale catalogue, which contains the first printed
                    notice of copy B. There is no doubt that the copy under consideration is the one
                    described in the catalogue: the unusual inscription and the readily-identifiable
                    binding are both unique to this copy. The Dew-Smith sale entry enables us to
                    supply an approximate date for the binding of copy B: it must have been done
                    between 1874 when sold “unbound,” and 1878 when the elaborate
                    binding of “citron morocco, ornamented with variegated leathers and gilt
                    tooling” by Francis Bedford was so carefully described in the Dew-Smith
                    catalogue.</p>
        <p>There is a glaring ambiguity in that catalogue entry: it is not at all clear how
                    many plates were in copy B. As printed, the catalogue entry reads, “<hi rend="i">two plates said to be wanting, but Blake’s original
                        prospectus says</hi>—‘America, a Prophecy in illuminated
                    printing,’ <hi rend="i">folio, with 18 designs, Lambeth, W. Blake</hi>,
                    1793.” This phrase makes little sense. The conjunction
                    “but” should be used to connect two countering statements; in this
                    case, the second part, “America, a Prophecy in illuminated
                    printing” in no way contradicts or counters the statement that two leaves
                    are said to be wanting. This awkward and illogical sentence can be explained by
                    a simple printer’s error which removed the words “<hi rend="i">folio, with 18 designs</hi>” from the quotation of Blake’s
                    prospectus text and made the words appear a part of Sotheby’s sale entry.
                    The printer, evidently accustomed to setting type in the auction house’s
                    style, assumed that the number of leaves was Sotheby’s description of the
                    copy at hand rather than a part of the quotation. The meaning of the sentence is
                    obvious <pb id="p16-213" n="213"/> when one repairs Blake’s prospectus
                    description. It thus becomes clear that the Sotheby cataloguer could not
                    determine why two plates had at some earlier point been described as lacking,
                    when the copy before him agreed with the prospectus in having the full 18
                    plates. While the meaning of this description is clear, it has not proven
                    possible to locate any statement of imperfection: a note (since lost or erased)
                    in the volume, or a catalogue entry for the untraced 1874 sale are equally
                    plausible sources.</p>
        <p>The Sotheby cataloguer’s insecurity about the number of plates in copy B
                    can be explained by the fact that two plates are not a part of the original
                    volume: careful examination has revealed that plates 4 and 9 not only are not
                    original to this copy, but are facsimiles. Neither plate is sewn into the
                    binding as an integral leaf; instead, both leaves (in their correct positions)
                    are tipped in, pasted to adjacent leaves deep in the gutter of the volume. This
                    is most evident when turning pages: when plates 4 and 9 are turned, plates 5 and
                    10 obediently follow since they are joined by adhesive at the inner margins. The
                    remainder of the leaves in the volume, as one would expect of single bound
                    leaves, turn quite independently of their neighbors. Further, the two leaves in
                    question do not display the gilt edges of the rest of the volume, but form
                    minute gaps at the top, fore, and bottom edges; both plates are shorter than the
                    remaining leaves. As it is virtually impossible to apply matching gilt to a
                    single leaf, inserted leaves could never display the flawless gilding of the
                    edges of the bound leaves. It might be argued that the paper of plates 4 and 9
                    was merely shorter when bound than the remainder of the volume, and thus escaped
                    gilding; two suggestions can be made to show that this is unlikely. Before
                    gilding the edges of this book, the binder was scrupulously careful in cutting
                    and smoothing the edges to provide a perfectly flat surface for the gilt. A
                    binder of Francis Bedford’s reputation and ability would certainly not
                    have permitted these two leaves to remain shorter, but would have trimmed down
                    the remainder of the volume to even all edges. While we would gasp at giving a
                    binder such freedom today, brutally trimming all uncut edges and elaborately
                    gilding the edges was a perfectly normal—in fact, a desirable—way
                    of achieving a finer copy for the nineteenth-century collector.</p>
        <p>Another argument against plates 4 and 9 being an original part of copy B concerns
                    the sewing of the plates before binding. Once again, Bedford, a binder of the
                    highest quality, would have sewn the two leaves with the bulk of the volume (on
                    stubs, if necessary); it is unlikely that he would have simply glued them to
                    adjacent leaves. There is nothing to indicate that the original plates 4 and 9
                    were ever present: there are no stubs, and the binding is extremely tight. If
                    Blake’s original plates 4 and 9 were at some time extracted from copy B,
                    they are nowhere recorded as existing today. Since the binding was executed
                    between 1874 and 1878, the false plates 4 and 9 must also have been inserted
                    between those years.</p>
        <p>Further evidence to demonstrate the alien nature of plates 4 and 9 is found in
                    their hard and smooth wove paper, in general appearance similar to the wove
                    Whatman hand-made paper used in the remainder of the volume.<ref target="n69" type="note">7</ref> But the surface of plates 4 and 9 is far smoother and
                    does not show the fibrous surface of genuine Whatman paper; the paper of these
                    two plates is without a doubt machine made and is considerably stiffer than
                    Whatman paper. When viewed in a strong light, the paper is also considerably
                    browner in tone than the surrounding Whatman paper. Bentley’s description
                    of copy B in the Thorne catalogue<ref target="n70" type="note">8</ref> notes
                    that (only) “plate 9 seems to be on stiffer paper than the rest”;
                    Joseph Viscomi noticed the same difference in thickness of plates 4 and 9 when
                    examining copy B in 1978, suggesting in conversation with me that these two
                    plates were from another copy of <hi rend="i">America.</hi> After more detailed
                    examination it became clear to me that the two plates were not authentic. It is
                    interesting to note that Bentley deleted his question about the thickness of the
                    paper when incorporating the Thorne catalogue description into <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> and evidently felt no doubts as to authenticity. This is
                    not at all surprising, since both facsimile leaves are of very high quality.
                        <note id="n69"><hi rend="s">7</hi> Watermarks appear on only five of the
                        sixteen genuine plates, but measurement of paper thickness has demonstrated
                        that Whatman paper was used throughout. Were it not for matching stabholes I
                        would be tempted to suggest that the titlepage was substituted from another
                        copy: it alone has an obvious central horizontal crease, and it alone is
                        touched—unconvincingly and with disregard for the design—with
                        grey wash.</note><note id="n70"><hi rend="s">8</hi> G.E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">The Blake

                        Library, 1971), pp. 26-27.</note></p>
        <p>Copy B has been variously foliated in pencil—not by Blake—at the
                    upper right corner of each sheet (1-18) and at the lower left corner of each
                    design. Both foliations have been erased and rewritten at various times, all
                    before acquisition by the Morgan. Written below the upper right foliation on
                    plates 4 and 9 appear what could be described as a penciled European
                    “7” with a crossbar, but which may more plausibly be described as
                    a capital “F,” perhaps indicating the word
                    “Facsimile.” It is telling that no other plates in copy B display
                    these markings. Further evidence is provided by the foliation at the lower left,
                    which omits plates 4 and 9 entirely, resulting in a count of 16 plates.<ref target="n71" type="note">9</ref><note id="n71"><hi rend="s">9</hi> Further examination of the foliation of the
                        sixteen genuine plates may reveal a different arrangement of the plates
                        before binding, as some erased numbers quite out of sequence are still
                        discernible at the lower left.</note></p>
        <p>The printing ink of the two plates is a dull, dark brownish-black, similar in
                    color to the ink used in the remainder of copy B. When compared with original
                    Blake pulls, however, the printing ink of the spurious leaves appears flat and
                    without surface. Both the flatness of ink and the quality of impression make it
                    evident that these two plates were not printed by Blake’s method of
                    relief etching. Authentic pulls show the ink impressed into the surface of the
                    sheet to such an extent that a clear blind impression of both design and text is
                    visible on the verso of each plate. The versos of plates 4 and 9 are smooth and
                    unblemished.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most conclusive evidence against the authenticity of plates 4 and 9
                    is an obvious platemark, measuring 22.8 × 17 cm. (plate 4) and 24.7
                    × 17.5 cm. (plate 9). There would be no justification for such a
                    platemark on an original pull by Blake, since the size of the artist’s
                    copper plates generally determined the size of his image: for him, margins were
                    undesirable, whether on financial or aesthetic grounds. Bentley and others have
                    discussed the likelihood of Blake using both sides of some of his copper plates,
                    as evidenced by close similarities in size and by the presence of maker’s
                    stamps (usually found on the backs of copper plates).<ref target="n72" type="note">10</ref> The only instances of substantial margins in

        <p>The impossibility of the platemark dimensions on plates 4 and 9 can readily be
                    shown on plate 4, where the lower portion of the design was masked by Blake in
                    the printing of most copies, so the area beneath the crouching figure is without
                    the four-line sentiment (so masked in copies C-F, H-M, R, a, and the single
                    Morgan pull). In genuine impressions of this plate, an examination of the
                    surface of the paper will demonstrate that this area was masked by placing a
                    slip of paper over the inked plate; under raking light one can, in fact, see the
                    blind impression of its deckle edge in the single Morgan pull. There is abundant
                    evidence that the original copper plate was not simply cut off to delete this
                    part of the plate. On genuine impressions the copper can be shown to extend 40
                    mm. below the tip of the man’s foot; in copy B the platemark is clearly
                    visible 24 mm. below the foot, locating what would be the bottom of the copper
                    plate in the middle of the text lines.</p>
        <p>Facsimiles—particularly Blake facsimiles—deserve more study. In
                    general, the earliest facsimiles of printed book pages were pen-and-ink
                    facsimiles, often sophisticated redrawings of type. In the case of Blake, such
                    work (as in <hi rend="i">Works by William Blake</hi>) is readily identifiable by
                    comparison with known originals. In the field of early printed books, the most
                    accomplished and annoying facsimilist was John Harris, who worked in England in
                    the mid-nineteenth century, primarily on sixteenth-century religious works. His
                    earliest method was to prepare a tracing of the original leaf to be copied, to
                    transfer the design with a stylus or carbon-like paper to a sheet of
                    appropriately old paper, and to fill in the letters by hand with pen-and-ink.
                    His later technique involved the use of a very lightly printed photolithograph
                    of the page to be reproduced, which was darkened by hand with ink, to form a
                    remarkable facsimile. It is said that he was at times unable to tell his
                    facsimile leaves from originals, and he therefore later insisted on signing his
                    facsimiles with his initials in a lower corner.</p>
        <p>Facsimiles relying on photographic means can be divided into two types: those
                    printed planographically (as lithographs, printed from one surface) and those
                    printed relief (as from zinc blocks). There is no indication that intaglio
                    technique was used for the facsimiles in copy B. Photolithographic prints could
                    be printed from litho stones, or from zinc plates (known as photozincographs).
                    Photorelief blocks were, confusingly enough, also known as zincographs, but the
                    difference in printing is crucial.</p>
        <p>Whichever process was used for plates 4 and 9, there is no doubt that it was
                    rooted in photography. Photolithography is, I feel, the more likely process used
                    for these leaves: that process was executed by photographing an original design,
                    transferring the photographic image to a photosensitive litho stone or zinc
                    plate, and printing that plate or stone through the lithographic (planographic)
                    process. Photolithography was in common use by the 1860s when Henry James
                    instituted the use of “photozincography” for the reproduction of
                    detailed ordnance maps for the British government.<ref target="n73" type="note">11</ref> The extreme detail obtained was “such that the greatest
                    error in a photozincographic reduction did not amount to 1/400 part of an inch,
                    a quantity quite inappreciable, and much less than the error due to the
                    contraction of the paper on which the maps were printed.”<ref target="n74" type="note">12</ref> Because of James’ successful use of
                    the process and at his urging, a photozincographic facsimile of Domesday Book
                    appeared, demonstrating that the process was already considered suitable for the
                    making of exact facsimiles. By the 1880s the technique was totally accepted:
                    William Griggs employed it for his esteemed series of Shakespeare quarto
                    facsimiles, the principal feature of which was exact duplication, barring the
                    variations inherent in paper shrinkage and stretching, and the vagaries of the
                    photographic process. The exact dimensions of the images on plates 4 and 9 of
                    copy B vary somewhat from those of originals, but such variation amounts to less
                    than 2% and can be explained by any of the factors mentioned above. The
                    smoothness of impression argues for a photolithographic process; I have not
                    encountered a craftsman or artist able to differentiate between impressions from
                    stone and those from zinc plates. <note id="n73"><hi rend="s">11</hi> See the
                        biography of James in the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of National

                    1970).</note></p>
        <p>It is also possible that the two plates were printed from relief zinc blocks
                    (also known as linecuts or lineblocks), which are made by transferring a
                    photographic image to a photosensitive sheet of metal. The unexposed areas are
                    etched away, leaving a raised metal surface from which to print with a normal
                    printing press. The plate is mounted on a type-high block of wood for printing.
                    This process is suggested by the overinking on plate 9 around the periphery of
                    the design; on the other hand, there is no trace of impression on the versos of
                    plates 4 and 9 to indicate a relief process.</p>
        <p>Neither process would explain the presence of plate-marks on these two
                    impressions. If printed lithographically from stone there would be only a slight
                    smoothing of the surface of the paper from the stone; if printed from zinc
                    plates there might be a slightly more defined platemark, but barely visible.
                    There is no justification for any platemark if the plates were printed from
                    relief blocks. It may be that in a mistaken understanding of Blake’s
                    technique, a false platemark was applied by running the dampened sheets through
                    a rolling (etching) press next to a sheet of metal, the edges of which would
                    impress a noticeable indentation into the paper.<ref target="n75" type="note">13</ref><note id="n75"><hi rend="s">13</hi> A curious example of false lithographic
                        platemarks is described by Michael Twyman, “A Note on some
                        Lithographic Stones relating to Alken’s <hi rend="i">Ideas and
                            Notions</hi>,” <hi rend="i">Journal of the Printing Historical

        <p>In any case, it is virtually certain that a photographic process was used in the
                    preparation of these facsimile leaves, for minute flaws and printing spots quite
                    incidental to Blake’s designs are reproduced with astonishing fidelity.
                    It would, in fact, serve little purpose to illustrate the two facsimile leaves
                    in their entirety here, since they would appear virtually indistinguishable from
                    originals. Some small details, however, are lost in the reproductions, most
                    noticeably the two small birds hovering in the sky on plate 9, between text and
                    tree boughs in the center of the plate.</p>
        <pb id="p16-215" n="215"/>
        <p>It has not proven possible to identify positively the copy (or copies) of <hi rend="i">America</hi> from which these two facsimile leaves were made. Plate
                    4 in copy B shows certain affinities with that plate in copy F (British Museum
                    Print Room), which is uncolored, and which has been available since 1859. In
                    particular, the broken flourish of the top of letter “S” beginning
                    the text appears to be an identifying feature, as are other spots and printing
                    flaws. Such a close relationship does not appear between the facsimile of plate
                    9 and that plate in copy F, where there are distinct differences. The birds
                    beneath the tree boughs are absent in the facsimile, and other details of inking
                    also differ.</p>
        <p>When the dubious nature of plates 4 and 9 in copy B was pointed out to Robert N.
                    Essick, he informed me that in his Blake collection are impressions of the same
                    two plates, purchased by him as facsimiles. The ink, impression, and images are
                    identical to plates 4 and 9 in copy B. Essick acquired these leaves from the
                    London firm of antiquarian booksellers, Walter T. Spencer &amp; Co., in whose
                    stock they were found without further identification, and where it is believed
                    they had lain for many years.</p>
        <p>I have not been able to identify the maker of the two facsimile leaves in copy B.
                    The facsimiles were certainly made in England, where (if, indeed, it was the
                    model) copy F was available to scholars, collectors, and dealers during the
                    period of 1874-1878. I have no doubt that photographic services were available
                    at that time, although I have not examined the records of the British Library to
                    verify this. No known facsimilist of Blake’s works can be connected to
                    copy B.</p>
        <p>William Muir, the leading facsimilist of Blake, was active beginning only in the
                    1880s; in fact, no facsimiles of any of Blake’s works are known to date
                    from the 1870s. It appears that those involved with Blake’s illuminated
                    printing were less concerned with completing individual copies than they were in
                    making Blake’s works available to a wider audience (this in spite of the
                    fact that the reviewer of a Muir facsimile wrote in the <hi rend="i">Times</hi>
                    of 29 July 1886, “All the world does not admire Blake, but then
                    [Muir’s] edition of fifty copies is not for all the world”).<ref target="n76" type="note">14</ref><note id="n76"><hi rend="s">14</hi> Unnumbered advertising brochure of Blake
                        materials issued by Bernard Quaritch, dated Nov. 1886.</note></p>
        <p>It would be tempting to associate John Pearson, the first recorded dealer to
                    handle copy B, with the making of these facsimiles, as he is known to have been
                    responsible for various other facsimiles. Pearson was active in the London Book
                    trade from about 1870, and is known to have handled at least three copies of <hi rend="i">America</hi> between 1878 and 1896: he owned copy B in 1878, copy D
                    between 1886 and 1888 (he had difficulty in disposing of this copy, offering it
                    in catalogues for £52, later for £45, and finally auctioning it off
                    for £23 in 1888), and copy E in 1896. But evidence shows it is unlikely he
                    was involved with the facsimiles since they were both present in copy B when he
                    purchased it at auction in the Dew-Smith sale in 1878. If the shadowy sales of
                    1855 and 1874 could be identified, further light might be shed by the names of
                    sellers and purchasers. It would also be tempting to associate the firm of
                    Walter T. Spencer with the preparation of these facsimiles, since Essick
                    purchased his two leaves from their stock, and, as Bentley has shown, the firm
                    was responsible for the fraudulent coloring of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (L) and
                        <hi rend="i">America</hi> (Q).<ref target="n77" type="note">15</ref> In
                    collecting circles it is generally known that the firm was less than careful in
                    informing customers about the presence of facsimiles, and it handled a fair
                    number of works by Blake. However, no evidence connects Spencer with the
                    facsimiles in copy B; it is not known whether company records exist. <note id="n77"><hi rend="s">15</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Books</hi>, pp. 105-06.</note></p>
        <p>It is also somewhat obscure why these facsimile leaves were made, other than the
                    obvious desire to complete an imperfect copy. It seems unlikely to have been for
                    financial reasons, as the sums involved were never great. Copy B (uncolored)
                    sold for £16.5.0 in 1878, copy L (uncolored) sold for £21 in 1879,
                    copy R (colored) sold for £31.10.0 in 1880, and poor copy D finally fetched
                    £23 in 1888. One wonders if the relatively small sums merited the
                    production of what must have been expensive facsimiles. It is only possible to
                    surmise that an English dealer or collector was responsible for the facsimiles;
                    the fact that the two plates were nowhere described as facsimiles can only lead
                    one to the inescapable conclusion that they were intended to deceive.</p>
        <p>One further—and puzzling—inscription in copy B should be noted. On
                    the free front endpaper, an unidentified hand has written in now-smudged pencil,
                    “Lowndes gives 18 designs. There are two more in some copies but I
                    believe these to be supplementary numbers and that the book as published had
                    only 18.” No copy of <hi rend="i">America</hi> is known to have had more
                    than eighteen plates, nor are the three known proof plates likely to be what is
                    meant in the inscription.<ref target="n78" type="note">16</ref> They are unique
                    proofs, one heavily corrected by Blake, and must represent false starts on
                    Blake’s part: the images are much improved in the published versions.
                    There is, in fact, no copy of <hi rend="i">any</hi> of Blake’s work in
                    illuminated printing with twenty plates. While it might be argued that the
                    Sotheby cataloguer for the Dew-Smith sale incorporated this curious note in his
                    description for the catalogue, the above evidence demonstrating the insertion of
                    plates 4 and 9 make this unlikely. <note id="n78"><hi rend="s">16</hi> These
                        proofs are reproduced in David V. Erdman, <hi rend="i">The Illuminated
                            Blake</hi> (New York: Doubleday, 1974), pp. 392-95.</note></p>
        <p>It thus appears that these two facsimile leaves, reproduced by a fundamentally
                    photographic process, were inserted in copy B of <hi rend="i">America</hi>
                    between 1874 and 1878 and have escaped detection by all owners and scholars
                    before identification by Joseph Viscomi and myself in 1978. The quality of
                    reproduction is so deceptive that the facsimiles went undetected in exhibitions
                    at the National Gallery (1913), Manchester (1914), Nottingham (1914), the
                    National Gallery of Scotland (1914), the Fogg exhibition (1930), the
                    Philadelphia exhibition (1939), and at various exhibitions at the Morgan
                    Library, including that of the Thorne Collection (1971), in the catalogue of
                    which both facsimile leaves were reproduced as genuine. One can only wonder what
                    other facsimiles have for so long remained undetected.<ref target="n114" type="note">17</ref><note id="n114"><hi rend="s">17</hi> I would like to thank Herbert Cahoon,

        <p>In 1927 the copy of Blake’s <hi rend="i">America</hi> we now know as copy
                    L was sold as a “facsimile reprint” for £4, though it is
                    quite genuine.<ref target="n79" type="note">1</ref> It is not unheard of for an
                    original work of art to be sold as a facsimile, but it is certainly more common
                    for a facsimile to be sold as an original. The authenticity of plates 4 and 9 of
                        <hi rend="i">America</hi> copy B, in the Pierpont Morgan Library, has never
                    been doubted in print. But in fact neither one is an original impression.
                    Although both are facsimiles photomechanically reproduced on wove paper, very
                    little about either image appears suspicious. Indeed, both are reproduced in <hi rend="i">The Blake Collection of Mrs. Landon K. Thorne.</hi><ref target="n80" type="note">2</ref> The true technical and historical origins
                    of plates 4 and 9 are not easily identified. What information we have is
                    supplied only from the plate measurements and foliation, the binding, and the
                    inscription on the front flyleaf of copy B. From these few facts, and with much
                    caution, we can begin to speculate about who executed the plates, when, how, and
                    why. <note id="n79"><hi rend="s">1</hi> G.E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake

          <p>Plates 4 and 9 are printed on the same paper, the feel, weight, and texture
                        of which are, from the verso, noticeably different from the other sheets in
                        the book. The paper—which called to mind Murillo, an etching paper I
                        had printed on before—and not the image, made me suspicious enough to
                        check some measurements.<ref target="n81" type="note">3</ref> As in most
                        copies of <hi rend="i">America</hi>, the last four lines of plate 4 have
                        been masked out. Unlike all other copies, however, the bottom platemark is
                        only 2.4 cm. from Orc’s foot, instead of the usual 4.1 cm. If this
                        bottom platemark were caused by the material used to mask out the four
                        lines, then, because 2.4 cm. is not wide enough, half of line 3 and all of
                        line 4 would have printed. If this were the platemark of an authentic
                        impression, then Blake’s plate had been cut in about the middle of
                        the third line, a possibility not yet to be ruled out since the plate could
                        have been pulled posthumously and there is precedent for such plate
                            tampering.<ref target="n82" type="note">4</ref> To make sure I was not
                        looking at a late impression or posthumous pull, I also checked the distance
                        in plate 4 from the top platemark to Orc’s toe: 19.5 cm. in copies A
                        and L, but 20.4 cm. in copy B. In plate 9, the distance from the top
                        platemark to the first line is 11.6 cm. in copy L, but 12.0 cm. in copy B;
                        from the bottom of the text to the bottom platemark is 8.4 cm. in copies A
                        and L, but 9.15 cm. in copy B. Because the relation of image to platemark
                        did not check out, I measured the distance between parts within the image.
                        For example, line 4 of plate 4 is 12.6 cm. long in copies A and L, but 13.0
                        cm. in copy B. Line 7 of plate 9 is 11.5 cm. long in copies A and L, but
                        11.9 in copy B.<ref target="n83" type="note">5</ref> More revealing than
                        incorrect measurements within the image and between image and platemarks,
                        however, are the plate measurements themselves. Plate 4 of copy B is 22.9
                        × 16.9 cm. vs. 23.8 × 16.6 cm., and plate 9 of copy B is 24.9
                        × 17.5 cm. vs. 23.5 × 16.8 cm.<ref target="n84" type="note">6</ref> These and other differences are too great to have been the
                        result of one paper shrinking less than the others. Damp printing paper
                        shrinks only 1 to 2.5% of the sheet size,<ref target="n85" type="note">7</ref> which could not, for example, account for the 1.4 cm.
                        difference between the length of plate 9 of copy B (24.9 cm.) and of copy A
                        (23.5 cm.). <note id="n81"><hi rend="s">3</hi> Thomas Lange, the assistant
                            curator in charge of books and prints at the Pierpont Morgan Library in
                            1978, also noticed the difference in paper and suspected the two plates.
                            Bentley seems to have been a bit puzzled by the difference too, but
                            noted only that plate 9 was printed on “stiffer paper than the
                            rest” (<hi rend="i">Thorne Catalogue</hi>, p. 26).</note><note id="n82"><hi rend="s">4</hi> In the posthumous pull of “The

                            information. He and G.E. Bentley, Jr. have read early drafts of this
                            paper and have made valuable suggestions, many of which have been
                            incorporated in this final version.</note><note id="n84"><hi rend="s">6</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Books</hi>, p. 70.</note><note id="n85"><hi rend="s">7</hi> Philip Gaskell, <hi rend="i">A New

          <p>Except for the platemarks, plates 4 and 9 are free of the embossment that is
                        characteristic of a relief etching, or a process block. Instead, the ink
                        lies flat on the paper, which is characteristic of lithography. The
                        platemarks are themselves suspicious, as I’ll explain later, and do
                        not positively identify the kind of lithography used. But whether these
                        impressions were pulled from stone or metal plates, whether produced from a
                        transfer or directly from a reverse negative, one thing is certain: they are
                        photolithographs. The proportion of the parts to each other is correct,
                        which indicates the work of a camera. But compared to the originals, the
                        overall dimensions are slightly distorted, or elongated, which indicates
                        either the slight distortion in the negative caused by the camera lens or in
                        the contact between the transfer paper and the stone. In any event, with a
                        photomechanically reproduced image, a good solid black ink (and not the
                        thinner greyish black of tonal lithography), an impression that has been
                        touched up in black water color (like the other prints in copy B), and
                        platemarks, it is little wonder that these two plates have escaped
                        detection.</p>

          <p><hi rend="i">America</hi> copy B was stabbed through two different sets of
                        three holes. Plates 4 and 9, however, have no stab holes, though both plates
                        are numbered. Copy B has two sets of <pb id="p16-220" n="220"/> numbers:
                        1-16 and 1-18. Both sets are in pencil and start on plate 1, and neither set
                        is by Blake or C.H. Tatham, the first owner of copy B.<ref target="n86" type="note">8</ref> Numbers 1-16 are written just below the platemark on
                        the left hand side; numbers 1-18 are written at the top right corner of the
                        leaf. Plates 4 and 9 are the two plates not in the 1-16 sequence, which
                        indicates that 1-16 is the set of numbers first given to the plates.<ref target="n87" type="note">9</ref> Plates 4 and 9 are numbered in set II,
                        and just below “4” and “9” is a
                            “7”.<ref target="n88" type="note">10</ref> That plates 4
                        and 9 are not included in the first set of numbers, and that neither sheet
                        has stab holes, suggest that copy B had for a time only sixteen plates to
                        number and stitch. <note id="n86"><hi rend="s">8</hi> On the verso of the
                            frontispiece is the inscription: “From the author/C H Tatham Octr
                            7/1799.” Presumably this is Tatham’s hand; it is not
                            Blake’s. In any case, the “7” and “9”
                            do not resemble the “7” and “9” in either
                            set of numbers. Blake did number two copies of <hi rend="i">America</hi>
                            (A and M) 1-16, but he started on plate 3, not plate 1, and numbered, as
                            was his custom, in the right hand corner of the plate in ink.</note><note id="n87"><hi rend="s">9</hi> The numbers of set I may not, however,
                            have been the first attempt at pagination. Numbers 4, 5, 7, and 11 of
                            set I are written over other numbers, or marks, that were erased;
                            numbers 6 and 8 are very light, and a 7-like mark is written over the
                            3.</note><note id="n88"><hi rend="s">10</hi> The “7” is the same size
                            (.6 cm.) and in the same position (2 cm.) from the edge of the sheet,
                            right under the number). In plate 4, the bottom of the number is partly
                            erased, or smudged. There is a larger smudge mark just under the
                            “7” on plate 9. This “7” may be a
                            printer’s mark rather than a number.</note></p>

          <p><hi rend="i">America</hi> was “splendidly bound in Citron
                        morocco” when it sold in 1878 with the library of A.G. Dew-Smith at
                        Sotheby’s for £16.5 (lot 247) to John Pearson. According to the
                        Sotheby catalogue, copy B sold in 1874, unbound, for £18. Being bound
                        by 1878 would seem to imply that the facsimiles were executed before this
                        date, but this is not necessarily the case, because plates 4 and 9 are not
                        in the binding but are tipped in. They are glued to plates 5 and 10, are
                        without gilding, and are slightly lower than the rest of the pages,
                        noticeable only when looking along the foreedge. The facsimiles enter after,
                        not before, the binding.<ref target="n89" type="note">11</ref><note id="n89"><hi rend="s">11</hi> The pages were trimmed before insertion.
                            The two leaves are slightly lower at the top, and less so at the bottom.
                            They appear flush with the fore-edge, but are actually a fraction lower,
                            noticeable when the fore-edge is riffled.In short, plates 4 and 9 were
                            cut and trimmed separate from the other sheets.</note></p>
          <p>The tipping-in of plates 4 and 9 indicates that one of the owners after 1878
                        could also have been responsible for their execution and insertion. Three of
                        these owners had access to facsimilists and to models, and had reason enough
                        to complete an incomplete copy. John Pearson, the bookseller, published the
                        excellent <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> facsimiles with 100 photolithographs
                        in 1877, and was William Muir’s first agent, issuing four of
                        Muir’s Blake facsimiles in 1884-85. Bernard Quaritch, who owned the
                        book in 1890, was Muir’s agent in 1885-94, and issued a series of
                        facsimiles by William Griggs from his own and other collections, including
                            <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> (1890) and <hi rend="i">The Book of
                            Ahania</hi> (1892). He also owned another copy of <hi rend="i">America</hi> (R), which he lent Muir for his 1887 facsimile. Bernard
                        Macgeorge, who owned the copy from 1892 to 1924, also knew Muir; Macgeorge
                        lent Muir <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> copy A, which was then missing five
                        plates, and which were “all supplied in facsimile by
                            Muir.”<ref target="n90" type="note">12</ref> Macgeorge also owned

                            collector (<hi rend="i">Thorne Catalogue</hi>, p. 14). Gaisford died in
                            1855, yet his bookplate is pasted on the inside of the front board,
                            which is why Keynes and Bentley have assumed that <hi rend="i">America</hi> (B) was “acquired by Gaisford” after it
                            was bound, and between Pearson, who bought it at Sotheby’s in
                            1878, and Quaritch, who bought it from Gaisford’s library, which
                            sold at Sotheby’s 23 April 1890. We do not know who acquired <hi rend="i">America</hi> (B) for Gaisford’s library, when, from
                            whom, or for how much. There are other Blake books with
                            Gaisford’s bookplate, four of which may have been acquired before
                            1855 (<hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> [H], <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> [E], <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> [C], <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> [N]),
                            and at least three, besides <hi rend="i">America</hi> (B), acquired

          <p>Before eliminating suspects, we must examine a pencil inscription on the
                        front flyleaf: <q> Lowndes [pens?] 18 designs<ref target="n92" type="note">14</ref><lb/> There are 2 more in some copies<lb/> but I believe
                            these to be a supplementary number<lb/> &amp; that the book is perfect

                                1793, Sotheby’s, 1855, <hi rend="i">£
                                    2.7</hi>”—<hi rend="i">W.T. Lowndes, The
                                    Bibliographer’s Manual of English Literature</hi> (1857),
                                I, 215.</note></q> Assuming “is only 18” refers back to
                        “designs” and not to £18, the price the 1878 Sotheby
                        catalogue says it sold for in 1874, the inscription can still be read in one
                        of two ways, depending on whether “designs” refers to pictures
                        or pages. In the Prospectus, Blake uses the word “design” to
                        mean picture, not plate or page.<ref target="n93" type="note">15</ref><hi rend="i">America</hi>, minus plates 4 and 9, would still have eighteen
                        designs if, as Blake himself did with the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi>, one
                        were to separately count the top and bottom pictures on two plates as
                        separate designs. By counting in this way, there would, indeed, be
                        “some copies” with “2 more” designs, whereas in
                        fact there are no copies with twenty plates. If, on the other hand,
                        “designs” is referring to pages, then the inscription is
                        referring to a copy in which the two facsimiles have already been inserted,
                        a copy, in other words, with eighteen plates. In this second interpretation,
                        the statement “There are 2 more in some copies” is probably a
                        reference to Gilchrist’s description of <hi rend="i">America</hi> as
                        “a folio of 20 pages.”<ref target="n94" type="note">16</ref><note id="n93"><hi rend="s">15</hi> In the Prospectus, Blake says that <hi rend="i">America</hi> has 18 designs, but he also says that <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> has 14 designs
                            (counting top and bottom illustrations on one plate—probably
                            plate 3—as separate designs), and not 27 plates, and that the <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> has 8 designs, not
                            11 plates or pages. In other words, Blake is using the word
                            “design” to mean picture, counting illustrations on one
                            plate which are independent of one another as separate designs. <hi rend="i">America</hi> has 18 pages and at least 18 designs, and
                            therein lies the confusion.</note><note id="n94"><hi rend="s">16</hi><hi rend="i"> Life of Blake</hi> (London, 1863), I, 109.
                            Gilchrist’s description of <hi rend="i">America</hi> as “a
                            folio of 20 pages” is most likely derived from Richard
                            Thomas’s description of <hi rend="i">America</hi> in <hi rend="i">Nollekens and His Times</hi> (London, 1828), II, 477, as having
                            “18 plates, or twenty pages, including the frontispiece and
                            titlepage.”</note></p>
          <p>The inscription is written on a flyleaf, thus written after the book is
                            bound.<ref target="n95" type="note">17</ref> The insertion of plates 4
                        and 9 also follows the binding, but may precede or follow the inscription.
                        There are only two possible combinations of these three bibliographical
                        facts: binding, inscription, insertion, or binding, insertion, inscription.
                        If the inscription precedes the insertion, the inscription refers to a copy
                        that still has only sixteen plates. If the inscription succeeds the
                        insertion, the inscription refers to a book with eighteen plates. Neither
                        combination rules out the possiblility of the inscription and / or insertion
                        occuring after 1878—unless we can date the inscription. <note id="n95"><hi rend="s">17</hi> The inscription is on the verso of the
                            front flyleaf, which is the conjugated part of the end paper pasted to
                            the front board. Because Blake’s original
                            “bindings” were simply wrappers of laid paper, and I do
                            not know of any copy of an illuminated book which has its original
                            wrappers plus a leather binding, I am assuming that the inscription, as
                            well as Gaisford’s bookplate, are on material supplied by the
                            binder, and thus were added to the book no earlier than 1874.</note></p>
          <p>The Sotheby catalogue entry for the 29 January 1878 auction and a comparison
                        of the numbers in set II with those in the inscription make me believe that
                        the inscription followed the insertion of the plates. The catalogue entry
                        describes copy B as: <q> . . . presentation copy with author’s
                            autograph inscription, splendidly bound in Citron morocco, ornamented
                            with variegated leathers and gold tooling, e.g. by F. Bedford; two
                            leaves said to be wanting, but Blake’s original prospectus says
                                “<hi rend="i">America</hi>, a prophecy in illuminated
                            printing, folio, with 18 designs, Lambeth, W. Blake, 1793.” This
                            copy, unbound, sold for £18 in 1874. </q> The cataloguer’s
                        “two leaves said to be wanting” seems to refer to the
                        assertion in the inscription that “There are 2 more in some
                        copies.” If so, the inscription was already written by 1878. And his
                            “<hi rend="i">but</hi> Blake’s original prospectus
                        says” clearly implies that two leaves are not wanting, that this copy
                        of <hi rend="i">America</hi> has 18 plates, the number that the prospectus
                        says it should. The idea that the cataloguer is counting pages rather than
                        illustrations is supported by internal evidence. As I mentioned, the two
                        sets of plate-numbering are by different hands, but the “8” in
                        the inscription—a very distinct <inline-image n="016-04-p220-8-delta"><figTranscr>8</figTranscr></inline-image>—is, I believe, the same
                        “8” in numbers “8” and “18” of the
                        second set of plate-numberings.</p>
          <p>If the inscription is pre-1878 and is written by the same person who
                        renumbered the plates, then the two facsimiles <pb id="p16-221" n="221"/>
                        must have entered <hi rend="i">America</hi> copy B between 1874, when it is
                        reported to have been unbound, and January 1878, by which time it was bound
                        and in Dew-Smith’s library. Who bought copy B in 1874 is unknown; it
                        may or may not have been Dew-Smith. Thus plates 4 and 9 could have been
                        inserted either before or during Dew-Smith’s ownership.<ref target="n96" type="note">18</ref> In the first case, someone other than
                        Dew-Smith purchased copy B in 1874, had it bound, inserted plates 4 and 9,
                        and, possibly, even wrote the inscription and renumbered the plates. In the
                        second case, Dew-Smith bought the volume either bound with sixteen plates,
                        or unbound in 1874 and had it bound, only to find out later that it was
                        missing plates 4 and 9. He had the two plates made, inserted them, and
                        described his copy as perfect. But it is also possible that Dew-Smith wrote
                        the inscription and renumbered the pages in good faith, having bought a
                        bound volume with plates 4 and 9 already inserted. <note id="n96"><hi rend="s">18</hi> It is not unlikely that Sotheby’s was
                                given the information about the 1874 sale by Dew-Smith, and that he
                                knew it because he was the one who bought <hi rend="i">America</hi>
                                unbound in 1874 for £18. But the idea that Dew-Smith was the
                                1874 purchaser, i.e., the only owner between 1874 and 1878, cannot
                                be proven.
                            <p>I know nothing about Dew-Smith except that he was “of
                                Cambridge” (<hi rend="i">Bibliography</hi>, 1921), and that
                                he also owned <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy J and Blake’s copy

          <p>In the 1870s, photolithographs could be printed from finegrained limestones
                        and from specially grained zinc plates. To use stone, the negative of the
                        copy to be reproduced is placed in contact with paper coated with a
                        light-sensitive gelatine film. The areas exposed to light become insoluble
                        in water, so that when the sheet is covered with a transfer ink and soaked
                        in a bath of water, all the soluble (unexposed) gelatine lifts off the
                        paper, leaving only the inked image ready to be transferred (counterproofed)
                        onto the prepared stone. To use zinc plates instead of stone, a reverse
                        negative is exposed directly on a sensitized zinc plate, which, because it
                        eliminates the intermediate step of transferring the image, is “much
                        more likely” to retain “the finer qualities” of the
                            original.<ref target="n97" type="note">19</ref> The fine details of
                        plates 4 and 9, including subtle traces of ink along the sides of the text,
                        suggest—as do the platemarks—that these two prints were pulled
                        from zinc plates. Lithography is a planographic method which, at least
                        theoretically, should not leave platemarks. But because a press and a
                        scraper bar are used, printing with too much pressure and with a bar wider
                        than the plate will emboss the shape of the stone or metal plate into the
                        print. The platemarks on plates 4 and 9 reveal the even edges of a metal
                        plate, not the irregular edge of stone. But, as I mentioned, these marks are
                        suspicious. <note id="n97"><hi rend="s">19</hi> Alfred Seymour, <hi rend="i">Practical Lithography</hi> (London: Scott, Greenwood &amp; Son,
                            1903) p. 100. Reverse negatives were first used in the 1870s with
                            collotypes, and are necessary if the print is to be the same direction
                            as the copy reproduced. Like a counterproof transfer, a reverse negative
                            places the image in reverse on the plate so that the print is in the
                            same direction as the original.</note></p>
          <p>Robert N. Essick has in his collection what are possibly the proofs of plates
                        4 and 9. His two impressions were printed on larger sheets (40.3 ×
                        28.5 cm. for plate 4, and 44.5 × 28.5 cm. for plate 9, vs. 36.3
                        × 26.1 cm.), on different paper (“thin, hard, ivory colored,
                        machine made”),<ref target="n98" type="note">20</ref> and in a dull
                        black ink. Neither of his prints has any trace of side platemarks, while the
                        side platemarks are the ones most noticeable in plates 4 and 9 of copy B. In
                        plate 4, the bottom, top, and left platemarks are sharply defined, while the
                        right side is slightly beveled. In plate 9, the plate lines forming the two
                        bottom corners and top right corner intersect; the bottom platemark, for
                        example, is 18.5 cm. long, while the distance between the platemarks is only
                        17.5 cm. In Essick’s plate 9, this bottom platemark is “about
                        20 cm. long.”<ref target="n99" type="note">21</ref> This slight
                        crossing of plate lines in copy B and the fact that the side platemarks are
                        heavier while altogether absent in Essick’s two prints mean that the
                        side platemarks in plates 4 and 9 of copy B are faked. <note id="n98"><hi rend="s">20</hi> Private correspondence.</note><note id="n99"><hi rend="s">21</hi> Private correspondence. In both plates 4
                            and 9 there are tiny ink dots slightly outside the right side
                            platemarks. These ink dots seem to be from the border of the
                            relief-etched plates. If so, they are part of the image the camera
                            photographed and are thus on the litho plate or stone. Essick’s
                            two prints, however, do not show these ink spots.</note></p>
          <p>Such platemarks can be made with a stylus along a metal ruler with a bevel,
                        or along a metal plate. The top and bottom platemarks, however, appear to
                        have been produced by a metal plate in the process of printing, and they are
                        the same distance from the image in Essick’s two prints as they are
                        in copy B. Thus, plates 4 and 9 are either printed from zinc plates, or the
                        same blank metal plates are registered <hi rend="i">exactly</hi> on both
                        sets of impressions.<ref target="n100" type="note">22</ref> Pulling a
                        lithograph face down on a blank metal plate through a rolling press would
                        give platemarks, but such a trick doesn’t explain why side platemarks
                        are absent in Essick’s two prints, or how platemarks can intersect,
                        or why the length of a platemark from the same plate is different in two
                        impressions. Perhaps plates 4 and 9 were printed on a litho press using
                        scraper bars of two different sizes, neither of which was as wide as the
                        plates, and thus not able to force paper over the sides, but which came onto
                        and off the plates with enough pressure to catch the top and bottom edges.
                        The missing side platemarks, therefore, had to be added with a stylus. In
                        any event, because lithographs from zinc and stone would ordinarily have
                        been printed without platemarks, the platemarks, however they were made,
                        were made to deceive, to make a flat image appear slightly embossed like a
                        relief etching. The intention to deceive makes plates 4 and 9 forgeries, not
                        facsimiles. <note id="n100"><hi rend="s">22</hi> It seems that a blank plate
                            or a stylus was used to make platemarks in another illuminated book. The
                            leaves of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> (J),
                            which are inlaid into larger sheets, were either “provided with

                            blank plate” (Keynes and Wolf, <hi rend="i">Census</hi>, p. 59)
                            or “carefully indented at the join of the inner and outer leaves
                            . . . to look like platemarks” (<hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, p.

          <p>For there to be two photomechanically reproduced forgeries, two authentic
                        prints must have been photographed. The bottom four lines of the fake plate
                        4 are missing, so the prototype plate 4 must have been masked. And because
                        photolithographs of the period could reproduce line drawings or designs only
                        in pure black and white (half-tone screens not yet having been perfected<ref target="n101" type="note">23</ref>), the two authentic prints
                        photographed must have been uncolored. In addition to there being requisites
                        for the models, both fake prints also have distinguishing, albeit, more
                        subtle, marks. Plate 4 has an extra line on the lower right side of the leaf
                        underneath the text, ink splatters on the right side of the tree, opposite
                        line 8, and at the end of the last word, “foretold”; plate 9
                        is missing the two birds flying under the lowest tree branch, has an ink
                        trail along the left of the tree trunk, a top branch that is lightly
                        extended to the leaves, and ink splatters along the right side of the plate
                        and along the bottom just under the grass. <note id="n101"><hi rend="s">23</hi> “The half tones of a negative cannot be reproduced
                            by this method, as they can with collotype.” H. T. Wood, <hi rend="i">Modern Methods of Illustrating Books</hi>, 4th ed. (London:
                            Elliot Stock, 1898), pp. 64-65. Wood goes on to say: “For this
                            reason the process is applicable for reproduction; it cannot produce a
                            print from a negative taken direct from nature. What it can do is to
                            reproduce in facsimile any picture or design that has been produced by
                            any printing process whatever (in which tints are not employed), type,
                            engraving, wood-cuts, or lithograph, also any line-drawing in ink,
                            pencil, or chalk, anything in fact which already possesses the grain,
                            line, or stipple required to hold the ink.”</note></p>
          <p>Of the seven monochrome copies with a masked plate 4, <hi rend="i">America</hi> (F), in the British Museum since 1859, comes closest to
                        having these peculiar markings.<ref target="n102" type="note">24</ref> Plate
                        4 (F) has both sets of ink splatters and an ink trace that could have <pb id="p16-222" n="222"/> been transformed into an extra leaf line, and the
                        two birds in plate 9 are very faint. On the other hand, plate 9 (F) has no
                        ink trail, no completion of the top branch, and no ink splatters along the
                        right side of the text. But just as the ink stain at the bottom of plate 9
                        (F), the “JY 59” museum accession number (1859), and the birds
                        could have been rubbed off the plate so that they wouldn’t show in an
                        impression, the light marks completing the branch in plate 9 (B) could have
                        been added, and the ink traces accidently printed from the litho plate
                        itself, possibly the result of it not being thoroughly sponged during
                        inking. Because an image on stone or zinc could be altered in such subtle
                        ways, absolute verification may not be possible, but it does seem probable
                        that plates 4 and 9 of copy F were the prints photographed by or for the
                        forgerer. <note id="n102"><hi rend="s">24</hi> I have checked copies D, E,

          <p>We do not know for sure who is responsible for executing and inserting the
                        two forgeries into <hi rend="i">America</hi> copy B. The person who wrote
                        the inscription and renumbered the plates is not necessarily the person who
                        inserted the two prints. The inscription may be the hand of an honest owner
                        warding off Gilchrist’s implication that his copy with only
                        “18 designs” was incomplete. But, according to my reading of
                        the evidence—and other readings may be possible—we do know
                        when (between 1874 and 1878), how (photolithography), where (London), the
                        probable model (F), and, I believe, why. Plates 4 and 9 are not facsimiles;
                        they are not taken from a lost facsimile edition of <hi rend="i">America</hi> made in the 1870s. In short, they are not like Trianon
                        Press facsimilies doctored up to fool the unsuspecting eye. Plates 4 and 9
                        were executed from the beginning with the intention to pass as originals and
                        thereby secretly complete an otherwise incomplete copy. The plates have done
                        well at both. Many professional bibliographers and bibliophiles have
                        examined this copy of <hi rend="i">America.</hi> To their credit, plates 4
                        and 9 are not only extremely good forgeries, but, and I think this is
                        equally important, as pages in a bound volume, they appear innocent by
                        association. Had plates 4 and 9 been separate prints, it is more likely they
                        would have been detected long ago. As it is, no other illuminated book,
                        bound or loose, is known to contain a facsimile. Do we need to look harder?
                        “Let the collector of prints be cautioned . . . to beware of buying
                        copies for originals. Most of the works of the capital masters have been
                        copied, and many of them so well, that if a person be not versed in prints,
                        he may easily be deceived” (William Gilpin, <hi rend="i">An Essay on

          <p>One of the frustrations and delights of putting on an exhibition is that
                        objects can look different from one’s memory of them when seen
                        together on the walls. It is, of course, part of the raison
                        d’être of such exhibitions that they enable direct comparisons
                        to be made, but they also inevitably make the catalogue, which has to be
                        written many months before the exhibition, out of date, for it cannot
                        include the experience of the exhibition itself. The following notes are
                        intended as corrections to the text and observations arising from the
                        exhibition, and they center largely around the large color prints.</p>
          <p>Martin Butlin’s very recent discovery of an 1804 watermark on the Tate
                        version of the <hi rend="i">Newton</hi> color print (cat. no. 56b) has
                        already demolished the received picture of the chronology and development of
                        the large color prints, some of which are dated 1795. The presence of seven
                        of these prints in the exhibition from various sources offers a useful
                        opportunity to start thinking about them again and I am glad to report some
                        progress. It was clear from seeing the prints together that we have to
                        abandon any sense of a rigid method in their creation; there was no one way
                        of making them and we should see their creation as part of an organic
                        process of trial and error over a number of years. This is brought home by
                        the discovery of Mr. Patrick Noon, Curator of Prints and Drawings at the
                        Yale Center for British Art, that there are definite indications of printing
                        from a relief-etched copper plate on the Metropolitan Museum’s
                        impression of <hi rend="i">God Judging Adam</hi> (cat. no. 51). This has
                        been confirmed by microscopic examination which revealed clear signs of
                        indentation in the printed area and broken fibres around it consistent with
                        pressure from a metal plate. The relief-etched areas, printed in gray, form
                        a kind of broad underdrawing defining the main shapes of the figures, like
                        the relief-etched areas in some of the plates from <hi rend="i">The Book of
                            Urizen</hi> which were color printed. The discovery of relief-etched
                        printing also provides an explanation of the mysterious letters observed on
                        the surface of the New York impression, which appear to be the imprint of
                        part of an embossed address of the kind often found on the back of copper
                        plates; Blake has evidently used the back of a copper plate to make the
                        relief-etched underprinting and not bothered to burnish down the
                        platemaker’s imprint.</p>
          <p>This strongly suggests that <hi rend="i">God Judging Adam</hi> was the first
                        of the large color prints to be worked on and that at first Blake simply
                        extended the method he had employed for color printing the illuminated books
                        by using a very much larger copper plate. We may surmise that he would have
                        found relief etching on this size of plate to be time consuming and
                        difficult and therefore not worth the labor: certainly none of the other
                        color prints shows any signs of such relief etching but only the direct
                        application of color from an unetched surface. There is every likelihood
                        that he began working on these problems in 1795 when he was probably
                        finishing the last of the color-printed illuminated books; on the other hand
                        the watermark on the Tate <hi rend="i">Newton</hi> proves that he was
                        working with a color-printing method as late as 1804, when he was preparing
                        a set of the prints for Thomas Butts. The little known Glen Foerd version of
                        the <hi rend="i">Newton</hi> is also in the exhibition (cat. no. 56), and it
                        is clear that the two versions are quite different in handling, and that
                        there are arguments for seeing the Glen Foerd version as predating the Tate
                        version by several years. The differences between the two figures of
                        Newton—the angle of the head, the contour of the back, the
                        relationship of the feet to each other and the angle of the
                        hands—make it unlikely that they were printed from the same surface:
                        it is probable that Blake made a fresh start with the Tate version,
                        presumably to complete the set for Thomas Butts. The differences are
                        compatible with a space of many years between the two versions, and perhaps
                        with the change of style in Blake’s art in the years around 1800.</p>
          <p>These changes certainly involve a stronger linearity which can be seen in the
                        Tate version in the more incisive contour, and the reduction of broken lines
                        of varied thickness, but the most striking differences are in the modeling.
                        The forms in the Glen Foerd version are built up with a simple plasticity,
                        shadowing from the lower contour leaving the main area without interior
                        modeling. The Tate version, on the other hand, has a high degree of
                        definition within the larger forms so that it is possible to discern the
                        segmentation of the muscles and sense the shape of bone and cartilage
                        beneath. This is achieved in the figure of Newton by a stippling technique
                        applied almost exclusively in watercolor, and it is possible to see here an
                        analogy with the 1803 watercolor in the exhibition of <hi rend="i">St. Paul
                            preaching</hi> (cat. no. 75). This technique may derive from
                        Blake’s experience as a miniature painter, as Raymond Lister has
                        suggested. The background in the Glen Foerd version is defined by dark
                        washes but in the Tate version it is filled with an intense blue color; in
                        fact color pervades all the darker areas of the later print and the modeling
                        of the figure also picks up the blue from the background. <pb id="p16-225" n="225"/> The curious aqueous anemone-like effect in the vegetation of
                        the Tate version is not present in the Glen Foerd version where Newton is
                        clearly in a cave through which light passes from the top left.</p>
          <p>There are also clear differences in the way the color printing is applied; in
                        the Glen Foerd <hi rend="i">Newton</hi> it has a thick and pasty quality,
                        applied in broad dabs with occasional areas of aqueous reticulation as if
                        the pressure was applied fairly gently from the printing surface. In the
                        Tate Gallery version the color printing seems more controlled and
                        concentrated in specific areas like the rocky background. The lack of the
                        fluid kind of reticulation led me at first to wonder if it was color printed
                        at all and built up instead with a dabber in the thicker areas, but this
                        does not seem likely on further examination. The thickness and density of
                        the Glen Foerd color printing aligns it with the Whitney <hi rend="i">Good
                            and Evil Angels</hi> (cat. no. 53) and I would propose that these two
                        and the Metropolitan <hi rend="i">God Judging Adam</hi> can be dated to
                        about 1795. The <hi rend="i">Pity</hi> (cat. no. 52) and the <hi rend="i">Hecate</hi> (cat. no. 55) from the Tate, however, present more
                        difficult problems. There can be no doubt from a comparison with the Tate
                            <hi rend="i">Newton</hi> that they were at least finished off in 1804-05
                        for sale to Thomas Butts, but the quality of the color printing underneath,
                        as far as it can be discerned under the final stippled coloring, seems to
                        have the density of the presumed 1795 prints. It is still arguable, then,
                        that these were, as was always thought, printed in 1795 and then finished
                        finally in 1804-05 for Butts. If this is right then it would suggest that
                        when Butts commissioned a set of the prints Blake had a mixed group of
                        impressions of the color prints lying about the studio, most of which could
                        be adapted into a harmonious set while others, including the <hi rend="i">Newton</hi> for reasons unknown, had to be made anew. This is probably
                        as far as we can go at the moment but we will be able to fill out the
                        account when the other Tate color prints are examined more closely.</p>
          <p>Herewith a few notes on other things in the show:</p>
          <p>Cat. no. 2. <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea</hi> engraving (Trinity College,
                        Hartford, Ct.). This appears to be a more interesting object than I first
                        thought. Apart from touches of wash it has small areas of scraping out, and
                        most unexpected, what appears to be the expressive use of plate tone on the
                        surface to give a greater richness of texture. If this is deliberate then it
                        suggests the use of yet another printing technique by Blake, and one that
                        was hardly ever used in his time. The use of scraping out suggests a date in
                        the 1820s; it is also used in the Mellon copy of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, pl. 99.</p>
          <p>44. <hi rend="i">Europe a Prophecy</hi>, copy A. I had hinted in the
                        catalogue that there might be something wrong with the coloring of this
                        copy, and I am now fully persuaded that most of the color washes, apart from
                        the color printing, have been added by a later hand, perhaps in this
                        century.</p>
          <p>70. <hi rend="i">The Virgin Hushing the Young John the Baptist.</hi> Though a
                        laboratory report states that this work is on paper it looks as if it is on
                        canvas; certainly the weave is very strongly visible. Perhaps it is on very
                        thin paper applied wet to the canvas?</p>
          <p>79. <hi rend="i">The Repose of the Holy Family in Egypt.</hi> Though magical
                        in quality and drawing this watercolor can be seen to be very badly
                        faded.</p>

          <p>The exhibition <hi rend="i">William Blake: His Art and Times</hi> was
                        organized by David Bindman and jointly sponsored by the Yale Center for
                        British Art in New Haven (where it was very handsomely installed from 15
                        September to 14 November 1982—the showing on which this review is
                        based) and the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto (3 December 1982—6
                        February 1983). The exhibition was a rather daring undertaking given the
                        enormous amount of attention already paid to Blake in recent years. For
                        example, G.E. Bentley, Jr.’s <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> was
                        published in 1977; and since 1978, the year of Martin Butlin’s
                        monumental <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi> exhibition at the Tate Gallery,
                        accompanied by an excellent and informative catalogue, several other
                        important monographs have been published: among them are Butlin’s
                        catalogue raisonné. <hi rend="i">The Paintings and Drawings of
                            William Blake</hi>, Robert Essick’s <hi rend="i">William Blake
                            Printmaker</hi>, and Bindman’s own <hi rend="i">The Complete
                            Graphic Works of William Blake</hi> together with his <hi rend="i">Blake
                            as an Artist.</hi> Of course there had not been a large scale exhibition
                        of Blake’s art in this country since the one in 1939 at the
                        Philadelphia Museum of Art, and that show had been selected entirely from
                        collections in the United States. One can understand, therefore, the
                        pressures for a grand display on this side of the Atlantic, all the more so
                        because conservation problems are making Blake collectors wary of lending
                        important objects to the repetitious minor exhibitions that have been
                        organized in great numbers in recent years, and also of showing them at home
                        to anyone other than serious scholars.</p>
          <p>The germ of the New Haven/Toronto show came in conversations between Bindman
                        and Katharine A. Lochnan, Curator of Prints and Drawings at the Art Gallery
                        of Ontario, some years ago. The initial intent was similar to that of the
                        1939 Philadelphia exhibition: to show Blake in North American collections, a
                        much richer body of material than one could find in 1939, thanks principally
                        to the extraordinary acquisitions of Paul Mellon. Thus the Yale Center for
                        British Art, which houses much of the Mellon Collection, was viewed as a
                        most appropriate cosponsor; and, in fact, well over a third of the show was
                        drawn from various Yale institutions (the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript
                        Library, the Yale University Art Gallery, the Lewis Walpole Library at
                        Farmington, as well as the Paul Mellon and other collections at the Center
                        for British Art). Numerous loans also came from Mr. and Mrs. Mellon’s
                        private collection; the Pierpont Morgan Library; the Museum of Fine Arts,
                        Boston; the Library of Congress, Rosenwald Collection; the National Gallery
                        of Art, Rosenwald Collection; and Robert N. Essick. Despite the richness of
                        American collections, however, certain key pieces were necessarily borrowed
                        from abroad—specifically from the Tate Gallery, the British Museum,
                        and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and the Fitzwilliam Museum in
                        Cambridge.</p>
          <p>Major Blake exhibitions must now be compared to the Tate show of 1978; and in
                        this case, the comparison seems apt in terms of differences in kind. The
                        earlier show was very large, comprising 339 pieces, all of them by or after
                        Blake except for a drawing by his brother Robert that was the source of
                        William’s relief etching, <hi rend="i">The Approach of Doom.</hi> The
                        exhibition emphasized and explored very specifically Blake’s greatest
                        accomplishments as a visual artist, in part by virtually ignoring such
                        aspects of his work as the reproductive engravings that were the
                        artist’s main source of income. In that exhibition, Martin Butlin
                        convincingly demonstrated that Blake “had an intensity of vision, an
                        imaginative scope, and a multiplicity of means of expression . . . beyond
                        most men.”<ref target="n103" type="note">1</ref> In contrast, the New
                        Haven / Toronto show was considerably smaller, comprising some 200 pieces
                        described in 125 catalogue entries (e.g., cat. no. 115 covers sixteen
                        watercolors and engravings for <hi rend="i">Illustrations to the Book of
                            Job</hi>, cat. no. 116 covers thirteen for <hi rend="i">Illustrations
                            for Dante</hi>, and so forth). <note id="n103"><hi rend="s">1</hi>

          <p>Accepting the notion that Blake’s greatness as a visual artist had
                        been demonstrated by the Tate exhibition, <pb id="p16-227" n="227"/> Bindman
                        set out to explore the intellectual and artistic milieu that helped give
                        this greatness its form. While fewer of the major paintings were here than
                        in the London show, this one was, in fact, more comprehensive, including
                        aspects of Blake’s art not considered in 1978 and showing documentary
                        material as well. In addition, Blake’s own works of art were
                        interspersed with a number of pieces by his contemporaries; and the
                        inclusion of books of historical and philosophical interest to him and
                        others of the period placed his oeuvre in a broad intellectual context.</p>
          <p>Bindman carefully balanced and integrated this material so the focus on Blake
                        was in no way diminished. First, the sections devoted to the art of
                        Blake’s time (“The Elevated Style in the 1780s”;
                        “The Revolutionary Background: Blake’s Circles in the
                        1790s”; “<hi rend="i">Jerusalem:</hi> the Antiquarian
                        Background”; and “The Linnell Circle”) were far fewer
                        than those devoted to Blake’s own art; and the main purpose of them
                        was clearly to provide a background for a better understanding of Blake,
                        although the didactic aspects of the exhibition never overshadowed the
                        aesthetic. Much of the ancillary material was quite small, or in the form of
                        books, and was shown in cases, for the most part leaving the walls to
                        feature Blake. The main exception was the section of drawings and prints
                        representing the scope of narrative subjects (“The Elevated
                        Style”) prevalent in English art of the 1780s, and in which pieces by
                        or after John Flaxman, Richard Cosway, John Mortimer, Benjamin West, George
                        Romney and Henry Fuseli were hung. In them one found allusions to the art of
                        classical antiquity and the High Renaissance of the sort one sees throughout
                        Blake’s own oeuvre.</p>
          <p>The basic arrangement of the Blake material was chronological: “The
                        Engraver’s Apprentice, 1772-79”; “Radical History
                        Painter: the 1780s”; “Making a Living: Reproductive
                        Engraving”; “Relief Etching and Experimental Printing,
                        1788-96”; “Illuminated Books and Prophecies, 1788-95”;
                        “Separate Colour Prints, c. 1794-1805”; “After the
                        Prophecies: Illustrated Books”; “An Understanding Patron:
                        Thomas Butts and Paintings from the Bible, 1799-c. 1809” (a conscious
                        contrast, perhaps, to the section in the Tate show called “The
                        Hazards of Patronage: William Hayley and ‘The Grave,’ c.
                        1799-1806”); “Blake in Felpham, 1800-1803”;
                        “Milton: Prophecy and Illustrations, 1801-c. 1820”;
                        “Blake’s Exhibition of 1809: The <figure><head>1. The Witch of En-dor, by Sharp after West, cat. 22.</head><figDesc>Yale Center for British Art, Paul Mellon Collection.</figDesc></figure><figure><head>2. The Good and Evil Angels Struggling for Possession of a Child,

                        c. 1818-27.”</p>
          <p>One realized that, given the very large body of work that Blake produced,
                        each piece on display was purposefully selected to function in a number of
                        ways. Some pieces allowed for iconographical comparisons both within
                        Blake’s own oeuvre and in relation to the work of other artists. Some
                        made stylistic and technical points. Some had historical or philosophical
                        import. Various threads were woven throughout the fabric of the exhibition,
                        and the viewer was able to perceive again and again relationships between
                        the sections and to sense the totality in a body of work through selected
                        pieces. To mention only a few instances, <hi rend="i">The Witch of Endor
                            Raising the Spirit of Samuel</hi> is seen in a 1783 version by Blake
                        (cat. 11), in a later version by him, c. 1800-1805 (cat. 77), and in an
                        engraving by William Sharp after Benjamin West (cat. 22, illus. 1), thus
                        allowing Blake’s own evolution to be studied while also comparing his
                        representation of the subject with that of another artist. <hi rend="i">Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing</hi> (cat. 16) introduces
                        the theme of fairies which is often picked up in Blake’s later work
                        (e.g., as Bindman points out, in the title page for <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, cat. 99b). From Blake’s scores of reproductive
                        engravings, Bindman selected works after earlier masters (Watteau, cat. 25),
                        as well as works after Blake’s contemporaries (e.g., Fuseli, cat.
                        27).</p>
          <p>Points about method, too, were well managed. The technical range of
                        Blake’s reproductive prints was evident—from the stipple
                        engraving that the artist presumably despised (e.g., <hi rend="i">Zephyrus
                            and Flora</hi>, after Stothard, cat. 26), through the dot and lozenge
                        engraving technique at its most spectacular in the exceedingly dramatic <hi rend="i">Head of a Damned Soul</hi> after Fuseli (cat. 28). In the
                        “Relief Etching and Experimental Printing” section, the single
                        surviving fragment of an etching plate used by Blake for relief printing (a
                        cancelled plate from <hi rend="i">America</hi>) was shown with a proof
                        impression from it (cat. 34, 35), and other trial proofs of various sorts
                        helped the viewer to see and understand Blake’s processes.
                        Particularly interesting was a proof of the title page of <hi rend="i">The
                            [First] Book of Urizen</hi> with areas of monotype-like color printing,
                        but lacking final watercolor refinements (cat. 37). This section showed
                        initial working phases of Blake’s processes, the final results of
                        which were demonstrated in all of their rich variety later in the
                        exhibition. In contrast, a copy of Joseph Ritson’s <hi rend="i">Select Collection of English Songs</hi> with conventionally engraved
                        illustrations by Blake and others after Stothard (cat. 32) vividly
                        demonstrated the differences between traditional book illustration and
                        Blake’s personal inventions and methods.</p>
          <p>Among the most rewarding sections of the show, one which explored the
                        development of Blake’s conceptual (spiritual) and technical
                        sophistication, was “Illuminated Books and Prophecies.” On
                        view were <hi rend="i">There is no Natural Religion</hi> including the
                        unique “Application” plate (cat. 38b) given by Sir Geoffrey
                        Keynes to the Pierpont Morgan Library (important not only because it is
                        unique, but also because it is an early example of the figure which later is
                        seen as <hi rend="i">Newton</hi>, cat. 56); <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel;
                            The Marriage of Heaven and Hell; Visions of the Daughters of
                            Albion;</hi> and several separately mounted pages from the very
                        beautiful colored copy of <hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi> in the Mellon
                        private collection, unusual in that it is richly colored, whereas most
                        surviving copies are uncolored. Three copies (F, P, U) of a single page from
                            <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> (cat. 39) colored at different
                        periods of Blake’s career showed his evolution in unifying on the
                        page the image and text relationships. In the earliest (copy F, which
                        Bindman cites as a copy of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> to which has
                        been added an incomplete copy of <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi>) the
                        delicate washes tend to heighten only the image, while in the latest (copy
                        U, colored 1815 or later), the color is rich, vibrant, and heightened with
                        gold, fully illuminating both image and text. Quite another matter, and
                        equally marvelous to see, the display of five of the seven known copies of
                            <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (cat. 45), including the only one colored in
                        watercolor rather than color printed, showed the great variety in
                        Blake’s handcoloring of one title during a rather concentrated period
                        of time (probably 1795-96 for the color printed versions with the
                        watercolored copy probably dating from the early 1820s).</p>
          <p>In the section “Separate Colour Prints, c. 1794-1805,” examples
                        from the <hi rend="i">Small</hi> and <hi rend="i">Large Book of Designs</hi>
                        were represented as well as six images (in seven impressions) of
                        Blake’s series of twelve elaborate monoprints (color printed
                        drawings, as they are more generally known): <hi rend="i">God Judging Adam,
                            Pity, The Good and Evil Angels Struggling for Possession of a Child</hi>
                        (illus. 2); <hi rend="i">Christ Appearing to the Apostles after the
                            Resurrection, Hecate</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Newton</hi> (cat. 51-56).
                        Until recently, all impressions of the twelve subjects, each known in from
                        one to three impressions reworked with paint to a varying extent and every
                        one unique, were thought to date from c. 1795. When the Tate Gallery <hi rend="i">Newton</hi> was removed from its mount in preparation for this
                        exhibition, however, it was found to be on paper with an 1804 watermark.
                        This piece was hung side by side with the one other know version of the
                        subject, a far less familiar one, in the collection of the Lutheran Church
                        in America, Glen Foerd at Torresdale (illus. 3). These two <hi rend="i">Newton</hi> prints present quite a challenge: to the 1804 watermark on
                        the Tate sheet must be added the fact that its surface is exceedingly rich
                        and painterly, making it look quite different from the Lutheran Church
                        version (see David Bindman’s “Afterword” elsewhere in
                        this issue). The painterly surface caused speculation that the Tate version
                        was entirely a painted rather than a reworked color print of the subject.
                        The present writer, like Bindman, is not at all convinced that this is
                        so.</p>
          <p>Another discovery as important as the 1804 watermark <pb id="p16-229" n="229"/><figure><head>4. Christ Giving Sight to Bartimaeus, cat. 72.</head><figDesc>Yale Center for British Art, Paul Mellon Collection.</figDesc></figure> was made by Patrick Noon, Curator of Prints and Drawings at the
                        Center for British Art, who observed that the printed base of the
                        Metropolitan’s <hi rend="i">God Judging Adam</hi> was printed from
                        the relief surface of a copper plate into which the image had been
                        etched—quite similar in fact to the plates of the illuminated books
                        (again, see Bindman’s “Afterword” for further
                        discussion).</p>
          <p>Blake’s expressive range in his illustrations for Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>,
                        and Gray’s <hi rend="i">Poems</hi> was displayed in the selection of
                        watercolor designs for them. In the section “After the Prophecies:
                        Illustrated Books,” one also found a rejected design and the unique
                        proof of Blake’s own white line etching (printed relief) for the
                        “Death’s Door” plate (cat. 64a,b) in <hi rend="i">The
                            Grave.</hi></p>
          <p>Although conservation considerations prevented the loan of many of the
                        tempera paintings that Blake executed under the patronage of Thomas Butts,
                        there were five to be seen. Among them were <hi rend="i">Christ Giving Sight
                            to Bartimaeus</hi> (cat. 72, illus. 4) and, in a splendid state of
                        preservation, <hi rend="i">The Virgin Hushing the Young John the
                            Baptist</hi> (cat. 70) from a private collection in Chicago; it is
                        always rewarding to see little known works not in the public domain included
                        in exhibitions. In addition to the temperas, the Butts section included a
                        number of watercolors, the most important, perhaps, being those for
                        Revelation, (cat. 80-83) a theme which, as connected with millinarianism,
                        was important to the context that Bindman emphasized in his catalogue (see
                        below).</p>
          <p>Hayley’s patronage was less successful than Butts’ and the
                        section of the exhibition devoted to the Felpham period <figure><head>5. The Last Judgment, cat. 98.</head><figDesc>National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., Rosenwald
                                Collection.</figDesc></figure><figure><head>6. Portrait of John Linnell, cat. 117.</head><figDesc>National Gallery of Art, Rosenwald Collection.</figDesc></figure><pb id="p16-230" n="230"/> relied heavily on documentary material: a letter
                        of 1800 to John Flaxman beside one of two and a half years later to James
                        Blake showed Blake’s delight at being in the country turn to great
                        dismay. The star of this section of the show, however, was the very tiny (4
                        3/16 × 2 ½ inch) tempera on copper, <hi rend="i">The
                            Horse</hi> (cat. 89), related to the illustration in Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads.</hi> From Mr. and Mrs. Mellon’s private
                        collection, dating from 1805-06 or possibly from as late as the 1820s, the
                        piece is a jewel.</p>
          <p>During his Felpham sojourn while Blake was helping Hayley with
                        Cowper’s edition of Milton, he became preoccupied with the great
                        poet, and the results of this preoccupation were seen in the section
                        “Milton: Prophecy and Illustrations, 1805-c.1820.” The
                        earliest Milton illustrations, the 1801 <hi rend="i">Comus</hi> watercolors
                        in the Huntington Library, were not available for loan, the same being true
                        for the first (1807) set of <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> illustrations.
                        However, selections from the 1808 <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> were on
                        show (as well as an example of the third [1822] set, seen in the section
                        devoted to Blake’s last decade), as were selections from the 1815-20
                            <hi rend="i">Comus</hi> illustrations and from those to <hi rend="i">L’Allegro</hi> and <hi rend="i">Il Penseroso</hi> of the same
                        period. The concentrated energy in these small images of the late teens as
                        well as their rich coloration foretell the somewhat larger and equally
                        magnificent Dante series that comes at the end of Blake’s life.
                        Complementing the Milton watercolors, the single complete copy of <hi rend="i">Milton a Poem</hi> (cat. 90), with fifty plates (copy D) was on
                        show. As Bindman pointed out in his catalogue, this most elaborate of the
                        extant copies of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> handsomely complemented the only
                        known colored copy of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, also on view (cat.
                        99).</p>
          <p>The section devoted to Blake’s unsuccessful 1809 exhibition included
                        its catalogue which sets forth the artist’s most distinguished
                        writing on his own art. Here, too, most of the relevant surviving temperas
                        (“frescos”) were too fragile to travel, and were represented
                        by related material: e.g., a pencil study, <hi rend="i">The Bard</hi> (cat.
                        96) of 1809, <hi rend="i">The Canterbury Pilgrims</hi> engraving,
                        accompanied by the original copper plate from which it was printed and the
                        1809 prospectus for the piece (cat. 97). The star in this section was the
                        National Gallery’s <hi rend="i">Last Judgment</hi> (cat. 98, illus.
                        5) drawing. One technical disagreement here: I suspect this sheet probably
                        was not done with pen and ink at all, but, rather, with a very fine brush
                        and watercolor. I suspect this may also be true for many pieces that are
                        recorded in Bindman’s catalogue and elsewhere as having been reworked
                        with pen and ink.</p>
          <p>Sixteen plates of the one hundred in the exquisite and only colored copy of
                            <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> in the Mellon Collection were on view,
                        including the title page and all four full-page frontispieces. <hi rend="i">A Description of Jerusalem</hi> by Richard Brothers (cat. no. 101) in
                        the section “<hi rend="i">Jerusalem:</hi> The Antiquarian
                        Background” reinforced the belief that the return to Jerusalem was
                        central to millinarianism (as was the idea of apocalypse noted earlier).
                        Other books dealing with the history (mythological and otherwise) of the
                        British Isles were included here as well.</p>
          <p>A diverse group of pieces represented Blake’s last decade, among them,
                        his only wood engravings, the illustrations for Thornton’s <hi rend="i">Virgil</hi> (cat. 106), the Pierpont Morgan Library’s
                        marvelous pencil study for Blake’s enigmatic <hi rend="i">Arlington
                            Court Picture</hi> (cat. 108), one of two known impressions of the <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> engraving (cat. 110), the late
                        relief-etched treatises <hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi>, and <hi rend="i">On Homer’s Poetry and On Virgil</hi> (cat. 111, 112).
                        The major emphasis of this section, however, as would be expected, was on
                        the Job and Dante illustrations. The Job display (cat. 115) included six of
                        the early (1805-10) watercolors done for Thomas Butts, now in the Morgan
                        Library, and ten of the series of twenty-one engravings, including all six
                        derived from the watercolors on show. This allowed for comparison of the
                        early and later versions (in different techniques) as well as offering a
                        broad representation of the images. Blake’s agreement with Linnell,
                        Linnell’s account book of the Job project, and a related receipt were
                        included in the final, “Linnell Circle,” section of the show.
                        In the watercolors for Job one sees how specific Blake could be in working
                        studies that later were transformed into another medium, while, in contrast,
                        the Dante watercolors show how freely-handled ideas might take form.</p>
          <p>The Dante series (cat. 116) was represented by five watercolors to the
                        “Inferno” (plus four of the seven engravings, all of them for
                        the “Inferno”), three watercolors to
                        “Purgatorio” and, in a sense ending the exhibition, the
                        “St. Peter, St. James, Dante, and Beatrice with St. John
                        also,” for “Paradisio.” In one instance, “The
                        Pit of Disease: The Falsifiers,” the watercolor (one of the more
                        highly finished ones in the series) was shown with the engraving; and the
                        selection of watercolors generally showed the diversity of finish in the
                        set, from subjects that are very loosely worked (e.g., “The Angel
                        Boat”), to highly finished ones like the “Paradiso”
                        scene noted above. For the record, Blake’s seven copper plates for
                        the Dante series are not now in the Library of Congress, Rosenwald
                        Collection, as indicated by Bindman, but in the National Gallery of Art,
                        Rosenwald Collection.</p>
          <p>“The Linnell Circle” section included Blake’s 1825
                        pencil drawing, <hi rend="i">Portrait of John Linnell</hi> (cat. 117, illus.
                        6), two works by Linnell, and an engraved portrait of the engraver Wilson
                        Lowry, worked jointly by Linnell and Blake (cat. 119). Included, too, were
                        works by George Richmond and Samuel Palmer as well as <hi rend="i">George
                            Cumberland’s Calling Card</hi> (cat. 125), “the last thing
                        Blake attempted to engrave,” according to Bindman, quoting Mrs.
                        Blake.</p>
          <p>Exhibitions such as this confirm beyond any doubt the importance of the
                        exhibition form as a carrier of knowledge quite distinct from fully
                        illustrated volumes about the work of an artist. The enormous, if subtle,
                        differences between the two <hi rend="i">Newtons</hi> are observable only
                            <pb id="p16-231" n="231"/> with the two works physically side by side.
                        Only in this circumstance can one observe similarities, especially in
                        tactile aspects, between the Tate version of <hi rend="i">Newton</hi> and
                        other color printed subjects, similarities that demonstrate (once the
                        question arises) that the <hi rend="i">Newton</hi> does have a printed
                        base—albeit one that probably was made later than previously had been
                        thought (one recalls that similar questions and observations arose from
                        viewing three impressions of <hi rend="i">The Ancient of Days</hi> in the
                        Tate exhibition). Only when seen side by side with the other color prints
                        can the clearly defined greyish outline in <hi rend="i">God Judging
                            Adam</hi> stand out as having been printed in relief from an etched
                        plate. And only in an exhibition of this kind in which Blake is placed next
                        to his contemporaries can one see his extraordinary distinctiveness. For
                        example, Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engraving (cat. 15)
                        practically jumps off the wall as it demonstrates the artist’s
                        exquisite understanding of the expressive potential of the burin, all the
                        more so when it is placed just several feet from a piece by one of the most
                        admired craftsmen of the period, William Sharp. Sharp’s <hi rend="i">Witch of En-dor</hi> after Benjamin West, mentioned earlier, is
                        strikingly dull in its repetitious description of form. If one does nothing
                        more than study the edges of the folds of clothing in Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> in contrast to similar forms in Sharp’s piece,
                        it is possible to glimpse the power of Blake’s imaginatively complex
                        world. Although Blake used precisely the same engraver’s vocabulary
                        in general use at the time, parallel strokes, cross hatching, dot and
                        lozenge, etc., each of his marks is made with a passion that appears to be
                        without bounds.</p>
          <p>Throughout his catalogue, Bindman captures the spirit of Blake, summarizing
                        that “Blake . . . intends us always to go further and find that our
                        certainties have evaporated.”<ref target="n104" type="note">2</ref>
                        He points out how Blake made use of many of the artistic conventions of his
                        time while rejecting others. Touching upon the ideas that were in the air,
                        so to speak, in Blake’s London, Bindman doesn’t try to project
                        a cause and effect relationship. The same is so when he mentions possible
                        influences on Blake, of, for example, children’s books and satirical
                        political cartoons. He discusses Blake’s relationships with and
                        differences from his artist colleagues while touching as well upon aesthetic
                        affinities that are less clearly pinned down (e.g., Bindman makes cogent
                        comparisons of Blake with Goya while pointing out that it is unlikely that
                        the two artists actually knew each other’s work). Blake’s
                        ambivalence toward confining systems is observable throughout his career.
                        For example, while his relief-etching inventions allowed him to bypass
                        commercial publishers, he continued to try to find both publishers and
                        patrons. As Bindman points out, given Blake’s revolutionary stance
                        his obscurity was undoubtedly his protection. Despite this obscurity Bindman
                        offers us remarkably succinct summary accounts of Blake’s themes,
                        always maintaining a sense of the complexity that is essential to a true
                        study of Blake in depth, but allowing the reader to move intelligently
                        through the exhibition knowing the abbreviated catalogue information alone.
                            <note id="n104"><hi rend="s">2</hi> David Bindman, <hi rend="i">William
                                Blake: His Art and Times</hi> (ex. cat.), (New Haven and Toronto,
                            1982), p. 44.</note></p>
          <p>One of Bindman’s major theses is that Blake’s visionary stance
                        had many parallels with the prevailing dissenting philosophical thought of
                        his time, specifically the millenarianism of Richard Brothers and Joanna
                        Southcott. A central unifying issue was the prophecy of an apocalyptic,
                        revolutionary, and vengeful destruction of the fallen, corrupt,
                        materialistic world, and the beliefs that true redemption was to be found
                        through Christ and that the meaning of the Bible was available in every age,
                        but only to a few privileged individuals who were guided by an inner light.
                        For Blake, this inner light obviously was the force behind his art which he
                        valued as a form of prayer.</p>
          <p>Blake is a difficult artist. This exhibition places him in context; yet, in
                        context, he remains apart. The exhibition rather reinforces one’s
                        awareness of Blake’s own peculiar grasp of the neoclassical and the
                        horrific (the serene juxtaposed with the bizarre), his placement of almost
                        naive formal generalization next to imaginative particularization. One sees
                        obviously exquisite skill displayed next to offhanded clumsiness; one sees
                        extraordinarily subtle color relationships in contrast to rather obvious use
                        of the primaries. One feels delight and pride and sadness and shame at being
                        part of the human experience.</p>
          <p>At home, later, one can review the catalogue, rethink Bindman’s ideas
                        on Blake’s influences and relationships, can further ponder the
                        narrative aspects of the meaning of images that are graspable from catalogue
                        reproductions, essentially in black and white (although this catalogue does
                        include twenty-one color plates), in which objects of various sizes fit into
                        the scale of a page or a column. One can only try to recall what was
                        understood about the world in a new way having had the privilege of peering
                        from the distance of a few inches at the tiny forms in the Morgan Library
                        watercolors for <hi rend="i">L’Allegro</hi> and <hi rend="i">Il
                            Penseroso</hi> (delicate, brightly colored, and sprightly drawn) having
                        just been knocked-out from across the room by the powerful, somber, dense,
                        dark, watercolor illustrations to the Book of Revelation which were brought
                        together from Brooklyn, New York City, Washington, and Philadelphia for a
                        rare comparative viewing in New Haven and then Toronto.</p>
          <p>Such experiences give one a feeling of elation, and this elation is
                        heightened by awe at the range of this particular human mind. In discussing
                        another intelligence, that of Frederich Hölderlin, Richard Unger made
                        some observations about Blake in a literary context, but they seem equally
                        apt here: “Like Blake, Hölderlin was not adequately valued or
                        even partially understood until the twentieth century. And he has likewise
                        remained permanently esoteric and ‘difficult’ for us; critics
                        are still grappling with the literal meaning of his major poems. But, also,
                        as in the case of Blake, it is perhaps the very quality of this difficulty
                        which often intrigues us. For these <pb id="p16-232" n="232"/> poets
                        sometimes appear to understand more than we do; they admittedly share our
                        problems but we suspect they have seen these problems more clearly and in
                        greater depth. And in our interpretations it may seem that (rather than
                        explaining their ‘relevance’) we are attempting to discover
                        something which, in the silence of their texts, they already
                            know”<ref target="n105" type="note">3</ref><note id="n105"><hi rend="s">3</hi><hi rend="i"> Hölderlin’s Major Poetry: The Dialectics of

          <p>Several assumptions and these make up a credo for this work. “A book
                        is made by its public, the readers it literally finds and the people in the
                        author’s mind’s eye” (p. 9). The democratization of
                        patronage in 1760-1830 consequently affected all the arts. The writers of
                        the period responded as rebels or reactionaries. Dissent provided
                        “the classic stock of the English left,” hence Priestley,
                        Paine, Godwin, Hazlitt, and Blake, and hence the defections of Wordsworth,
                        Coleridge, and Southey. Conditions and moods changed rapidly, so that
                        literary periods of such short duration as 1790-98, 1800-15, 1817-20, and
                        1820-23 can be identified in critical reviews, fiction, and poetry.</p>
          <p>Marilyn Butler has shown her superior knowledge and control of documentary
                        and intellectual history in books on the novelists Edgeworth, Austen, and
                        Peacock. Her inclusion now of poets and essayists accompanies a greatly
                        increased factor of speculation. Instead of specific citation, she gives for
                        each chapter “suggestions for further reading.” (In keeping
                        with this appeal to the younger student, the publisher has reduced the
                        typeface sufficiently to exclude the aged scholar.) Reliance upon
                        unidentified secondary sources makes it difficult to tell when error is
                        typographical, but insistence upon rapid fluctuations in response to public
                        mood makes significant a misdating of Coleridge’s <hi rend="i">Watchman</hi> and an implication that Keats could have seen a book by
                        Coleridge entitled <hi rend="i">Lay Sermons.</hi> Organization and method
                        resemble those of Frederick E. Pierce, <hi rend="i">Currents and Eddies in
                            the English Romantic Generation</hi> (Yale, 1918), although Butler
                        subordinates minor authors in a fashion deemed unscholarly in
                        Pierce’s day. She refutes an error then current that Romanticism
                        rebelled against an Augustan eighteenth century. Readings in art history and
                        attention to system lead her to say instead that a “revival of
                        Neoclassicism began with Byron’s <hi rend="i">Childe
                        Harold</hi>” (p. 181).</p>
          <p>The bipolar formulas of the book do not impede novel interpretations and in
                        general encourage them: Wordsworth’s Preface of 1800 advances
                        Neoclassical precepts in a Neoclassical way (p. 60). Wordsworth was
                        counter-revolutionary in 1796 (pp. 64-65); later, slower than Coleridge, he
                        recognized that a counter-revolutionary stance could bring popularity (p.
                        68). Of Blake’s works of 1790-94 “the corporate author”
                        (in accord with the axiom quoted at the beginning of this review) “is
                        the urban subclass which emerged through its opposition to Britain’s
                        national policy” (p. 43). Blake’s roots are “in the
                        artisan world, Protestant, radical, Bible-reading, to which the
                        Swedenborgians appealed before they organized themselves” (pp.
                        48-49); he “conveys no feeling for the English plot of ground”
                        (p. 44). English Blake, made an internationalist by Fuseli, ranges to
                        America, Europe, Africa, Uranus, Creation, and the Last Trump, all in
                        keeping with the public consciousness of changing political events. Shelley
                        wrote for an elite (p. 114, contrast p. 146). Reviving the old argument that
                            <hi rend="i">Alastor</hi> attacks Wordsworth, Butler adds that the
                        “fanatics” at the opening of <hi rend="i">The Fall of
                            Hyperion</hi> are <pb id="p16-233" n="233"/> Wordsworth and other
                        Christian apologists (p. 152) and that <hi rend="i">Mont Blanc</hi> and <hi rend="i">Frankenstein</hi> likewise reject Wordsworth’s
                        solitaries. Chapter 5, “The Cult of the South,” argues that
                            <hi rend="i">Lamia, Don Juan</hi>, and various works by Shelley and
                        Peacock carry out the anti-Christian sexuality of Erasmus Darwin and Richard
                        Payne Knight. There is a stimulating paragraph on <hi rend="i">The Witch of
                            Atlas</hi>; like almost all the assertions concerning individual works,
                        it would be strengthened by development and demonstration.</p>
          <p>The method, then, is to show how brief segments within 1760-1830 can be
                        characterized by changed relations between and within literary works of
                        rebellion or reaction. Alert application of the method brings the
                        observation that “the Napoleonic Wars may have cost more lives in
                        proportion to the British population than the 1914-18 war,” and that
                        the “failure of literature to reflect the holocaust”
                        illustrates a turning away from the poor after 1800 (p. 115). Setting
                        Germanic Christianity and gloom against liberal Mediterranean classicism,
                        Butler discovers that the early heroes of Byron and Shelley are activists,
                        their later protagonists passive bystanders (p. 125). The same polarization
                        leads to an identification of contradictions in <hi rend="i">Manfred</hi>
                        (p. 122).</p>
          <p>Many of Butler’s past strengths continue in this latest book. I hope
                        that its analysis of rapid fluctuation in taste is accurate enough to
                        predict a short life for this period in which literary historians succumb,
                        at a high price, to the seductions of originality.</p>

          <p>When Sir Geoffrey Keynes began working on Blake, there was no reliable
                        edition of the complete writings, no bibliography, and no catalogue of the
                        separate plates. Keynes provided all these and much, much more. Few other
                        scholars can have contributed so much of the fundemental research on a major
                        figure, and yet Blake has been only one of Keynes’s numerous literary
                        interests, and those interests coexisted with his brilliant career as a
                        surgeon. <hi rend="i">The Gates of Memory</hi> provides us with a
                        fascinating account of the “real Self” of one of the
                        extraordinary figures of our century.</p>
          <p>Keynes’ editorial interests seem to date back to 1902, when he met
                        Rupert Brooke at Rugby. As a result of their ensuing friendship, Keynes
                        began collecting Brooke’s poems; much later he would edit the <hi rend="i">Poetical Works</hi> (1946), <hi rend="i">Bibliography</hi>
                        (1954), and <hi rend="i">Letters</hi> (1968). First authorship also occurred
                        at Rugby with the publication of a prize essay on Roman remains unearthed in
                        a field <pb id="p16-234" n="234"/> in Cambridgeshire. (For his prize, Keynes
                        chose the <hi rend="i">Collected Works of Aubrey Beardsley.</hi>) At
                        Pembroke College, Cambridge, another lifelong interest developed: with his
                        friend Cosmo Gordon, Keynes began to collect works by Sir Thomas Browne. His
                            <hi rend="i">Bibliography of Sir Thomas Browne</hi> was to be published
                        in 1924, and his Browne collection is almost certainly the greatest in
                        private hands today. Another Cambridge acquisition was Henry James in the
                        flesh. In response to an invitation from Keynes and two other undergraduates
                        the Master replied: <q> You are all magnificent &amp; I am dazzled,
                            overwhelmed—deeply affected. I subscribe to everything, delight
                            in the prospect of everything, give myself up to you to do with me
                            whatever best suits your convenience—on which, indeed, <hi rend="i">through</hi> everything, I shall keep my eyes jealously
                            &amp; devoutly fixed. I shall have to tear myself from you on the
                            Tuesday a.m.—&amp; I exhibit the one invidious preference for
                            Tea in one of your gardens (oh delerium!) over even the sight of your
                            contending crews. But for the rest I am of each &amp; all of you the
                            grateful slave, &amp; have gluttonously marked with rapturous accent
                            the items of the list you have so kindly enclosed. (p. 69) </q> The
                        visit itself seems to have been remarkably successful, with James exclaiming
                        at Erasmus’ tower “How intensely venerable!” and
                        punting on the Cam with Rupert Brooke.</p>
          <p>Keynes preparation for the medical profession began in 1910 at St.
                        Bartholomew’s Hospital, an institution with which he was to have an
                        enduring relationship. Outside the hospital, one of his early patients was
                        Virginia Woolf, after a suicide attempt. <q> Leonard Woolf and I dashed
                            through the streets to Bart’s in a taxicab waving aside the
                            policemen (in the then absence of traffic lights) shouting
                            ‘Doctor! Doctor!’ if they tried to stop us. However it was
                            that we accomplished our task, we succeeded. The stomach pump was
                            fetched. (p. 116) </q> It would not be correct to say that
                        Keynes’ medical career was interrupted by World War I, since as a
                        doctor in a field hospital in France he performed thousands of operations
                        and pioneered in techniques of blood transfusion that would later be adopted
                        in peacetime. As a surgeon Keynes no more limited himself to one specialty
                        than he did as a bibliographer. He developed an international reputation for
                        treating both cancer of the breast and myesthenia gravis, the latter a
                        paralytic condition that Keynes learned could be cured by removal of the
                        thymus gland. World War II saw him in uniform once more, this time as Acting
                        Air Vice Marshall in the R.A.F. He retired from medical practice in 1951 and
                        subsequently gave the Harveian Oration to the Royal College of Surgeons and
                        the Oslerian Oration at the Royal College of Physicians. These honors were
                        highly appropriate: Keynes had published his <hi rend="i">Bibliography</hi>
                        of Harvey, (based largely on his own great collection) in 1928 (rev. ed.
                        1953) and would receive the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his <hi rend="i">Life of William Harvey</hi> in 1966, while with Sir William
                        Osler he had enjoyed a long friendship in which medical and bibliographical
                        interests combined.</p>
          <p>It is astonishing to consider that so distinguished a surgeon also became the
                        great pioneer of textual scholarship on Blake. Keynes writes of this
                        combination of vocations: <q> I wanted to advance British surgery if it were
                            possible and to have a full life, intellectually, aesthetically, and
                            humanly, no matter how hard I had to work. Above all, I wanted the
                            understanding and affection of friends and family. It was asking a great
                            deal of life, but not too much. I had found Blake and his conviction
                            that Imagination was the divine gift to the human race and believed that
                            he was right. The gift must therefore be exercised and appreciated in
                            others to the utmost of one’s ability. (p. 221) </q> The stages
                        of work on Keynes’ Blake <hi rend="i">Bibliography</hi> (1921) are
                        recounted in <hi rend="i">Religio Bibliographici</hi>, a Presidential
                        Address to the Bibliographical Society delivered in 1953 and reprinted as an
                        appendix to <hi rend="i">The Gates of Memory.</hi> One cannot help envying
                        the conditions that prevailed when Keynes began his Blake collecting. Before
                        1914 he obtained the seven Dante engravings from the Linnell family for
                        seven guineas, and even in 1942 he was able to buy eleven major items
                        (including the <hi rend="i">Ugolino</hi> recently given to the Fitzwilliam
                        Museum) for £500. But it is not only the early under-valuation of Blake
                        that accounts for the formation of a magnificent collection by a collector
                        of limited means. In acquiring his Blakes, Keynes seems to have combined the
                        astuteness of a detective with the passion of a lover. All those many Blake
                        scholars who have enjoyed the hospitality of Lammas House can testify to the
                        remarkably high quality of each of the treasures there, as well as to the
                        generosity and patience with which Sir Geoffrey shared his knowledge with
                        us, when it often must have seemed to him that we were busily reinventing
                        the wheel.</p>
          <p>Readers of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> need hardly be told in detail of the
                        significance of Keynes’ <hi rend="i">Complete Writings</hi>, first
                        published by Nonesuch in 1927 and still alive and well, after numerous
                        revisions, in the Oxford Standard Authors series. The checklist of
                        Keynes’ writings on Blake from 1910 (when he published a note on
                        “Laughing Song”) to 1972<ref target="n106" type="note">1</ref>
                        is a compendious one, and it now needs to be expanded with the works of
                        another decade, including a third edition of the <hi rend="i">Letters.</hi>
                        Worthy of special mention are the introductions and appendices for the
                        William Blake Trust’s splendid facsimiles. Keynes account of the
                        formation and activities of the Trust also reminds us once more of how much
                        we are indebted to the late Arnold Fawcus, whose Trianon Press produced work
                        of such inestimable quality. <note id="n106"><hi rend="s">1</hi>
                            “Fons et Origo” by G. E. Bentley, Jr., in <hi rend="i">William Blake: Essays in Honour of Sir Geoffrey Keynes</hi>, ed. M.
                            D. Paley and Michael Phillips (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973), pp.
                            349-76.</note></p>
          <p>An unusual byproduct of Keynes’ Blake scholarship was the ballet <hi rend="i">Job: A Masque for Dancing.</hi> With his sister-in-law,<ref target="n107" type="note">2</ref> the artist Gwen Raverat (whose
                        delightful <hi rend="i">Period Piece: A Cambridge Childhood</hi> should be
                        read along with <hi rend="i">The Gates of Memory</hi>), Keynes produced a
                        scenario based on the engraved designs. Ralph Vaughan Williams composed a
                        beautiful score with the understanding <pb id="p16-235" n="235"/> that there
                        was to be no dancing on point (“which made him feel ill”). The
                        idea was then offered to Diaghilev, who turned it down as “too
                        English and too old-fashioned.” In the end, the work was brilliantly
                        choreographed by Ninette de Valois and performed by the Camargo Society in
                        1931. Thence it passed into the repertoire of the Sadler’s Wells
                        Ballet, now the Royal Ballet. A revival of this ballet, so splendidly true
                        to Blake’s vision, is long overdue (hopefully with the restoration of
                        the original Raverat sets rather than the rather inappropriate ones by John
                        Piper that were later substituted for them). <note id="n107"><hi rend="s">2</hi><hi rend="i"> Milton</hi>, 15:27, <hi rend="i">The Complete Writings of

          <p>Space does not permit more than the mere mention of Geoffrey Keynes’
                        other bibliographies: those of John Donne (1915, 4th ed. 1974), the works
                        published by William Pickering (1924), Jane Austen (1929), William Hazlitt
                        (1931), John Evelyn (1937), and Bishop George Berkeley (1977). His
                        achievement as a book collector is indicated by the catalogue of his
                        library, comprising over 4,000 titles, published in 1964. His remarkable
                        life is symbolized for me by one of the many fascinating photographs in this
                        book, showing G.L.K. aged ninety-two in front of the enormous tulip tree at
                        Lammas House. When he died three years later, many a scholar half a century
                        younger felt the loss of one who was at the same time a founder of our
                        discipline and an invigorating contemporary presence—“a friend
                        with whom he liv’d benevolent.”<ref target="n107" type="note">2</ref></p>

          <p>Hispanists consider Juan Ramón Jiménez—the centenary of
                        whose birth on 23 December 1881 has just been celebrated—as a major
                        “modern” European poet. For English readers of poetry,
                        however, his cannot be a familiar name, and the appearance of a full-length
                        study of his readings in Shelley, Yeats, and Blake must come as something of
                        a surprise.</p>
          <p>The author, Howard Young, explored this aspect of Jiménez in earlier
                            research,<ref target="n108" type="note">1</ref> but here for the first
                        time he presents a host of hitherto unknown—and
                        inaccessible—details concerning Jiménez’s readings in
                        the English poets as well as his attempts to translate them into Spanish.
                        The new information Young painstakingly gathered from the Jiménez
                        archives (in Puerto Rico and in Spain) is used, in effect, to re-read Juan
                        Ramón’s poetry. We glimpse a Juan Ramón filtered
                        through the gaze of three English poets. The result is <pb id="p16-236" n="236"/> of indisputable value for Hispanists, especially those with
                        comparatist leanings. The result should also intrigue scholars who study the
                        English poets themselves, and they will certainly interest those of us who
                        believe that insufficient recognition has been given to the contribution
                        made by English Romanticism in the rise of “modern” European
                        poetry. <note id="n108"><hi rend="s">1</hi> “Anglo-American Poetry in

          <p>Juan Ramón Jiménez (1881-1958) is perhaps better known to
                        English readers as a prose-writer. He is the author of <hi rend="i">Platero
                            and I</hi>,—a lyrical novel centering around the friendship that
                        develops between a lonely and impressionable young poet and his donkey on
                        their trips in and around the tiny Andalusian village of Moguer (where
                        Jiménez was born and where he resided until 1912). Though this book
                        has been translated into numerous languages, Jiménez’s
                        reception abroad as a poet is undoubtedly handicapped by the originality of
                        his style, the unique subtlety of which can be appreciated only in Spanish
                        (despite excellent English translations<ref target="n109" type="note">2</ref>. Nor did Jiménez possess the ability—of a Neruda
                        or a Borges—to project himself onto an international audience. He
                        tended to withdraw to concentrate on his work (<hi rend="i">Obra</hi>, he
                        called it). He moved to Madrid in 1912, and in 1916 (in New York) married
                        Zenobia Camprubí Aymar, who was fluent in English and who always
                        assisted him with his English readings. Even in Madrid, the couple’s
                        life was quiet. Jiménez knew he wrote for a small audience, and in
                        fact dedicated his work “To the Immense Minority.” At the
                        outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, in 1936, they left Spain to live in North
                        America, Cuba, and Puerto Rico, where Jiménez concentrated on his
                        spiritual and aesthetic concerns. Though he won the Nobel Prize in 1956, his
                        wife’s death deprived him of the ability to enjoy it, and he himself
                        died two years later, a pathetic figure in exile in Puerto Rico. <note id="n109"><hi rend="s">2</hi> H. R. Hays, <hi rend="i">Selected Writings

          <p>Howard Young is able to show that Jiménez was reading Shelley, Yeats,
                        and Blake throughout these phases in his life. In fact, each move brought
                        with it renewed interest in English (and American) poetry. Young sees
                        Jiménez’s reading as an “attachment” and a
                        “lure” and claims that it moved him “beyond the horizon
                        of his Spanish and French literary inheritance to discover confirmation of
                        some of his basic ideas and to delight in a new tone and different
                        perspectives for evoking the ideals and mysteries that beguiled symbolist
                        poets.” To appreciate that claim, we need to know something about
                        Jiménez’s poetry and its historical situation.</p>
          <p>Juan Ramón’s first poems are termed <hi rend="i">modernista</hi> by Hispanic literary critics. <hi rend="i">Modernismo</hi> is not at all what <hi rend="i">Modernism</hi> is in
                        the Anglo-American world. In general it is taken to be the style of the
                        latter part of the nineteenth century, a form of Art Nouveau (as Young
                        implies). It has certain similarities with “Aestheticism” and
                        “Pre-Raphaelitism” in England, and
                        “Parnassianism” and “Symbolism” in France.
                        Jiménez’s <hi rend="i">modernista</hi> poetry appeared in
                        1900, in two small volumes, <hi rend="i">Ninfeas (Waterlilies)</hi> and <hi rend="i">Almas de violeta</hi> (<hi rend="i">Violet-souls</hi>); the
                        former were printed in green and the latter in purple ink. Here is a stanza
                        from the “Water-lilies’ Symphony”: “On the lake
                        of blood of my grieving soul, / from the melancholy garden of my weeping
                        soul; / on the lake of blood of a suspiring Love, / on which a most sad swan
                        entones a dying wail. . . .”<ref target="n110" type="note">3</ref> It
                        must come as little surprise to be told that Jiménez repudiated and
                        systematically destroyed these volumes in later life. The artificiality he
                        rejected, but the aesthetic idealism he internalized. His dominant style,
                        until around 1913, is that of a minor symbolist and impressionist. He is a
                        pantheistic lover of nature, a sentimental sensualist; he is self-absorbed
                        and withdrawn, and at times a bitterly disillusioned idealist. Toward the
                        end of this first period in his work, he wrote: “Even as we return
                        the golden moon is shining on the ramparts . . . / a breath of
                        flowers-cum-moon invades the countryside . . . , / the heart becomes
                        melodious and romantic . . . / / Even the love complete has a tragic
                        meaning; / in the gaze of impassioned eyes / the dream of life floats,
                        immense and nostalgic . . . / / we find slow hands in our hands . . . , / we
                        find breasts brushing against our arms, / we find mute lips on our lips . .
                        .” (<hi rend="i">PLP</hi> 1406). This poem is part of the section on
                            <hi rend="i">Melancolía (Melancholy</hi>, published in 1912)
                        dedicated to Louise Grimm de Muriedas, a cultivated North American who, as
                        Howard Young discovered, introduced Juan Ramón to the work of various
                        English poets. <note id="n110"><hi rend="s">3</hi> Juan Ramón

          <p>Jiménez’s exposure to English (and American) poetry is
                        certainly one of the contibuting factors to the stunning change that
                        overcomes his work after 1913. The dreamy sentimentalism and self-indulgent
                        pessimism are gone, replaced by precision, deliberate control and cerebral
                        rigor. “Intelligence, give me / the exact name of things!”<ref target="n111" type="note">4</ref> is one of his more famous poems of
                        this time. It is as though Juan Ramón reacted utterly against his
                        former poetic personae. Instead of failure, he now encounters (in the figure
                        of his wife Zenobia) a love that is ideal: “All roses are the same
                        rose; / love!, the unique rose; / and all’s contained in it, / brief
                        image of the world, / love, the unique rose” (<hi rend="i">LP</hi>
                        909). He now sees in the real what was before considered eternally elusive.

          <p>Jiménez acquired a reputation for the metaphysical (existential) reach
                        of his poetry. His <hi rend="i">Diario de un poeta reciencasado (Diary of a
                            poet newlywed</hi>, 1916) introduced into Hispanic poetry a poetic
                        subject struggling with the chaos and absurdity of contemporary life who
                        nevertheless quests for integration and harmony. We read the sea symbol in
                        his <hi rend="i">Diary</hi> as indicative of poetic thought at the beginning
                        of this “modern” age experiencing the disintegration of all
                        cherished values and ideals: “It seems, sea, that you’re
                        struggling / —oh endless disorder, unceasing iron!— / to find
                        yourself, or for me to find you” (<hi rend="i">LP</hi> 259).</p>
          <p>Jiménez acquired the reputation for being a fastidious elitist in
                        matters poetic. He is a “high-modern,” in the <pb id="p16-237" n="237"/> manner of Valéry (and Mallarmé) and Yeats. In
                        this persona, Jùan Ramón sees himself as living only for his
                        poetry: “Poetry; dew / of each dawn, child / of each night”
                            (<hi rend="i">LP</hi> 881). He becomes an entity that creates, oblivious
                        to temporal flow: “To create myself, to recreate myself, to empty
                        myself, until / he who goes dead, from me, one day, / to earth, will not be
                        me” (<hi rend="i">LP</hi> 1003).</p>
          <p>Related to this ideal is Jiménez’s struggle to overcome his
                        fear of death (a frequent topic in the early poetry and one that brought him
                        much attention). Juan Ramón achieved renown by claiming “To
                        die is only to look within” (<hi rend="i">LP</hi> 899) and that
                        “Death is an ancient mother of ours, / our first mother, who loves us
                        through all others, century in, century out / and never, never forgets
                        us.” (<hi rend="i">LP</hi> 1088). The poet, in this second phase of
                        his work, appears to be in complete control of all he touches, the master of
                        his universe, and that, in general, is Jiménez’s reputation as
                        a poet today.</p>
          <p>There is, however, a third Jiménez, one that emerges more clearly in
                        the poetry written in exile after 1936. In this period, we hear, as Yeats
                        might have remarked, the voices of an ecstatic “saint”
                        alternating with those of a sceptic “hunchback.” The ecstatic
                        and visionary poetry is encountered in, for example, <hi rend="i">Animal de
                            Fondo (Animal of depth</hi>, 1949). The vision in the poem “Soy
                        animal de fondo” (“I’m an animal of
                        depth”)—an image Ezra Pound used in the <hi rend="i">Cantos</hi>—is one of transcendence linked to temporal flow, an
                        immanent transcendence, of the beyond flourishing with the here and now.
                        These two “realities” fuse because the poet has cultivated
                        both throughout his lifetime. The poem begins: “ ‘In the depth
                        of air’ (I said) ‘I am’, / (I said) ‘I’m
                        an animal with depth of air’ (on land), / now on sea; shot through,
                        like air, by a sun / that’s a coal up there, my outside, and lights
                        up for me / with its coal my second destined ambit” (<hi rend="i">LP</hi> 1339).</p>
          <p>In competition with this ecstatic visionary is the sceptic, the doubter, who
                        in “Río-mar-desierto”
                        (“River-seadesert”), after Shelley and Yeats, contemplates
                        with equanimity the “detaining of his wave” (“la ola
                        detenida”), who experiences the river of his life changing into
                        desert sand. But such philosophical resignation is absent in 1954, in the
                        “Third Fragment” of a long prose poem called <hi rend="i">Espacio (Space);</hi> the poetic voice here cries to its consciousness:
                        “Doesn’t it pain you to leave me? . . . Didn’t you like
                        my life? I searched and found your essence for you. What substance can the
                        gods give to your essence that I couldn’t give you? I have already
                        told you: ‘The gods had no more substance than what I had.’
                            ”<ref target="n112" type="note">5</ref><note id="n112"><hi rend="s">5</hi> Juan Ramón Jiménez, <hi rend="i">En el otro costado</hi>, ed. Aurora de Albornoz (Madrid:
                            Júcar, 1974), pp. 82-83.</note></p>
          <p>The reader must surely hear Blake in these lines, and indeed this is one of
                        the topics Howard Young discusses in “The Substance of the
                        Gods,” one of the seven sections he devotes to his study of Blake in
                        Juan Ramón. Young is able to demonstrate that Blake’s impact
                        is still felt by what we termed the “third” Jiménez.
                        Shelley is more important in the first period of his work; then Yeats takes
                        over (Jiménez read Yeats’ essays on Shelley). Though Yeats is
                        present in the third phase, Young amply demonstrates the parallels with
                        Blake.</p>
          <p>Young’s study begins with Shelley because, as Young discovered,
                        Shelley was the first of the three that Juan Ramón read. He read him
                        in a Spanish translation, published by “the British hispanophile
                        Leonard Williams” in 1904, which contained <hi rend="i">A Defence of
                            Poetry</hi>, “On Love,” and “A Discourse on the
                        Manners of the Ancients Relative to the Subject of Love.” Young
                        analyzes the passages marked off by Juan Ramón, and he also discusses
                        his subsequent attempts to translate a few poems (e.g.
                        “Mutability” and “Hymn to Intellectual Beauty”).
                        Young’s thesis is that the Platonism of the <hi rend="i">Defence</hi>, together with the Platonic idealism prevalent in contemporary
                        schools of Spanish philosophy, encouraged Jiménez to overcome his <hi rend="i">modernista</hi> heritage. Shelley is read as helping to
                        convince Juan Ramón that poetry is unquestionably the form
                        “Beauty” chooses to take in this world, and moreover, that the
                        poet, in the moment of the poem, sees “Beauty,” and therefore
                        “Good,” more clearly than any other sentient being.
                        Jiménez was dimly aware of these ideals when he first began writing,
                        as the “Water-lilies’ Symphony” (the first quatrain of
                        which is cited above) implies in the image of a poet suffering to create
                        Beauty and Love. Later, the idealism becomes clearer to him and he expresses
                        it more subtly, as a poem from <hi rend="i">Laberinto</hi> (published 1913)
                        reveals: “Like a quiet river, on the paper, the brow / reflects,
                        sadly, the words, / that vibrate in its heavens, like the golden notes / of
                        a labyrinth of bells. . . . ” Words have become musical notes that
                        form a vague piece of architecture that contains “something from the
                        beyond, that reaches life / along a path of nostalgia” (<hi rend="i">PLP</hi> 1273). The style here more befits a symbolist, and the
                        idealism is recognizably Platonic.</p>
          <p>Howard Young shows that Shelley’s thoughts on love also impressed
                        Jiménez. He goes on to note that the Spanish poet shared
                        Shelley’s ideals about woman, and he proposes the fascinating
                        interpretation that the Spanish poet’s numerous maidens be read as
                        ideal projections of the elusive antitype. There is indeed an array of
                        “beloveds” in Juan Ramón’s early phase, and to
                        read them as a desire to fill the vacuum within, to suggest that they are
                        part of the narcissistic search for the “other,” is to
                        stimulate future readings of the poet’s work.</p>
          <p>In addition, Young maintains that Shelley’s transcendental attitude
                        toward love, in a “Discourse on the Manner . . . ,” would have
                        helped free Jiménez from the “unadulterated sensuality”
                        that was part of his poetic patrimony (through the Nicaraguan, Rubén
                        Darío) but with which Jiménez never felt at ease. Young also
                        suggests that in Jiménez’s poetry there is a development of
                        the “veiled maiden” symbol; the veils are removed and
                        “ideal nakedness,” not disillusion, is experienced. At the end
                        of one of his famous poems “Vino, primero, pura, / <pb id="p16-238" n="238"/> vestida de inocencia” (“She came, first, pure, /
                        dressed in innocence”), whose parellels with Yeats’s “A
                        Coat” are taken up later by Young, the poet exclaims: “And she
                        took off her tunic, / and appeared completely naked . . . / O passion of my
                        life, naked / poetry, mine forever!” (<hi rend="i">LP</hi> 555). This
                        “lifelong quest for the spirit of beauty,” Young notes,
                        reaches a “joyous conclusion” in <hi rend="i">Animal of
                            depth.</hi></p>
          <p>If Juan Ramón’s interest in Shelley faded around 1920, his
                        fascination with Yeats and Blake increased. Yeats, of course, was more or
                        less a contemporary, and Jiménez certainly considered him, with
                        reverence, as a peer whose interests were compatible (witness their
                        enthusiasm for Tagore). Jiménez bought and read Yeats’s
                        dramas, his essays and his poems. He read them in English with the help of
                        his wife, who translated Yeats’s early plays into Spanish with
                        Yeats’s permission. (Nothing was ever published, but <hi rend="i">The
                            Countess Cathleen</hi> survives.) Jiménez himself translated
                        about a dozen poems, some of which were published (in the 1940s). Juan
                        Ramón liked a little known “Preface” Yeats wrote for
                        three of his plays, and adapted from it the notion of “spontaneous
                        simplicity” when he was trying to explain his own “naked
                        poetry.” For Jiménez, “spontaneous simplicity”
                        is captured in art only after prolonged and intensive reworking.</p>
          <p>Like Yeats, Jiménez was fascinated by the “rose” and its
                        connotative power. Young shows that he knew “The Rose of All the
                        World” and Yeats’ essay on “Magic.”
                        Jiménez used the rose much more extensively than Yeats but was never
                        as committed to the occult (despite, as Young has discovered, being a
                        sensitive medium when he was a student). In later life Jiménez would
                        refer to “Destiny,” and Young shows that Yeats discussed this
                        in <hi rend="i">Per Amica Silentia Lunae</hi>, a work the Spanish poet knew.
                        Jiménez must in fact have read more of Yeats than we can know (that
                        is, more than his libraries hold today). He cites from “Crazy Jane
                        Talks to the Bishop,” for instance, in <hi rend="i">Space</hi>, but
                        we have no record of his having read this poem. “Love in the palace
                        of excrement” is how he recalled the lines, as though they had been
                        transfixed in his mind for some time. My own suspicion is that the impact
                        Yeats made was stronger than Young would allow in his study.</p>
          <p>But with Blake, Young’s perspective broadens—he sees
                        Jiménez as bringing to a conclusion, in the 1950s, the tradition of
                        the poet as visionary humanist, which Blake began at the dawn of the
                        nineteenth century. Young writes that “Blake is the Modern prophet of
                        the imagination divine, who also worshipped <hi rend="i">lo desnudo</hi>
                        (the naked),” and adds that “Just as Blake signals the opening
                        of modern phase of this tradition of the poet qua divinity, so the <hi rend="i">dios deseado y deseante</hi> (god desired and desiring)
                        announces its conclusion. For as Pablo Neruda said in Stockholm some twenty
                        years after the publication of <hi rend="i">Animal of depth</hi>, “El
                        poeta no es un ‘pequeño dios.’ ” [“Poets
                        are not ‘little gods.’”] For this reason, Young offers
                        in his final sixty pages a comparison of parallel concerns in Jiménez
                        and Blake.</p>
          <p>Young acknowledges that Jiménez would have been a naive reader of
                        Blake, as he could not have deciphered the symbolism. Despite this, he
                        “carefully read nearly all the lyrical canon of Blake,”
                        beginning around 1916 with Quiller-Couch’s <hi rend="i">Oxford
                            Book</hi>, and continuing in 1927 when the Cambridge Hispanist J. B.
                        Trend gave him Blake’s collected poetry and prose. Young shows that
                        Juan Ramón translated “The Tyger,” “To the
                        Muses,” “A Poison Tree,” “The Sick Rose,”
                        and “The Little Black Boy,” as well as intending to translate
                        two dozen or more (including nothing less than <hi rend="i">The Marriage of
                            Heaven and Hell</hi> and <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of
                            Albion</hi>). We also learn that Juan Ramón valued Blake’s
                        “bold nudes” and that on a copy of “The Temptation of
                        Eve” he wrote “Influencia de Blake” (“Influence
                        of Blake”).<ref target="n113" type="note">6</ref> Jiménez
                        himself drew nude figures and found in the naked woman a symbol of complete
                        fulfillment. <note id="n113"><hi rend="s">6</hi> Jiménez’s
                            “Temptation of Eve” was a black and white reproduction of
                            this water color, which he cut from <hi rend="i">The New York Times Book
                                Review</hi>, 20 Nov. 1927, p. 2. In his discussion of the nude
                            figure, Young refers to “Glad Day,” “Urizen
                            Creating” and “Albion Adoring the Crucified Christ”
                            (pp. 220-30). He also notes that Jiménez had a copy of Philippe
                            Soupault’s 1928 study <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi>, which
                            contains “fifty plates with a wide range of samples from
                            Blake’s production.”</note></p>
          <p>For Hispanists, all of this information is novel. It was known that
                        Jiménez translated a few poems and made a few references to Blake,
                        but the extent of his interest is astounding. It confirms, at least for this
                        reader, a point that Howard Young is tacitly making: that Jiménez was
                        far too original a poet to remain satisfied with his own
                        “latin” poetic tradition (Jiménez’s word). His
                        passion for exploring this alien tradition—Young is more circumspect,
                        for, as we noted, he calls it an “attachment”—was
                        dictated by his need to survive as a poet. His Spanish and French literary
                        inheritance stifled him, and he discovered in the “northern”
                        lyric (his word) sufficient inspiration to keep him alive poetically. The
                        “anxiety of influence” begins to take on strange proportions.
                        We mention only the poets, but there are the real individuals from this
                        alien tradition who also contributed in their incidental ways: Leonard
                        Williams, Louise Grimm, and J. B. Trend we have mentioned; and there was
                        also Lennox Robinson (the director of the Abbey Theatre after Yeats).</p>
          <p>Literary history must yield to literary criticism, and that is how the book
                        ends. Young compares Blake and Jiménez, to show, I think, that
                        Jiménez is unjustly underrated as a European “modern.”
                        Juan Ramón shared with Blake the belief that “imagination is
                        all.” He held this idealism until the last years of his life. He
                        shared with Blake, especially in his later work, “God desired and
                        desiring,” the experience of Eternity in the here and now, not in
                        some “indefinite heaven of Platonic abstraction.” As in Blake,
                        Young notes, in Jiménez the “childlike” forms an
                        integral part of his final vision, into which, notes Young, Juan
                        Ramón incorporates the “innocence, freshness, and suspicion of
                        divinity . . . that clings to children.” As far as nakedness is
                        concerned, Young argues that though the naked human body is put to similar
                        symbolic use by Jiménez, the Spanish poet was never as comfortable
                        with it as Blake was. And finally, in discussing Blake’s conviction
                        that the human mind itself creates that which is divine, Young refers to
                        Juan Ramón’s cry <pb id="p16-239" n="239"/> that “The
                        gods had no more substance than what I have” and argues that in his
                        later work Jiménez is struggling to integrate such apocalyptic
                        humanism with his earlier and deeply entrenched Platonism. Though we at
                        times see him as “shoring fragments against his ruins,” we
                        also see, with Young, Juan Ramón bringing to a successful conclusion
                        Blake’s prophecies that art is a religion, that the artist’s
                        is a divine calling, that the human form be glorified and life deified, and
                        that man encounter paradise, discover immanent and transcendent gods, within
                        the human mind.</p>
          <p>Juan Ramón Jiménez was perhaps the first European in this
                        century to discover Blake’s importance. The Spanish surrealists in
                        the 1920s saw Blake as a surrealist, and Jiménez argued against this
                        view. Students of Blake today might be intrigued by what they see as
                        Jiménez’s “misreading” of their poet, but
                        students of Jiménez, especially those who see him as much more than a
                        “Peninsular” poet, will be long in debt to Howard Young for
                        this challenging reassessment of a poet who deserves to be read with the
                        major European “moderns” of this century.</p>
