          </head>
          <byline>By <docAuthor>Robert N. <name>Essick</name></docAuthor></byline>
          <p>I begin by updating the introductory comments in my 2003 and 2004 sales reviews (<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 37.4 [spring 2004]: 116-17, and 38.4 [spring 2005]: 124-25). In the former, I told the story of Blake’s rediscovered watercolors for Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>; their most recent adventures are reported below under Drawings and Paintings. In the 2004 review, I commented on the rediscovery of <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> copy N and the legal controversy over its ownership. In early February 2005 I learned from Christine von der Linn of Swann (formerly Swann Galleries), the New York auction house, that a member (or members) of the Whitney family, in whose possession the volume resided for many years, had won the case, apparently out of court, against the man who brought the book to Swann. As far as I can determine, the book is now owned by, and in the physical possession of, a member or members of the Whitney family. John Windle, the San Francisco book dealer who specializes in Blake, has been told that there are no current plans to sell the book.</p>
          <p>I was not able to inspect <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> copy N while it was at Swann, but Windle saw the volume only a few days before its return to the Whitney family. He found on a front flyleaf the following, previously unrecorded, pencil inscription:
<q>
1848<lb/>
12 8th paid 70s<lb/>
for this to<lb/>
A Evans &amp; Son [ampersand and final word unclear]<lb/>
London<lb/>
RT [possibly “RL”]<lb/>
4 guineas was <hi rend="u">asked</hi> for it
</q>
I interpret this to mean that RT (or RL) purchased the book from the London dealer A. Evans &amp; Son, probably on 8 December (or possibly 12 August) 1848, paying 70 shillings. The asking price had been 4 guineas (84 shillings). The provenance prior to 1878, as recorded in <hi rend="i">BB</hi> #476, for <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> copy N is speculative. This inscription adds a new twist to the book’s history. Unfortunately, I have not been able to make even a good guess as to the identity of RT or RL.</p>
          <p>I also reported in my 2004 review on several works by Blake from the late George Goyder’s collection, including the removal of the tempera painting, <hi rend="i">The Christ Child Asleep on a Cross</hi> (Butlin #410), from the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, where it had been on deposit for some years. I learned in February 2005 that another Blake tempera, <hi rend="i">Christ the Mediator</hi> (Butlin #429), had been withdrawn by the Goyder family from deposit at the Tate Collection in late summer 2004. The third tempera from the Goyder collection, <hi rend="i">The Flight into Egypt</hi> (Butlin #404), remains on deposit with the Tate after an unsuccessful attempt by that institution to raise funds to purchase the work. <hi rend="i">Christ the Mediator</hi>, by far the best painting of the three, was offered at a Christie’s London auction on 14 June 2005 with an estimate of £500,000-800,000 (illus. 1). There was only one bidder, an unidentified party on the telephone, who simply bid against the reserve price until winning the lot at £450,000 (£512,000 with the buyer’s premium). Given the estimate range, the price must have disappointed both the vendor and the auction house, but <hi rend="i">Christ the Mediator</hi> still managed to set a record for a tempera painting by Blake.</p>
          <p>A visually less impressive work, but a more famous representation of Blake’s imaginative range than most of his biblical paintings, is his full-length portrait of <hi rend="i">The Ghost of a Flea</hi> from the Smaller Blake-Varley Sketchbook of c. 1819 (illus. 2). The sketchbook was dismembered and auctioned leaf by leaf at Christie’s London in 1971. The flea returned to the same rooms on 9 June 2005 with a cautious estimate of £4000-6000. The auction catalogue included an exceedingly poor illustration that turned the paper tone to a medium gray and the drawing into a ghost of the ghost of a flea. There were also rumors that the drawing had been fiddled with in recent years (see the caption to illus. 2). But collectors and dealers were not put off. There were at least 3 bidders still in the game at £30,000—Windle, the British Blake collector Alan Parker, and someone on the telephone. Windle dropped out at that point, with Parker the victor on a bid of £72,000 (£86,400 inclusive of the buyer’s premium). Alan Parker is the son of the railroad executive and Blake collector Sir Peter Parker (1924-2002).</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">The Ghost of a Flea</hi> establishes a new record price for any uncolored drawing by Blake. Its sale also buttresses my suspicion that, with many of Blake’s works, the usual standards of aesthetic appreciation and connoisseurship are not helpful in establishing market values. This slight pencil sketch of a humanized flea (or an insectivorous human) is less a “work of art,” as a consensus of dealers and collectors would normally define that term, than a documentary record of an extraordinary mind.</p>
          <p>Bloomsbury Auctions (formerly Bloomsbury Book Auctions) included a large number of Blake items in its London sale of 20-21 April. The few original works that fit within the purview of this report are listed below, but the most notable feature of the auction was the high prices fetched by the facsimiles of Blake’s illuminated books produced by the Trianon Press for the William Blake Trust. For example, <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, 1 of 526 copies published in 1955, achieved £547 on an estimate of £150-200. The <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>, with a press run of 1600 copies in 1954, has always been one of the least expensive Trianon facsimiles, but was priced at £368 in a special “William Blake” list issued in May by the London dealer Henry Sotheran Ltd. In the same month, a copy of the 1951 facsimile of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> copy E, lacking the 
<pb id="p39-149" n="149"/>
publisher’s folding box, fetched $1136 on eBay. Perhaps these facsimiles are finally becoming rare, after being a drug on the market for several decades, and attracting the attention their quality deserves.</p>
          <p>In <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 31.4 (spring 1998): 113, I reproduced an impression of Blake’s famous “The Ancient of Days” (the frontispiece to <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>), 1 of only 2 remaining in private hands. This impression and its questionable hand coloring came to my attention once again in May 2005. Glenn Horowitz, a New York City book and manuscript dealer acting on behalf of the owner, sent the print to Windle, who in turn brought it to me for study. After two hours of intense observation and speculation, followed by a telephone consultation with Joseph Viscomi, who saw the print in 1998, we came to a conclusion similar to the one I proposed in the caption to the 1998 illustration: the impression was printed by Blake, but probably hand colored, at least in part, by someone other than Blake or his wife Catherine, and was used by William Muir in 1887 as the model for his coloring of the frontispiece in his facsimile of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (but not for his separate facsimiles of “The Ancient of Days”). Muir probably believed that the coloring was by Blake, in spite of the careless handling of the rose-red tints on the clouds. The coloring on the figure is more controlled and convincing; perhaps two different artists were responsible for these different styles. Windle offered to acquire the print but without success. He returned it to Horowitz by the end of May, who in turn returned it to the present owner, an American private collector. See “The Ancient of Days” under “Illuminated Books,” below, for further information.<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref><note id="n1">1. The present owner of this impression of “The Ancient of Days” acquired, and generously forwarded to me, a digital image of the impression in brick-red ink with gray wash in the Rosenbach Museum and Library, Philadelphia (copy A in <hi rend="i">BB</hi> 108-09). The ink color and flat printing suggest that this is probably a posthumous impression. The broad, thin washes are similar to those found in some posthumous impressions of plates from <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>—for example, “The Fly” in copy h (Essick collection).</note></p>
          <p>While in pursuit of books with illustrations by Thomas Stothard, I was lucky enough to turn up a previously unrecorded reprinting of one of Blake’s rarer copy engravings, “F: Revolution” after Charles Reuben Ryley, first published in <hi rend="i">Bellamy’s Picturesque Magazine</hi>, 1793. See <hi rend="i">The Cabinet of the Arts</hi> under “Letterpress Books with Engravings by and after Blake,” below, and illus. 4-5. More important discoveries of 2005 include the pencil sketch, <hi rend="i">Satan Going To and Fro in the Earth, and Another Figure</hi>, unrecorded (or at least unknown to me) until its publication in Christie’s auction cat. of 17 November. For details, see under “Drawings and Paintings,” below, and illus. 3. Finally, a previously unrecorded posthumous impression of one of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> came to light in a 25 November sale at Bloomsbury Auctions—see the “Introduction” plate under “Illuminated Books,” below.</p>
          <p>In November, Windle published the sixth in his series of sales catalogues devoted to Blake and his circle. This is the largest yet, with 431 numbered items, and possibly the largest Blake sales catalogue ever issued. Highlights include 3 different printings of the Job engravings, 5 copies of Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> with Blake’s designs, the rare <hi rend="i">Leonora</hi> of 1796 with Blake’s illustrations, 2 copies of the 1821 Virgil with Blake’s wood engravings, 3 copies of Wollstonecraft’s <hi rend="i">Original Stories</hi>, each with different states of Blake’s plates, 3 copies of the 1797 <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, and an almost complete run of Muir facsimiles (on which Windle has a near monopoly). All these materials, plus many others normally covered by this sales review, are listed below.</p>
          <p>The Pierpont Morgan Library in New York houses one of the few institutional Blake collections to have acquired significant works in recent years. Thanks to their online catalogue (&lt;http://corsair.morganlibrary.org&gt;) and the assistance of Anna Lou Ashby, I have been able to record below these acquisitions—see under Drawings and Paintings and under Manuscripts in the sales list below, plus the appendix for prints. Apologies for my tardiness in recording these additions to the Morgan’s collection.</p>
          <p>The year of all sales and catalogues in the following lists is 2005 unless indicated otherwise. Works offered online and previously listed in either of the last 2 sales reviews are not repeated here. The auction houses add their purchaser’s surcharge to the hammer price in their price lists. These net amounts are given here, following the official price lists. The value-added tax levied against the buyer’s surcharge in Britain is not included. Late 2005 sales will be covered in the 2006 review. I am grateful for help in compiling this review to Marcia Allentuck, Anna Lou Ashby, Martin Bailey, Nancy Bialler, David Bindman, Harriet Drummond, William Drummond, William Goyder, Robin Hamlyn, Christine von der Linn, Tim Linnell, Joseph Viscomi, Rachel Weinstein, Steve Weissman, Angus Whitehead, and John Windle. My special thanks go to Alexander Gourlay for his generosity in keeping me abreast of internet auctions. Once again, Sarah Jones’ editorial expertise and John Sullivan’s electronic imaging have been invaluable.</p>

            <p>“The Ancient of Days” (the frontispiece to <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> when presumably printed as a separate plate), copy D (see <hi rend="i">BB</hi> 109), printed in dark gray-blue on wove paper (sheet 24.2 × 17.7 cm.) without watermark, partly tinted with watercolors. Mounted in a window cut in another sheet of paper (30.7 × 23.7 cm.) with hand-drawn framing lines in brown ink just outside the printed sheet, the mounting sheet showing evidence of having once been bound along the left margin. The mounting sheet inscribed in pencil “2” (top left) and “From Europe, frontispiece” (bottom left). Probably printed in 1794 with the impressions in the Essick collection (blue-green ink), the Keynes Collection, Fitzwilliam Museum (dark blue ink), and the Yale Center for British Art (brown ink). Presently framed and glazed, with a framer’s label on the backing board inscribed in blue ink, “12-29-76.” Offered for sale by the New York dealer Glenn Horowitz in May to the San Francisco dealer John Windle, but withdrawn. Probably pasted into its present mount, and the mount inscribed, by George A. Smith c. 1853 when the print was included as part of the large collection of Blake prints bound with the manuscript “Order in which the Songs of Innocence and Experience Ought to be Paged” (see <hi rend="i">BB</hi> #125). This impression of “The Ancient of Days” has a subsequent history of ownership to 1938 that can be traced through <hi rend="i">BB</hi> 337-40 (listed as item 100 on p. 339). At the auction of the George C. Smith collection, Parke-Bernet, New York, 2 Nov. 1938, what I believe to be this print was incorrectly described in the cat., #28, as printed in “black” ink and sold for $300 to a “private buyer” (<hi rend="i">BB</hi> 340). According to a handwritten note in black ink on the framer’s label and information kindly supplied by the present owner, the print’s subsequent provenance is as follows: probably the American book collector A. E. Newton (perhaps the purchaser at the 1938 auction); probably the Newton auction, Parke-Bernet, 16 April 1941, #130 (apparently bought-in at $175 or sold to A. E. Newton’s daughter, Caroline Newton); Caroline Newton; given by her shortly after the 1941 auction to the poet W. H. Auden; by bequest upon Auden’s death in 1973 to Chester Kallman; by inheritance in 1975 to his father, Edward Kallman; by inheritance in the early 1980s to his wife, Dorothy Farnan; given by her in 1998 to the present owner, an American private collector. See also the discussion in the essay prefatory to this sales review.</p>
            <p>“Introduction” to <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience.</hi> A previously unrecorded posthumous impression in gray-black ink on wove paper without watermark, the sheet trimmed to 17.9 × 11.0 cm. to match the leaf size of a copy of William Pickering’s 1839 ed. of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, into which this impression is bound as a frontispiece. Platemark 12.5 × 7.3 cm. (slightly larger than lifetime impressions, as is the case with all posthumous impressions). Inscribed in pencil below the image, “See P. 37.” (a reference to the page in the Pickering ed. on which the “Introduction” poem begins). Inscribed in pencil on the verso of the print, probably in the same hand, “From a print shop in West Street, / given me by my Bro’ in Law / M<hi rend="s">r</hi>.W. M. H. / 1857, / A. H.” The recto of the front flyleaf inscribed in ink, “Adelaide A. L. Hewetson. / From her husband, with affection. / 15<hi rend="s">th</hi> Nov. 1861.” Adelaide Hewetson was the wife of John Hewetson (died 1876); they may have been related to H. Bendelack Hewetson, whose book of 1880, <hi rend="i">The Influence of Joy upon the Workman and His Work</hi>, contains reproductions of two of Blake’s illustrations to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> (see <hi rend="i">BB</hi> #407). In the pencil inscription on the verso of the print, “A. H.” is no doubt Adelaide Hewetson; “W. M. H.” must have been her husband’s brother (possibly one William M. Hewetson?). Another pencil inscription, on the verso of the front free endpaper, briefly describes the life of “Roger Langois,” an artist said to be a “pupil of Flaxman’s.” This inscription seems unrelated to either the print or the book. The end of the “Preface,” xxi, signed in pencil by the editor, “J. J. G. Wilkinson.” On the same page, lower left, inscribed in pencil in a different hand (perhaps Adelaide Hewetson’s), “Finchley Road &amp; / 76 Wimpole St.” Sold BA, 25 Nov., #746, issue of the book lacking “The Little Vagabond,” described only as “Songs of Innocence and of Experience, frontispiece by Blake, slightly foxed and browned, contemporary calf, a little rubbed, gilt spine, 8vo, 1839” (£2618 to J. Windle, in partnership with Maggs Bros., on an estimate of £200-300). The auction house failed to recognize what it was selling, but the price suggests that at least two bidders did know the nature of the inserted print.</p>

The title was first given to the painting by William Michael Rossetti in his catalogue of Blake’s works published in Alexander Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi> (London: Macmillan, 1863) 2: 231, #200. The design probably takes its subject from 1 Timothy 2.5-6: “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.” Christ, assuming a cruciform posture, asks God the Father, sitting in judgment on the right, to be merciful to the female figure in the left foreground who bows in supplication. She is identified as Mary Magdalene by W. Graham Robertson in the manuscript catalogue of his collection, later published as <hi rend="i">The Blake Collection of W. Graham Robertson</hi>, ed. Kerrison Preston (London: Faber and Faber, 1952) 156. Perhaps Christ is preventing, with his own body, the flames of divine wrath from harming the Magdalene. If she is a representative of all sinners, then Christ is performing an act similar to his self-sacrifice on the cross as “a ransom for all.” Winged angels attend upon the scene and also appear to be asking the Father to be forgiving.

Collection of Alan Parker, London; photo courtesy of Christie’s London, where the drawing was sold on 9 June 2005, #13 (£86,400). Previously sold CL, 15 June 1971, #141 (£2100 to the London bookseller Martin Breslauer), and offered by Breslauer, June 1972 cat. 102, #95 (£3800). Inscribed by William Bell Scott, who owned the sketchbook from 1870 to c. 1890, “Sketch of the entire figure of of [sic] the Emblem (or Ghost) of a Flea mentioned by Varley in ‘Treatise on Zodiacal Physiognomy’” (lower left), and “See a paper on this sketch in the Portfolio July 71 by me W.B.S.” (lower right). Although probably not visible in this illus., the paper is whiter and abraded just left of the creature’s left thigh, extending from his elbow to his right leg. Some of the pencil lines bounding this area may have been strengthened by someone other than Blake.<lb/><lb/>
In his discussion of Blake’s vision of the flea, John Varley notes that “this spirit afterwards appeared to Blake, and afforded him a view of his whole figure, an engraving of which I shall give in this work” (Varley, <hi rend="i">A Treatise on Zodiacal Physiognomy</hi> [London: the author, 1828] 55). Varley intended to issue further installments of his treatise, but none was published and there is no further record or extant impression of the proposed “engraving” of this full-length sketch. The “paper” referenced by Scott in his inscription on the drawing is his essay, “A Varley-and-Blake Sketch-Book,” <hi rend="i">The Portfolio: An Artistic Periodical</hi> 2 (1871): 102-05. The article contains lithographic reproductions of Scott’s copies of drawings in the sketchbook, including the full-length ghost of a flea and the drawing of the head alone on a different leaf (Butlin #692.98, since 1940 in the Tate Collection). Two pls. engraved by John Linnell and published in Varley’s <hi rend="i">Treatise</hi> reproduce this head, both mouth closed and mouth open. The latter is based on a detail of the flea’s open mouth on the same sketchbook leaf as the whole head; only the closed-mouth version is reproduced by Scott in his 1871 essay. Blake’s tempera painting of the full-length flea is not directly related to the pencil sketch illus. here but probably also dates from c. 1819-20 (Butlin #750, since 1949 in the Tate Collection).<lb/><lb/>
Butlin records this pencil drawing in a “Private Collection, Great Britain.” The cat. for the 9 June 2005 auction lists a provenance with no owner intervening between the drawing’s purchase by the firm of Martin Breslauer and its sale “from the Estate of Dr Bernard Breslauer,” Martin Breslauer’s son and successor in the bookselling business. The “Private Collection” was apparently that of Bernard Breslauer, although it is also possible that there was some other owner who returned the drawing to the Breslauer firm and family.<lb/><lb/>
Except for a caricature of John Varley as an elephant (Butlin #690 verso), the drawings of the flea are the only portrayals of an animal (or semi-animal) among Blake’s many so-called “Visionary Heads” he drew at Varley’s behest. Blake’s depictions of the insect were probably influenced by a large, unsigned engraving of a flea, as seen through a microscope, published in Robert Hooke, <hi rend="i">Micrographia: Or Some Physiological Descriptions of Minute Bodies Made by Magnifying Glasses with Observations and Inquiries Thereupon</hi> (London: Martyn and Allestry, 1665), pl. 34 (first pointed out in Charles Singer, “The First English Microscopist: Robert Hooke,” <hi rend="i">Endeavour</hi> 14 [1955]: 12-18). Perhaps Blake associated the segmentation of the flea’s exoskeleton, clearly evident in Hooke’s illustration, with physiognomic and phrenological divisions of the face and head. Many of the Visionary Heads show the influence of those two pseudosciences. In his text, Hooke states that he “perceiv’d him [the flea] to slip in and out” his “tongue or sucker” (211). In the drawing reproduced here, Blake pictures an extended tongue just above the nail or claw on the figure’s extended forefinger. Tongues are also clearly represented in the Tate’s pencil drawing and tempera painting. The spiny fins or wings on the creature’s back, present only in this full-length sketch, may be Blake’s elaboration of the “sharp pinns, shap’d almost like Porcupine’s Quills, or bright conical Steel-bodkins” (Hooke 210) growing from a flea’s scales; they also recall the bat-like wings distinguishing several of the evil characters in Blake’s own designs, including the personification of Death in <hi rend="i">Death Pursuing the Soul through the Avenues of Life</hi>, an 1805 illustration to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> (Butlin #635), Satan in the c. 1805-06 watercolor illustrations to the Book of Job (Butlin #550.3) and in pl. 21 of <hi rend="i">For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise</hi> (c. 1820), and the Spectres in pls. 6, 30, 37, and 39 of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (c. 1804-20). The suggestion of bat wings on the flea leads us back to another blood-sucking animal, “the <hi rend="i">vampire</hi> [bat] or <hi rend="i">spectre</hi> of Guiana” described and pictured in John Gabriel Stedman, <hi rend="i">Narrative, of a Five Years’ Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</hi> (London: J. Johnson and J. Edwards, 1796), a book Blake knew well and for which he engraved 16 pls. (quotation from 2: 142 and see the facing pl. 57 engraved by Anker Smith). The bat wings in Blake’s designs were probably influenced by the “bat of monstrous size” (2: 142) that attacked Stedman—see Geoffrey Keynes, “Blake’s Spectre,” <hi rend="i">The Book Collector</hi> 28.1 (spring 1979): 60-66.<lb/><lb/>
In his <hi rend="i">Treatise</hi>, Varley claims that “the Flea told him [Blake] that all fleas were inhabited by the souls of such men, as were by nature blood-thirsty to excess, and were therefore providentially confined to the size and form of insects” (55). This comment suggests a thematic connection between a flea’s dining habits and Blake’s criticism of blood sacrifice and vengeance in late works such as <hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi> (1822). In that text, the “ghost” or spirit of Abel “Cries for Vengeance: Sacrifice on Sacrifice Blood on Blood,” while Satan demands “Human Blood &amp; not the blood of Bulls” (E 272). The anthropomorphized <hi rend="i">Ghost of a Flea</hi> is a pictorial embodiment of the “blood-thirsty” aspect of fallen human consciousness as much as the spiritual from of an insect. My comments here take Blake’s fleas more seriously than does Keynes, who suggests that Blake had “his own tongue in his cheek” when he conjured up the vision for Varley—see Keynes, <hi rend="i">Blake Studies</hi>, 2<hi rend="s">nd</hi> ed. (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1971) 134.</figDesc>

            <p><hi rend="i">Nineteen Watercolors Illustrating Robert Blair’s</hi> The Grave. Sold Feb. or March by Libby Howie, the London art dealer, to Marburg BVI, a Swiss corporation, for £6 million. Export was stopped until 30 May 2005 by the British Arts Minister, Estelle Morris, acting on a recommendation of the Reviewing Committee, with a possible extension to 30 Sept. 2005, and with a valuation of £8.8 million placed on the watercolors (see the Reviewing Committee report, meeting of 16 March 2005, at &lt;http://213.225.138.141/resources/assets//R/revcom_case043_note_doc_6927_ doc&gt;). The export ban was extended (see &lt;http://www.mla.gov.uk/resources/assets//R/Reviewing_Committee_report_2004_ 5_8704.pdf&gt;, case 29), but since no British purchaser stepped forward, an export license was issued and, as far as I can determine, the watercolors were sent to Switzerland by the end of 2005. I suspect, however, that “Marburg BVI” is a front for a private collector, not necessarily of Swiss nationality.

            <head>3. <hi rend="i">Satan Going To and Fro in the Earth, and Another Figure.</hi></head>
            <figDesc>Pencil, sheet 28.3 × 21.0 cm., datable to the mid-1820s. Not in Butlin; not recorded until its appearance in the auction cat., CL, 17 Nov., #4. The standing figure seen from the back includes alternative positions for his left arm, raised and lowered, and perhaps two views of his head, one from the back and one turned to the right. The Christie’s cat. suggests that the main figure is related to the back view of Satan in the marginal design above the central image of the pl. numbered 4 in the Job engravings, and to the similar figure in one of the Dante watercolors, <hi rend="i">The Schismatics and Sowers of Discord</hi> (Butlin #812.57). This may indeed be true, but there are notable differences between this pencil “Satan” and the Job and Dante versions. The sketch lacks large, raised, and bat-like wings—the most striking feature of the other two versions. In the Job engraving, Satan holds a large sword in his left hand, pointing downward and with its tip touching the arc (the rim of the earth?) on which the figure stands. The Dante watercolor shows him holding a very similar sword in his right hand, raised above his head on a diagonal descending slightly from right to left. The figure in this sketch holds a shaft—presumably of a spear—in his right hand rather than a sword. He wears a helmet, or some sort of complex headgear; the Dante figure has curly hair, while the Job figure is bald. The object, probably part of a cloak, descending over his right shoulder and reaching to the right of his upper right leg is also unique to this drawing. In another related pencil sketch, <hi rend="i">A Devil Holding a Sword</hi> (Butlin #824), the wingless figure holds a prominent sword, pointing downward, in his right hand.<lb/><lb/>
Blake seems to have been experimenting with alternative versions of this satanic composition in the 1820s, a composition that hints at Henry Fuseli’s influence. The back view of a heroically proportioned male nude (or semi-nude) recalls his “Fertilization of Egypt,” engraved by Blake for Erasmus Darwin’s <hi rend="i">The Botanic Garden</hi> (1791), and the titular figure in “Satan Rousing His Legions,” engraved by Peltro Tomkins and published in an 1805 edition of Milton’s <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost.</hi> The figure wears a helmet in the latter. In “Satan Encountering Death at Hell’s Gate, Sin Interposing,” engraved by James Neagle after Fuseli for F. J. Du Roveray’s 1802 edition of <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>, Satan is nude except for a cloak, wears an elaborate helmet, and holds the shaft of a spear in his raised right hand (for an etched proof, see illus. 9).<lb/><lb/>
The sketch (upper left) of a man with a bushy mustache and flame-like hair may portray another devil figure. Christie’s cataloguer interestingly describes this fellow as “a piratical looking man with drooping moustache and a mass of upstanding hair, perhaps an invention akin to Blake’s Visionary Heads.” Photo courtesy of Christie’s London.</figDesc>

                <figDesc>First title page, approx. 18.0 × 11.5 cm. The text in letterpress, the design an intaglio engraving printed in brown ink. Essick collection. For the previously unrecorded reprinting of a pl. by Blake in this volume, see illus. 5. The unillustrated second title page, also printed in letterpress, has a different typography and format, but the same verbal content. The unsigned design on this first title page is attributed to Thomas Stothard in Coxhead 38. The volume contains only the 2 title pages and 64 engravings on the rectos of 64 leaves. All the pls. are probably reprinted from earlier publications; 8 of the 12 pls. after Stothard were first published in Thomas Townshend, <hi rend="i">Poems</hi>, 1796.</figDesc>

                <figDesc>Image 16.5 × 11.4 cm., platemark 19.9 × 14.4 cm., untrimmed leaf 24.4 × 16.6 cm. Essick collection. First published in <hi rend="i">Bellamy’s Picturesque Magazine</hi>, vol. 1, 1793, this impression reprinted in <hi rend="i">The Cabinet of the Arts</hi>, 1799 (see illus. 4 and the caption thereto). Printed on wove paper with part of a watermark, “J Wha / 17” (fragments on other leaves indicate that the full mark is “J Whatman / 1794”). The st. of the pl., including the imprint, is identical to the earlier publication. Impressions in the 1793 volume are on larger (28.2 × 22.5 cm., untrimmed) sheets of a softer wove paper with a rougher texture. These differences in paper indicate that the impressions in <hi rend="i">The Cabinet of the Arts</hi> are not remainders from the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> printing but new pulls from the copperplate. The attribution of the pl. to William Blake, artist and poet, has been questioned, but it has been accepted by most authorities (for a summary of the arguments, see <hi rend="i">BBS</hi> 192-93). <hi rend="i">BB</hi> and <hi rend="i">BBS</hi> list only 3 traced copies of the 1793 <hi rend="i">Magazine.</hi> The <hi rend="i">Cabinet</hi> contains one further pl. first published in the magazine, “French Revolution,” engraved by Charles Grignion after another design by Ryley. The reprinting of Blake’s pl. in <hi rend="i">The Cabinet of the Arts</hi> has not been previously recorded.</figDesc>

The ed. cut up by Blake and used, in part, as the inset texts for his watercolor illus. to Gray’s poems (Butlin #335). Some of the materials not used by Blake in his illus., including the 7 pls., “A Short Account of the Life and Writings of Mr. Gray,” “The Tears of Genius: An Ode to the Memory of Mr. Gray,” and the notes on the poems were almost certainly known to Blake and may have had some influence on his designs. For example, 3 of the pls. feature lyres and 1 pictures a Welsh harp. Both symbolic motifs appear prominently in Blake’s designs.

              <head>6. George Cumberland.</head>
              <figDesc><hi rend="i">Portrait of Catherine Blake</hi>(?), c. 1783-85(?). Pen and ink, black and gray wash, 21.5 × 17.8 cm. on a sheet of wove paper without watermark, 23.1 × 17.8 cm. Pasted to a sheet of gray laid paper without watermark, 23.7 × 18.0 cm., this mount inscribed on the verso in pencil, “64.” Loose in an old mat, the cover (window) mat inscribed on the inside in pencil, “M<hi rend="s">rs.</hi> Blake by George Cumberland” and “10,” in an unidentified hand. Not previously reproduced or recorded. Essick collection.<lb/><lb/>
David Bindman is confident that this drawing is indeed by Cumberland and that the subject is William Blake’s wife, Catherine. The evidence for authorship is primarily stylistic and, in my view, reasonably certain. The identification of the figure is less solid, but not devoid of supporting evidence. Another drawing of Catherine, tentatively attributed to Cumberland, is described and reproduced in <hi rend="i">The Complete Portraiture of William &amp; Catherine Blake</hi>, with an Essay and an Iconography by Geoffrey Keynes (London: Trianon P for the William Blake Trust, 1977) 149-50 and pl. ii (now Keynes Collection, Fitzwilliam Museum, accession no. PD. 189-1985). This pencil and wash drawing shows a female figure wearing a bonnet, sitting in a chair, and warming one foot, and perhaps her hands, at a fire. Keynes dates this work to c. 1785; the figure in the drawing reproduced here appears to be about the same age. One facial feature, the very sharp nose, suggests that these 2 drawings portray the same person. Although the lower portion of the woman’s face is covered by her hand (and perhaps a partly extended finger) in the newly discovered drawing, her upper lip seems to project outward, perhaps the result of an overbite. Her upper lip is full and slightly projected beyond the lower in the Fitzwilliam drawing. The narrowed eyes and overall pensive expression are also similar, even though the woman in the Keynes drawing is not reading.<lb/><lb/>
When Catherine married William Blake in Aug. 1782, she may have been illiterate (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 27-28 and Alexander Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi> [London: Macmillan, 1863] 1: 37-38). Her husband helped her acquire “the useful arts of reading and writing” (Gilchrist 1: 38), and thus by c. 1783-85 she was probably capable of reading, as in the present drawing. Her text may be a newspaper, although the way the sheet seems to loop over at the top suggests it may be galley proofs or a very large broadside. To indulge in a bit of pure speculation, might Catherine be proofreading the galleys of her husband’s <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> (1783)?<lb/><lb/>
The history of this drawing lends circumstantial support to the notion that it is a portrait of Catherine Blake. According to information supplied by Bindman and William Drummond, the London art dealer from whom I acquired the drawing, this work has long been associated with Thomas Stothard’s pencil sketch of Blake (see illus. 10). Both were once part of an album of drawings (and perhaps letters) put together by a member or members of the Cumberland family. The number (64) on the back of the mounting sheet of this drawing and the number on the recto of the William Blake portrait (84) appear to have been made with the same pencil by the same hand; perhaps these numbers represent their respective positions in such an album. The inscriptions on the William Blake portrait (see the caption to illus. 10) also associate it with the Cumberland family. At least the 2 portraits were acquired by Sidney Sabin by 1970 (see Keynes, <hi rend="i">Complete Portraiture</hi> 118, provenance of the Stothard sketch of William Blake). Sabin was at that time associated with Sabin Galleries Ltd., the London art dealer. After Sabin’s death, Drummond acquired the 2 portraits early in this century.</figDesc>

              <figDesc>Wood-engraved title page for William Cullen Bryant, <hi rend="i">Thanatopsis</hi> (New York and Boston: H. M. Caldwell Co., n.d.). 11.9 × 9.4 cm. Essick collection. A colophon on the verso of the letterpress title page states that the book was “entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by G. P. Putnam’s Sons.” This Caldwell ed. is probably a reprint of the 1874 Putnam ed. In an undated ed. (but possibly 1<hi rend="s">st</hi> ed. with Linton’s illus.?), “G. P. Putnam’s Sons: New York” is printed in letterpress below the wood-engraved title design. The same letterpress below the block appears in <hi rend="i">Bryant’s First and Last Poems: I. Thanatopsis, II. The Flood of Years. Illustrated by W. J. Linton</hi> (New York: Putnam, “1878-9”). In all 4 eds., the illustrations are stated to be “designed and engraved by W. J. Linton” with “indebtedness acknowledged to David Scott and William Blake . . .” (unnumbered page following the wood-engraved title). For unexplained reasons, Linton’s illustrations for “Thanatopsis” are dated to 1879 in F. B. Smith, <hi rend="i">Radical Artisan: William James Linton 1812-97</hi> (Manchester: Manchester UP, 1973) 190.<lb/><lb/>
The image is based on the old man entering the tomb in Blake’s “Death’s Door,” an illustration to Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, engraved by Louis Schiavonetti and first published in 1808. It is unlikely that Linton saw either Blake’s original watercolor, or even his white-line etching, “Deaths Door,” the latter known only in a single impression. Linton has reversed the right/left orientation of Schiavonetti’s engraving, deleted the youth rising above the tomb, and substituted additional stones above the lintel for Blake’s hillock. The design is probably meant as an illustration to the once-famous concluding 5 lines of “Thanatopsis”:
<q>
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night<lb/>
Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustain’d and soothed<lb/>
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,<lb/>
Like one who draws the drapery of his couch<lb/>
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.
</q>
Borrowing from a design originally intended as an illustration for <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> is appropriate because Bryant could “remember reading, at this time [shortly before composing “Thanatopsis,” c. 1811-13], that remarkable poem, Blair’s ‘Grave,’ and dwelling with great pleasure upon its finer passages” (quoted from “An Autobiography of Mr. Bryant’s Early Life” as printed in Parke Godwin, <hi rend="i">A Biography of William Cullen Bryant</hi> [New York: Appleton, 1883] 1:37). Blair’s work was a major influence on Bryant’s, as demonstrated by Charles H. Brown, <hi rend="i">William Cullen Bryant</hi> (New York: Scribner’s, 1971) 59-61.<lb/><lb/>
Linton also executed 2 wood engravings of the full “Death’s Door” design, one (21.9 × 13.8 cm., with top corners rounded, image reversed in relation to Schiavonetti’s engraving) published in <hi rend="i">The Illustrated Exhibitor and Magazine of Art</hi> 1 (1852): 369, and in <hi rend="i">The Ladies’ Drawing Room Book</hi> (London: Cassell, c. 1852). The other (20.9 × 12.1 cm., corners not rounded, image not reversed) was published in <hi rend="i">Thirty Pictures by Deceased British Artists Engraved Expressly for The Art-Union of London by W. J. Linton</hi> ([London?]: n.p., 1860), and in John Jackson and W. A. Chatto, <hi rend="i">A Treatise on Wood Engraving</hi>, 2<hi rend="s">nd</hi> ed. (London: Bohn, 1861).</figDesc>

            <p>W. B. Yeats. Autograph letter signed, 7 pp., to “M<hi rend="s">r</hi> [John] O’Leary,” not dated (1892 or early 1893?), addressed from “3 Blenheim Road, Bedford Park, Chiswick” an containing a reference to “the article in [on?] Blake you sent me” and to “the pending . . . completion of Blake.” Heritage Galleries and Auctioneers, Dallas, 13 April, #25528, illus. color online ($4750). Yeats lived on and off at 3 Blenheim Road between 1887 and 1894. The pending “completion of Blake” is probably a reference either to <hi rend="i">The Works of William Blake</hi>, ed. E. J. Ellis and Yeats, 1893, or (less probably) to <hi rend="i">The Poems of William Blake</hi>, ed. Yeats, 1893. This letter not in <hi rend="i">The Letters of W. B. Yeats</hi>, ed. Allan Wade (London: Hart-Davis, 1954). In a letter of 2 March 1892 to Katharine Tynan, Yeats states that “Blake is getting through the press—about two thirds, and that the most troublesome part, is gone to press and most of it is already in proof.” In another letter to O’Leary, dated by Wade to “early 1893,” Yeats writes that he is “editing a volume of Blake lyrics for <hi rend="i">The Muse’s Library</hi> [i.e., <hi rend="i">The Poems</hi>] and shall get £25 for it. The Blake book [probably the <hi rend="i">Works</hi>] will be ready some time next week I believe.” <hi rend="i">Letters</hi>, ed. Wade, 204, 227.</p>

            <p>W. Blake, <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience</hi> (Boston: Knight &amp; Millet, 1901). Waldo’s Books, July online cat., publisher’s cloth ($39). <hi rend="i">BB</hi> #174A. Bentley lists a “London, 1901” issue (<hi rend="i">BB</hi> #174B), but the identical typography and format of all but the title page shared by <hi rend="i">BB</hi> #174A and <hi rend="i">BB</hi> #176 (London: R. Brimley Johnson, and Guildford: A. C. Curtis, 1901) indicate that #174B repeats the entry for #176. <hi rend="i">BB</hi> dates #176 to “1911,” but its title page is dated “MDCCCCI” (as in K 278 #158).</p>
            <p>W. Blake, <hi rend="i">Poems</hi>, intro. by Alice Meynell (London: Gresham, n.d. [1911?]). EB, May, publisher’s cloth, illus. color (£4.99 to R. Essick). Possibly <hi rend="i">BB</hi> #289A, dated “1911” (#289B is dated “[1927]”). K 286 #181 states that the ed. of “[September 1911]” was published in London by “Blakie and Son Ld.,” measures “15 × 10 cm.,” and was issued as part of the “[Red Letter Library]” (the brackets indicate that this information is not printed in the book). The volume I acquired on EB contains some titles, running heads, and small decorations printed in red; its art nouveau inspired endpaper design of twisting blackberry vines and the gilt-stamped decorations on the spine and front cover suggest a very late 19<hi rend="s">th</hi>- or early 20<hi rend="s">th</hi>-century publication date. However, the book varies in two respects from the description in K: it was published by “The Gresham Publishing Company” and its leaves measure 15.5 × 10.3 cm. Either K is wrong about these two points for the [1911] ed. or my example is an unrecorded issue. What I believe to be the “[1927]” ed. was published in London and Glasgow by “Blackie &amp; Son Limited”; it measures only 13.9 × 8.3 cm. and contains no printing in red. According to the University of Glasgow Archive Services (&lt;http://www.archives.gla.ac.uk&gt;), Gresham was founded in 1898 as a subsidiary of Blackie &amp; Son. Many of the cover and endpaper designs for both firms were designed by Talwin Morris (1865-1911); the (now defunct) web site of Archie MacSporran, the world’s leading authority on the life and works of T. Morris, gave the size of the Red Letter Library eds. as “c 15.5 × 10 cms.” Perhaps the book was published in 1911 under both the Blackie and Gresham imprints. The author of the introduction, Alice Meynell (1847-1922), was a poet and journalist and the mother of Francis Meynell (1891-1975), the founder of the Nonesuch Press in 1923. Several of Geoffrey Keynes’ Blake publications were issued by Nonesuch, beginning with the 3-vol. ed. of <hi rend="i">The Writings of William Blake</hi> in 1925.</p>

The only difference between the 1925 and 1936 issues is a printed slip of paper in the latter, pasted over the publisher’s name, address, and the 1925 date on the title page; the slip names the same publisher, a new address, and the new date of “1936.” Some copies of the 1925 volume have a slip of paper, pasted over the publication information on the title page, giving a new address for the publisher (20 Hart St., as in the 1936 reissue, rather than 1 Bloomsbury St.) and lacking a date of publication.</p>

The illus. are not related to Blake’s. The only copy I’ve seen on the market in the last 35 years. Perhaps the start of World War II disrupted the project and fewer than the 300 copies noted in the colophon were printed.

Not in <hi rend="i">BB</hi> or <hi rend="i">BBS</hi>, although the latter (151) lists an ed. without place of publication or date, tentatively identified as “[?New York. ?1949].” I suspect the undated ed., in gray wrappers and also limited to 25 copies, is earlier and should not be confused with the dated 1949 ed. sold on EB. Yet a 3<hi rend="s">rd</hi> ed., not recorded in <hi rend="i">BB</hi> or <hi rend="i">BBS</hi>, includes the following title page: “William Blake: The Divine Image[.] Printed by Valenti Angelo for the Zamorano-Roxburghe joint meeting, San Francisco 1976.” Angelo printed at least 2 other books containing Blake’s poems: <hi rend="i">A Cradle Song</hi>[,] <hi rend="i">The Divine Image</hi>[,] <hi rend="i">A Dream</hi>[, and] <hi rend="i">Night</hi>, New York, 1949, limited to 125 copies (<hi rend="i">BB</hi> #243); and <hi rend="i">Auguries of Innocence</hi>, Bronxville, New York, 1968, limited to 35 copies (<hi rend="i">BB</hi> #224).

Paolozzi’s <hi rend="i">Newton</hi> sculpture, based on Blake’s large color print of the same title, is known to visitors to the British Library, where a monumental version in bronze stands in the forecourt. Although Blake’s figure of Newton is both beautiful and heroic, most Blake scholars have interpreted the color print as representing the contraction of the human mind into the twin prisons of materialism and abstraction. In contrast, Paolozzi’s sculpture has been understood as an icon of human intellect at one of its most expansive, even triumphant, moments of scientific achievement.

While such proofs offer insights into an engraver’s methods of developing an image, the signatures suggest that this is not a true “working” proof, pulled so that the craftsman can check the progress of his work, but an early state printed in limited numbers for collectors.

                <figDesc><hi rend="i">Portrait of William Blake.</hi> Pencil, 4.5 × 4.0 cm., on a sheet of laid paper, 21.2 × 19.0 cm., with part of a crown watermark. Essick collection. Inscribed in pencil below the image, “Mr Blake Engraver by / Stothard,” in a hand identifiable as George Cumberland’s or possibly that of his son, George Cumberland, Jr. Also inscribed in pencil, top left and sideways, “84” (not pictured), in an unidentified hand. The verso contains 11 figure studies in black ink attributable to Stothard on stylistic grounds. Also on the verso is a bold inscription in brown ink, “T. Stothard R. A,” possibly in the hand of George Cumberland, Jr.<lb/><lb/>
This slight and delicate drawing is the earliest known portrait of Blake. It is dated to c. 1780, when Blake was 23-24 years old, in <hi rend="i">The Complete Portraiture of William &amp; Catherine Blake</hi>, with an Essay and an Iconography by Geoffrey Keynes (London: Trianon P for the William Blake Trust, 1977) 118 and pl. 3. Keynes states that the recto inscription is “probably by Cumberland” and that “the expression” of the profile “is similar to the posthumous drawing by Mrs. Blake of her husband at the age of 28,” illus. by Keynes as his pl. 4. While the two drawings are clearly of the same person only a few years apart in age, I find that Catherine Blake’s portrayal is more serious (even heroic) in expression and more idealized. The naturalistic sketch illustrated here suggests the beginnings of a smile, a self-possessed personality in repose, and a certain sweetness of character.<lb/><lb/>
Stothard, Blake, and a “Mr. Ogleby” went on a sketching tour on the River Medway, probably in Sept. 1780 (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 22-23). If Keynes’ dating is accurate, perhaps this drawing was produced during the trip, Stothard having already used the other side of the sheet for his figure studies. Although not specifically named as a member of that expedition, Cumberland was a good friend of Stothard’s from at least the mid-1770s and went on similar sketching trips c. 1779-81 (see Shelley M. Bennett, <hi rend="i">Thomas Stothard: The Mechanisms of Art Patronage in England circa 1800</hi> [Columbia, Missouri: U of Missouri P, 1988] 3, 11). My tentative attribution of the “Stothard” inscription on the verso to Cumberland’s son is based on its similarity, in both letter forms and ink color, to his inscriptions in an album of his father’s prints he assembled in 1848 for presentation to the publisher Mathew Gutch (now Essick collection).

            <p>P. 65, “Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims,” impression 3P, with most faces and hands lightly tinted in flesh tones. Acquired by Charles Ryskamp no later than 1993 and given by him in 2005 to the Pierpont Morgan Library in memory of Grace Lansing Lambert. Accession #2005.190.</p>
            <p>Pp. 111-22, “George Cumberland’s Card.” For two previously unrecorded impressions, see under Separate Plates and Plates in Series, above.</p>
            <p>P. 194, “M<hi rend="s">rs</hi> Q,” Blake after Villiers, impression 2M, with hand coloring added by Kate Greenaway. Given in 1998 by Charles Ryskamp to the Pierpont Morgan Library in memory of Michael S. Currier. Accession #P1998.36:4.</p>
            <p>Pp. 198-99, “M<hi rend="s">rs</hi> Q.” On 199 I state that the publisher of the plate “was either the J. Barrow who exhibited enamels and miniature portraits in London from 1797 to 1836, or John Barrow, who exhibited portraits at the Society of Artists from 1812 to 1816.” Some years ago, David Worrall offered good evidence that the publisher was the former; see his “The Mob and ‘Mrs Q’: William Blake, William Benbow, and the Context of Regency Radicalism,” <hi rend="i">Blake, Politics, and History</hi>, ed. Jackie DiSalvo, G. A. Rosso, and Christopher Z. Hobson (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998) 169-84. Worrall shows that the miniaturist lived at the same address as that given for the publisher on the plate (“Weston Place, S<hi rend="s">t</hi>. Pancras”), and—more surprisingly—that this John Barrow lived at a later time at Fountain Court, Strand, where Blake lived from 1821 to the end of his life (see Worrall, 180nl). In “‘I also beg Mr Blakes acceptance of my wearing apparel’: The Will of Henry Banes, Landlord of 3 Fountain Court, Strand, and the Last Residence of William and Catherine Blake,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 39.2 (fall 2005): 78-99, Angus Whitehead confirms Worrall’s identification and provides a wealth of information about Barrow and his friendship with Henry Banes, Blake’s brother-in-law and landlord. Banes was very probably instrumental in acquiring the engraving commission for Blake.</p>
            <p>On 198 of the separate plates catalogue, I suggest that, since Blake is not known to have ever used mezzotint, the mezzotint on “M<hi rend="s">rs</hi> Q” may have been added by George Maile, the engraver of the companion print, “Windsor Castle.” As his illus. 9 on p. 95 of his essay, Whitehead reproduces a mezzotint dated 1813 and signed “Drawn &amp; Engraved by J. Barrow.” This opens up the possibility that the mezzotint on “M<hi rend="s">rs</hi> Q” is the work of its publisher, John Barrow, and not Maile.</p>
            <p>Pp. 214-19, “Christ Trampling on Satan,” Butts after Blake. The original copperplate was acquired in 2002 by the Pierpont Morgan Library, the gift of Gertrude Weyhe Dennis, accession #2002.62:1. The gift also included 2 previously unrecorded impressions, accession #2002.62:2, 3. On 218 I speculate that the copperplate may have been in the possession of the New York print and book dealer E. Weyhe between c. 1925, when the plate was sold at auction, and c. 1983. This indeed appears to have been the case, for the Morgan Library catalogue indicates that the plate was owned by Erhard Weyhe, New York, and passed by descent to his daughter, Mrs. Dennis.</p>

        <p>In “A (Self?)

Jeremiah Meyer.” He died in 1789, and thus Blake’s instructor must have been Jeremiah’s son, William, also a miniaturist.</p>

            <title>Building <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>: Composition and Chronology</title>
          </head>
          <byline>By <docAuthor>Aileen <name>Ward</name></docAuthor></byline>
          <p>Of all the puzzles surrounding the dates of Blake’s poems, that of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> seems the most intractable. In the absence of a draft, and with only a few contemporary references whose interpretation itself is problematic, critics and editors have settled for the stretch of time from 1804, the date on the title page, to 1820, the latest watermark in the first four complete copies printed, as the probable limits between which Blake composed, etched, revised and printed the hundred plates of the volume.<ref target="n2" type="note">1</ref> But within these limits there is great disagreement as to the specific years in which Blake actually composed <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi><ref target="n3" type="note">2</ref>—and indeed, exactly what is meant by the composition of any of Blake’s illuminated works. The process includes a number of stages separable from each other by varying lengths of time: initial inspiration, whether verbal or visual; drafts of text, sketches of designs; inscribing more or less finished portions of text and accompanying designs on copper; possible revision; etching the plates; printing, coloring, then arranging and binding the printed pages. Indeed, one of Blake’s descriptions of the process raises doubts about the reliability of any of his reports on the composition of a specific work.<ref target="n4" type="note">3</ref> His apparent references to <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> are too vague to be useful—whether in his 1803 letters to Butts, once alluding to a “long Poem” descriptive of his “Spiritual Acts” during his three years at Felpham, and two months later to “a Sublime Allegory which is now perfectly completed into a Grand Poem” speaking of his “three years trouble,” or in his <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> of 1809, where he refers to a “voluminous” work which he “will, if God please, publish,” or in his <hi rend="i">Public Address</hi> of 1810 mentioning a “Poem concerning my Three years &lt;Herculean&gt; Labours at Felpham,” soon to be published: all these allusions point more clearly to either <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> or <hi rend="i">Milton.</hi><ref target="n5" type="note">4</ref> In fact, his only direct reference to <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> occurs in a letter to George Cumberland of 12 April 1827 mentioning it as “the Last Work” he produced, one copy of which he has “Finishd,” i.e., colored (E 784). Two possible allusions also occur in <hi rend="i">A Vision of the Last Judgment</hi> (1810), where his statement “Imagination is Surrounded by the daughters of Inspiration who in the aggregate are calld Jerusalem” (E 554) sounds remarkably like a description of the title page to <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, while his later reference to Jerusalem as the Emanation of Albion, which he immediately cancels to identify her as the daughter of Albion and Brittannia (E 558), suggests a stage in the composition of the poem before her role was fixed. <note id="n2">1. See the table in G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977; henceforth <hi rend="i">BB</hi>) 226.</note><note id="n3">2. Both Christine Gallant (<hi rend="i">Blake and the Assimilation of Chaos</hi> [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978] 49) and James King (<hi rend="i">William Blake: His Life</hi> [New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1991] 172-74) argue that it was begun even earlier, at Felpham, 1800-03, as Peter Ackroyd also implies (<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> [London: Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995] 174). Ackroyd thinks it was started “at the same time” as Richard Brothers published <hi rend="i">A Description of Jerusalem</hi>, i.e., 1801 (cf. Morton D. Paley, “William Blake, the Prince of the Hebrews, and the Woman Clothed with the Sun,” <hi rend="i">William Blake: Essays in Honour of Sir Geoffrey Keynes</hi>, ed. Morton D. Paley and Michael Phillips [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973] 273).</note><note id="n4">3. “When I am commanded by the Spirits then I write, And the moment I have written, I see the Words fly about the room in all directions[.] It is then published[.]—The Spirits can read and my MS: is of no further use[.]” Henry Crabb Robinson, <hi rend="i">Reminiscences</hi> (1852), in G.

          <p>However, a more precise dating of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> was offered by G. E. Bentley, Jr., in his <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> of 1969 which has since been widely adopted. In 1964 Bentley discovered in an 1807 notebook of George Cumberland’s an isolated entry that “Blake has eng<hi rend="s">d</hi>. 60 Plates of a new Prophecy!” This, he concluded, must refer to <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, since it is the only poem of Blake’s containing sixty plates or more (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 187 and n4). He communicated his discovery to David Erdman, who noted it in his 1964 article on <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> but did not adopt Bentley’s conclusion as to the date in his edition of Blake’s works in 1965 or thereafter—nor did Geoffrey Keynes in his 1966 edition.<ref target="n6" type="note">5</ref> However, in 1977 Bentley extended his argument by specifying thirty-seven “late” plates which for various reasons of internal evidence he believes were added to <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> after 1807,<ref target="n7" type="note">6</ref> leaving some sixty-three as the “early” plates supposedly shown to Cumberland in 1807. Since then, most scholars and editors have followed Bentley’s hypothesis that more than half of the work was completed and etched by the summer of 1807.<ref target="n8" type="note">7</ref><note id="n6">5.

          <p>Yet there are strong reasons for disagreeing with Bentley’s theory. First, there are twenty-six plates containing references to Hand scattered through the poem, which must have been written after Robert Hunt’s devastating review of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> in 1808 (followed by his still crueler notice of Blake’s 1809 Exhibition),<ref target="n9" type="note">8</ref> but of these twenty-six plates only ten are
<pb id="p39-184" n="184"/>
in the group of thirty-seven that Bentley identifies as “later,” i.e., post-1807.<ref target="n10" type="note">9</ref> The other sixteen plates mentioning Hand (in twenty-two separate occurrences) are in the remaining group of sixty-three plates which Bentley would presumably designate as “early” (i.e., 1804-07).<ref target="n11" type="note">10</ref> In addition to these sixteen problematic “early” plates should be added a group of six other “early” plates alluding to events occurring after 1807. Plate 27:25-26 refers to excavations in Paddington in 1811;<ref target="n12" type="note">11</ref> plate 38:6-7 refers to the War of 1812 and the executions of Mexican insurgents in 1811 and 1813 (<hi rend="i">BPAE</hi> 482); plate 40:19-24 describes the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 (<hi rend="i">BPAE</hi> 429); plate 45:25 alludes to the new (1815) Bethlehem Hospital as well as to the Battle of Waterloo (lines 55-56), and includes one of many warnings against taking vengeance on the defeated French (lines 36ff.) (<hi rend="i">BPAE</hi> 469, 466, 470). Plate 68:10ff. contains a song of victory for 1814 or 1815 as well as an allusion to the Russian campaign of 1812 (line 52) like that of plate 86:46.<ref target="n13" type="note">12</ref> Beside these post-1807 allusions, the character of Erin (mentioned seventeen times in twelve different plates)<ref target="n14" type="note">13</ref> symbolizes the new hope for freedom springing up in England with the revival of the cause of Irish independence in the decade of 1810, as Erdman suggests (<hi rend="i">BPAE</hi> 481-84), while the repeated warnings to Albion not to take vengeance on his defeated enemy (<hi rend="i">BPAE</hi> 462, 470) must date from 1815 onward.<ref target="n15" type="note">14</ref> Thus a total of thirty-four or more plates which apparently were written in 1808 and after should be added to Bentley’s group of thirty-seven “later” plates.

          <p>It has been suggested that Blake simply revised many of these sixty etched plates in the years following 1807 to incorporate the thirty-odd references to Hand and post-1807 events.<ref target="n16" type="note">15</ref> But both Robert Essick and Joseph Viscomi, with their expert knowledge of Blake’s printing methods, have described the “extreme difficulty” of making revisions on already etched plates,<ref target="n17" type="note">16</ref> and none of the small number of such revisions which they detect involves the allusions cited above. If it is supposed that Blake revised his text after 1807 by simply discarding already etched plates for new ones, it must be countered that no evidence of such discarded plates survives, and that he was of necessity extremely parsimonious with copper. Almost all of the plates of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (like those of most of the other illuminated works) were etched back-to-back in order to save expense, and it appears he was running out of copper as he completed Chapter IV.<ref target="n18" type="note">17</ref> As for revising previously etched or “early” plates to incorporate the twenty-two lines referring to Hand (to say nothing of all the other post-1807 references), it should be noted that only seven “etched variants” are listed by Bentley, including none of these allusions.<ref target="n19" type="note">18</ref> Moreover, Hand is an integral part of the poem from the beginning: he first appears on the sixtieth line of the text (5:25), and the thirty-seven separate allusions to him are scattered fairly evenly throughout the poem as a whole. Revising the etched plates of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> to incorporate such a number of textual additions after 1807 is thus a virtual impossibility: the “new Prophecy” cannot have been <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, and can therefore only have been <hi rend="i">Milton.</hi><note id="n16">15.

          <p>How then are we to interpret Cumberland’s statement? First the possibility of human error or misunderstanding in one form or another should be admitted. Cumberland may have misremembered sixty for fifty, in which case his statement readily applies to <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, which may well have contained nearly fifty plates in the summer of 1807. Or, since it does not appear from Cumberland’s statement that Blake actually showed him sixty plates of an unnamed “new prophecy” but merely mentioned the figure, he may have simply been referring to intermediate stages of its design. Or the “new prophecy” may have denoted an amorphous state in the evolution of both <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, in which portions of both were mingled.<ref target="n20" type="note">19</ref><note id="n20">19. Bentley, <hi rend="i">BB</hi> 307, suggests the existence in draft of “a poem which comprehended the actions that were later divided between <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>”; Essick and Viscomi (eds., <hi rend="i">Milton a Poem</hi>, Blake’s Illuminated Books, vol. 5 [Princeton: Princeton University Press/Blake Trust; London: Tate Gallery/Blake Trust, 1993] 36) describe “both <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> as a single project” at one point.</note></p>
          <pb id="p39-185" n="185"/>
          <p>But it is also possible that <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> at one time may have contained something like sixty plates, as Bentley himself has thought possible (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 187n4). <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> clearly went through several stages of expansion and contraction during the course of its composition, as reflected in the varying number of plates in the different copies, and one of the early stages apparently included material about the English Civil War (<hi rend="i">BPAE</hi> 423-24), subsequently deleted, which linked it with the Lambeth Prophecies as one more chapter in the history of revolution. Erdman’s speculations on “the missing ten books of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>” (<hi rend="i">BPAE</hi> 423-24) which linger in the background of “the early and late versions,” i.e., the “revolutionary version” and the pacifistic version (<hi rend="i">BPAE</hi> 425-27), suggest that at least a few pages of the early twelve-book form were committed to copper before being erased. In 1845 J. T. Smith recalled that Blake often “rubbed out” already etched plates “to enable him to use them for other subjects.”<ref target="n21" type="note">20</ref> Though he did not describe how these etched plates were erased, presumably an already etched plate could be polished to a clean surface like a new one more readily than it could be revised for corrections or additions.<ref target="n22" type="note">21</ref> If so, this would supply the ten or more pages added to the existing forty-five to fifty pages of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (copies A-C) to make up the mysterious “60.” <note id="n21">20. <hi rend="i">BR</hi> 26n†, and cf.

          <p>One final consideration in the case against the half-finished <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> of 1807 is the date on the title page. How is the date of 1804, inscribed at the bottom of the page, to be understood if the poem was not actually begun until at least 1808? Butlin has commented on Blake’s “habit of pre-dating works unparalleled until its adoption by some of the pioneers of the modern movement,”<ref target="n23" type="note">22</ref> which may well be the case here. In fact, the only reason for taking 1804 as the date at which Blake started work on <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> is simply the date “1804” of the title page, squeezed in above the signature in a cramped space at the bottom of the page, looking almost like an afterthought. The date is not an integral part of the design of the page, as it is so strikingly in the title page of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, or even of the signature itself, as in <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> (“Printed by Will: m Blake : 1793.”), <hi rend="i">The Song of Los, The First Book of Urizen, The Book of Ahania</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The Book of Los.</hi> Instead, the date “1804” is etched in white line, i.e., incised on a large dark area, which could readily be done any time after 1804, if indeed the page as a whole was designed and etched that year rather than in 1808 or 1809 or whenever he did in fact begin <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> The addition of the 1804 date presumably was caused by his desire to link the two poems, as they seem to have been linked in their gestation, or perhaps to tie them both to a significant date in Blake’s life, the rebirth of inspiration following his return from Felpham and his acquittal at his January 1804 trial, or still more the mysterious experience of renewal at the Truchsessian Gallery in October 1804. <note id="n23">22. Martin Butlin, <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi> (London: Tate Gallery, 1978) 27.</note></p>
          <p>To place <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> firmly in the decade of the 1810s sets it in a far more meaningful context of Blake’s life than that of the mid-1800s. It links the poem to the mood of contrition and forgiveness of his last work, as contrasted with the spirit of condemnation and self-justification of the ending of <hi rend="i">Milton.</hi> It also answers the question of what Blake was doing in the years from 1810 to 1818, when he virtually disappeared from the London art world and apparently produced little work of significance compared with that of the decades immediately preceding and following. Only the hundred plates of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, in both its verbal and visual dimensions, fill this puzzling gap in the output of a major artist at the height of his powers. Its record of profound spiritual struggle and triumph in the face of worldly defeat was a labor calling forth all of Blake’s imaginative strength. Seen from this perspective, the composition of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> appears a striking example of what Charles Lamb was the first to describe as the sanity of true genius: as the creative means by which Blake regained his creative wholeness after the crisis of the years preceding 1810.</p>

The last sentence refers, of course, to University College’s great collection of full-sized plaster models of Flaxman’s sculptures, and although Stannus gets some facts about Blake slightly wrong—the Fountain Court apartment consisted of more than one room, and Robinson may have visited less frequently than “often”—the featuring of Blake in such proximity to Robinson in the original<ref target="n30" type="note">7</ref> shows how closely they were associated in the minds of the latter’s friends.

          </head>
          <byline>Reviewed by <docAuthor>Michael <name>Fischer</name></docAuthor></byline>
          <p>In <hi rend="i">Northrop Frye: Religious Visionary and Architect of the Spiritual World</hi>, Robert D. Denham argues that we cannot understand Frye “without considering the ways Frye’s views on religion interpenetrate practically everything he wrote” (2). Denham supports this point with extensive references to Frye’s diaries, notebooks, and letters, as well as his published work. These references document Frye’s deep interest not only in Christianity but also in Buddhism, Taoism, Gnosticism, and Confucianism, not to mention many other forms of thought that detect spiritual influences on the visible world, such as astrology, alchemy, numerology, the Tarot, and even channeling. When Frye put down his Blake or Milton, he picked up his Herbert B. Greenhouse (<hi rend="i">The Astral Journey</hi>) or Guy Lyon Playfair and Scott Hill (<hi rend="i">The Cycles of Heaven: Cosmic Forces and What They Are Doing to You</hi>).</p>
          <p>Frye served as an ordained minister in the United Church of Canada for 55 years. In one of his later notebooks, he describes himself as “an architect of the spiritual world” (qtd. Denham 3), adding, “I’m no evangelist or revivalist preacher, but I’d like to help out in a trend to make religion interesting and attractive to many people of good will who will have nothing to do with it now” (qtd. Denham 13). Denham shows how religion infuses everything that defines Frye as a critic: his critical vocabulary, his schematic thinking, his ongoing concern with such issues as vision, redemption, and inner growth, even his allegiance to Blake—according to Denham, “a deeply religious poet” (3) whom Frye often acknowledges as the source of his critical ideas. In Denham’s view, religion was not just important to Frye, it was “central to practically everything Frye wrote, the foundation on which he built the massive superstructure that was his life’s work” (3).</p>
          <p>No one can deny Frye’s lifelong engagement with religious thought, at least not after Denham’s painstaking research. Nevertheless, despite my considerable interest in the materials that Denham so thoroughly analyzes, I would still place greater emphasis on the role of literature in Frye’s thought than does Denham. I see Frye as a critic defending the autonomy of literature and the other arts throughout his published work. His strictures against value judgments in criticism in the <hi rend="i">Anatomy</hi>, for example, argue against tethering literature to external expectations. According to Frye, standards of taste, established canons, and privileged artistic models reinstate social biases; they limit the imaginative freedom that Frye wants to encourage. Commenting in the <hi rend="i">Anatomy</hi> on how modern critical fashions promote some writers while demoting others, Frye writes, “we can see that every increase of appreciation has been right, and every decrease wrong”; “criticism,” he continues, “has no business to react against things, but should show a steady advance toward undiscriminating catholicity” (25). In literature, he concludes in <hi rend="i">The Critical Path</hi>, “there are no negative visions: all poets are potentially positive contributors to man’s body of vision” (127).</p>
          <p>This commitment to boundless curiosity and open-ended aesthetic exploration informed some of the wide-ranging reading that Denham chronicles, in particular Frye’s fascination with what he affectionately called his “kook books,” or texts that traffic in the paranormal, the occult, and the mystical. As Denham points out, Frye often found imaginative life in texts that had been discredited in other disciplines. What Frye regarded as pseudoscience, bad anthropology, and dubious psychology could still stimulate his imagination. Similarly, as much as Frye respected logic, fact, and evidence, he also welcomed speculation and daring in criticism. As he puts it in one notebook entry, “[C]riticism (which is energetic response to literature) must itself be imaginative, not afraid of humor or paradox, which latter are as essential to poetic truth as accuracy of observation is to botany” (qtd. Denham 191). In that spirit, he loved Frances Yates’ <hi rend="i">The Art of Memory</hi>: “Francis Yates is wonderful,” he writes in his notebook, “the combination of sober documentation and the wildest guesswork is very exhilarating” (qtd. Denham 196).</p>
          <p>Much is at stake in Frye’s commitment to the independence of the imagination. Imaginative writers not only enact human freedom, they keep it alive as a possibility for everyone else. As Frye observes in the <hi rend="i">Anatomy</hi>,
<q>
We live in a world of threefold external compulsion: of compulsion on action, or law; of compulsion on thinking, or fact; of compulsion on feeling, which is the characteristic of all pleasure whether it is produced by the <hi rend="i">Paradiso</hi> or by an ice cream soda. But in the world of imagination a fourth power, which contains morality, beauty, and truth but is never subordinated to them, rises free of all their compulsions. The work of imagination presents us with a vision, not of the personal greatness of the poet, but of something impersonal and far greater: the vision of a decisive act of spiritual freedom, the vision of the recreation of man. (94)
</q>
Pressure to limit the imagination must be resisted because it is always pressure to exempt the status quo from dissent or, what comes to the same thing, to let our fear of change and losing control get the better of our hope.</p>
          <p>According to Frye, the freedom of literature from preestablished external controls applies also to religion, an important historical influence on law, morality, and views of knowledge. As a literary critic, especially in the <hi rend="i">Anatomy</hi>, Frye is more interested in opening literature to limitless possibility than in deriving it from any source outside itself, religion included:
<pb id="p39-188" n="188"/><q>
[I]t is of the essence of imaginative culture that it transcends the limits both of the naturally possible and of the morally acceptable. The argument that there is no room for poets in any human society which is an end in itself remains unanswerable even when the society is the people of God. For religion is also a social institution, and so far as it is one, it imposes limitations on the arts just as a Marxist or Platonic state would do. . . . Religions, in spite of their enlarged perspective, cannot as social institutions <hi rend="i">contain</hi> an art of unlimited hypothesis. The arts in their turn cannot help releasing the powerful acids of satire, realism, ribaldry, and fantasy in their attempt to dissolve all the existential concretions that get in their way. (127)
</q>
Although Frye understands irritation with the restless questioning and endless exploration exemplified by literature and the other arts (“nobody wants a poet in the perfect human state” [<hi rend="i">Anatomy</hi> 128]), he insists that “between religion’s ‘this is’ and poetry’s ‘but suppose <hi rend="i">this</hi> is,’ there must always be some kind of tension” (<hi rend="i">Anatomy</hi> 127-28), lest social institutions harden into ostensibly finished products rather than remain always imperfect works in progress.</p>
          <p>Frye’s unwavering defense of the autonomy of literature, then, is a central emphasis of his writing, expressed most eloquently in the <hi rend="i">Anatomy</hi> (still his most influential book) but resonating throughout his published work. Denham calls attention to a more private, less well-known side of Frye, the voice that we hear in the notebooks and diaries. Here Frye reflects on the restraint that has discomfited some of his critics who seek something more affirmative from literature: “I can’t indefinitely go on saying that literature refuses to affirm or deny the identification of the verbal universe with Christ. Sooner or later . . . I have to come to grips with the total form of human creative power” (qtd. Denham 58). Frye wants to go beyond what he calls “the suspended judgment of the imaginative” (qtd. Denham 125) and find some “existential reality beyond the hypothetical” (qtd. Denham 113), some “resolution of the ‘is’ and the ‘as though’ I’ve circled around since at least the AC [<hi rend="i">Anatomy of Criticism</hi>]” (qtd. Denham 103). Whereas the <hi rend="i">Anatomy</hi> stresses the centripetal interdependence of literary works within the self-contained realm of literature, the notebooks track Frye’s centrifugal movement outward from literary experience toward something else that literature puts us in touch with. Borrowing from Frye, Denham variously calls this “something else” spiritual vision, kerygma, faith, higher consciousness, revelation, the reality of the spiritual world, “the total identity of Word and Spirit” (260), among other terms.</p>
          <p>As Denham notes, Frye had little interest in systematic theology and deep reservations about institutionalized religion, formal religious creeds, and dogmatic assertions of belief. He consequently uses terms like “faith,” “revelation,” and “spiritual vision” metaphorically, by which I mean that the insight suggested by these terms originates in literary experience and retains its imprint. Committed to the independent power of literature, Frye does not start from a religious position that he then finds confirmed or illustrated in literary works. Instead, his cumulative experience of literature leads him to feel that life at some deep intuited level makes sense, that the creativity expressed in literature is somehow reinforced, not in another world or a redemptive future but here and now in this one. Pressed to elaborate, as, for example, when Bill Moyers asked him in an interview “What do you mean by the divine?” Frye makes complex statements like these: “I think that in human terms it means that there is no limit toward the expansion of the mind or of the freedom and liberty of mankind. . . . [T]he feeling that the genuine things you want, like freedom, are inexhaustible and that you never come to the end of them—that’s the beginning of the experience of the divine, for me” (qtd. Denham 56-57). Or as Frye puts it in one of his note-books,
<q><hi rend="i">My</hi> approach to faith turns it into <hi rend="i">gaya scienza</hi>, a joyful wisdom: most of the conventional approaches turn it into a burden of guilt feelings. Critics who distrust me because I don’t seem too worried about inconsistencies . . . can’t tune into this notion of faith as a dancing ballet of intuitions, affirmations, counter-affirmations, “doubts” or retreats from dogma, &amp; a pervading sense of “anything may be ‘true’ or ‘false,’ but whatever it is, the whole pattern has a design and a movement.” (qtd. Denham 104)
</q></p>
          <p>There is a tension, in short, between Frye’s defense of the autonomy of literature in his published works and his sense, expressed in his notebooks, that literary experience leads to some larger revelation. I do not want to overstate this tension. Passages in his published writings recall the spiritual affirmations of the notebooks, such as this comment in <hi rend="i">The Critical Path</hi>:
<q>
Nobody would accept a conception of literature as a mere dictionary or grammar of symbols and images which tells us nothing in itself. Everyone deeply devoted to literature knows that it says something, and says something as a whole, not only in its individual works. In turning from formulated belief to imagination we get glimpses of a concern behind concern, of intuitions of human nature and destiny that have inspired the great religious and revolutionary movements of history. Precisely because its variety is infinite, literature suggests an encyclopaedic range of concern greater than any formulation of concern in religious or political myth can express. (103)
</q>
Just as his published writings occasionally gesture toward some larger vision, the private notebooks keep that vision deliberately suggestive, open-ended, and literary—the vision of someone who describes his principles as “a) the less we believe the better b) nothing should be believed that has to be believed in” (qtd. Denham 262).</p>
          <p>Even as I do not want to make too much of the tension between the public and private Frye, I also do not want to resolve it in favor of Frye’s fidelity to religion, as I think Denham does when he refers to “the religious base of Frye’s thought” (2) or when he claims that Frye’s “religious ideas emerge unmistakably,
<pb id="p39-189" n="189"/>
though often behind a Blakean mask, in <hi rend="i">Fearful Symmetry</hi>” (2). Blake was not so much a mask for Frye as a key source of everything he had to say. As Frye puts it in one of his notebooks, “My Christian position is that of Blake reinforced by Emily Dickinson” (qtd. Denham 262). That is not an ordinary Christian position. I would go so far as to say that Frye inherited from Blake, Dickinson, and other writers a productive tension between asserting and questioning one’s deepest beliefs, or say between commitment and uncertainty, a tension that saved Frye from sterile aestheticism in his literary criticism and from mindless dogmatism in his religious views. Keeping that tension alive may be one of the best ways of carrying on his work.</p>

            </title>
          </head>
          <byline>By <docAuthor>Magnus <name>Ankarsjö</name></docAuthor></byline>
          <p>In one of the minute particulars of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 39.1, “Blake’s Four . . . ‘Zoa’s’?,” Justin Van Kleeck discusses the title page of Blake’s original manuscript of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> Here he more or less claims to be the first to notice the mark indicated in the name of his essay, the “apostrophe” in the word “Zoa’s”. Van Kleeck gives an informative outline of the history of the manuscript and its various editions. The outcome of his account is that no editor or critic has ever commented on the mysterious “symbol” in the title of Blake’s epic poem.</p>
          <p>This is all very well, and the discussion is quite useful, not only for this particular issue but for any other purpose regarding the unconventional history of the <hi rend="i">Zoas</hi> manuscript. But his examination also raises a few questions that are not given completely satisfactory answers, or, in a few cases, they are not analyzed emphatically enough.</p>
          <p>Admittedly, the manuscript of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, and maybe most conspicuously its title page, are not easy issues, in any aspect. I know that very well since I wrote my dissertation, which was subsequently published as a book, <hi rend="i">Bring Me My Arrows of Desire</hi> (Gothenburg: Acta Universitatis Gothoburgensis, 2004), on Blake’s first epic. The immense difficulty can be easily apprehended by indicating my first reaction to Van Kleeck’s article. Quite confidently I thought that if the mark is indeed an apostrophe, there is no doubt about the intention and the reference. Certainly, it is a possessive mark; that goes most excellently with the main theme of the poem, which I have outlined in my thesis. In my reading, <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> is a poem advocating a vision of a utopian existence with complete gender equality in which not only the male but also the female is active. But, as we know, it is a very long and complex poem, and the way to the utopia of Blake’s Eden goes via the eternal battle of the sexes in a fallen world. Hence, quite logically, <hi rend="i">The Four Zoa’s Torments of Love and Jealousy</hi>: a possessive. The only slight problem is that when looking closely once more at the title page one discovers that there is in fact one more word here: the definite article. So I reluctantly had to admit that my very pertinent explanation was no good.</p>
          <p>But is what Van Kleeck labels “apostrophe” really a symbol proper, and not just something added by mistake? He hints at this possibility, but discards this alternative very easily in his discussion. Too easily, in my view. Bearing in mind the physical condition of the manuscript—many of its pages were after all written on top of the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> drawings—and the handling of it over the years, it is a more than likely possibility that the mark actually is a blotch put there by mistake, either by Blake or one of the many people having set their hands on the manuscript during all the years until it was first presented to the public. Perhaps I was the one to do it when scrutinizing the original at the British Museum in 1997, since I cannot remember noticing such a mark? To be serious, this is of course impossible, since Sloss and Wallis’s volume <hi rend="i">The Prophetic Writings of William Blake</hi> appeared already in 1926 and included the title of the poem for the first time transcribed as “The Four Zoa’s”, as Van Kleeck rightly points out (40). Or even more correctly, it was reproduced as early as 1913 in Sampson’s edition, but then not commented on. But my extreme and egocentric example indicates the next to impossible task of determining this issue, which Van Kleeck also indicates in his concluding remarks: “There never may be a way to prove once and for all that Blake deliberately added this mark” (42).</p>
          <p>However, in order to facilitate all kinds of close examination of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> we need to emphasize that the final manuscript in fact consists of two poems: the early <hi rend="i">Vala</hi>, probably abandoned but then revised through many years to the “final” and retitled <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> Therefore, we must keep the two titles clearly apart. The first title, written in 1797, is <hi rend="i">VALA</hi> or <hi rend="i">The Death and Judgement of the Ancient Man a DREAM of Nine Nights.</hi> The second, later, title is <hi rend="i">The Four Zoa[’]s The Torments of Love &amp; Jealousy in The Death and Judgement of Albion the Ancient Man.</hi> As has long been known, the subtitle of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> is a late addition, something which has been pointed out recently both by myself and John B. Pierce in his useful study of the poem, <hi rend="i">Flexible Design</hi> (Montreal: McGill-Queen’s UP, 1998).</p>
          <pb id="p39-190" n="190"/>
          <p>One might think a discussion of a tiny pencil line futile and petty, but it is a notoriously delicate matter. What Van Kleeck does not mention, and what I discovered by chance when separating and then puzzling together the various fragments of the two titles, is that if we look closely beside the mark discussed here there is one short word at the end of the second line of the later title: “in”. As far as I can remember, the editors or commentators of the poem do not discuss or even include this word in their transcriptions. Neither does Van Kleeck mention it, even though he actually highlights exactly this bit by quoting Ellis and Yeats’s rendition of Blake’s second title of the poem (39). If we agree with Van Kleeck’s argumentation, the second, and final, title of the poem should read: <hi rend="i">The Four Zoa’s The Torments of Love &amp; Jealousy in The Death and Judgement of the Ancient Man by William Blake 1797.</hi> In that case, a reasonable and logical amendment according to modern punctuation and standards of the title would be: <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas: The Torments of Love &amp; Jealousy in The Death and Judgement of the Ancient Man.</hi> Whether the title makes good sense with the insertion of the original “in” is another matter.</p>
          <p>However logical to our twenty-first century eyes this title is, we know that Blake in fact used the form “Zoa’s” on his illuminated book plates. The next step, therefore, should be to take a very close look at these plates. Having scrutinized all the instances from <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> mentioned by Van Kleeck, along with several other examples from the reproductions of the original manuscripts, I cannot detect much similarity between these marks and the one on the title page of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> While the title mark slants to the right, the top of the marks on the <hi rend="i">J</hi> and <hi rend="i">M</hi> plates nearly all of them bend the other way, slightly to the left, and the marks are generally thicker. If we use the handy calibration technique available in the <hi rend="i">Blake Archive</hi>, it becomes reasonably evident that none of the apostrophes indicated by Van Kleeck resembles the debated one in the <hi rend="i">Zoas</hi> title. Although the reproductions in the <hi rend="i">Archive</hi> do not provide us with the accuracy of the originals, I believe we can confidently claim that the <hi rend="i">Zoas</hi> mark was not put there by the same hand as the marks in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and <hi rend="i">Milton.</hi> Hence, my contention must be that it is not likely that the mark was deliberately inserted by Blake.</p>
          <p>Even so, the importance of Van Kleeck’s short article should be positively appreciated by Blake scholars. It is a valuable contribution to bring the intricacies of the manuscript of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> to the forefront of the debate. This will inspire us to examine the poem thoroughly again and make us recognize its true values and its crucial position in the Blake oeuvre: as the first locus where Blake uses his extended and refined mythology, which was to be developed into the magnificent splendor of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi></p>

          <byline>By <docAuthor>Justin <name>Van Kleeck</name></docAuthor></byline>
          <p>I would like to begin by thanking Magnus Ankarsjö for responding to my article. Such a discussion as he initiates here, albeit necessarily short in this public forum, is one of the results I hoped for when writing the original piece as a description of my own struggles with this compelling minute particular. Further, I think that Ankarsjö and I generally agree about my main point: no matter how editors interpret the mark or whether they include it in their title for Blake’s work, they should provide some note on it because of its extreme ambiguity. However, I do feel the need to respond to several points that Ankarsjö raises vis-à-vis my discussion and the evidence I cited to support my own interpretation, that the mark likely could be a deliberate apostrophe by Blake.</p>
          <p>First, as a relatively minor issue, Ankarsjö’s attention to the “in” that appears after “Jealousy” in the added subtitle leads to an inaccurate statement. While Ellis and Yeats do exclude the “in” when they record Blake’s added (but then abandoned, in their reading) title, all other editors of the full manuscript text who record the title in some form—Keynes, Sloss and Wallis, Bentley, Erdman, Stevenson, Ostriker, etc.—include the “in”. This word is quite clearly contemporary with the rest of the added pencil text at this place, and I do not find it to be problematic in terms of the full title, including the original subtitle that Blake retained. (The final, full title reads especially well if we include the colon that Ankarsjö adds “according to modern punctuation and standards.”)</p>
          <p>Second, and much more importantly, the basis of Ankarsjö’s observations of the difference between the mark on the manuscript’s title page and apostrophes in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> is highly questionable. However we view the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript as a work, and whichever editorial version of it we use for our own study, we always must remember that it is and will remain a <hi rend="i">manuscript.</hi> For us to compare the appearance of punctuation (?) marks on the manuscript pages with those in Blake’s <hi rend="i">etched</hi>, and then <hi rend="i">printed</hi>, works offers little valuable or reliable evidence. In this case, Blake could have added the mark haphazardly, in a subsequent act of (perhaps hasty) revision, rather than with the deliberateness necessary when composing text on a copperplate. Or, as I will continue to acknowledge with joy at the uncertainty, someone else may have added the mark, deliberately or not. Either way, Blake’s punctuation in the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript long has been one of the most seriously contested and commented-upon aspects of editorial work, a bugbear for the majority or the most liberating feature for a few. Indeed, my own impression was that determining what a specific point “is” turns into an endless game of pin the tail on the ink-dot—in many instances even when Blake is writing most carefully, in his “copperplate” script. As
<pb id="p39-191" n="191"/>
a result, some of the most obvious “dots” end up <hi rend="i">looking</hi> like something far different; this is true even in a number of exclamation points, question marks, and occasionally the tops of colons, which seem to include commas rather than dots per se!<ref target="n32" type="note">1</ref> This pervasive indeterminacy makes using mere appearances frustrating and complicated to say the least. <note id="n32">1. See, for example, manuscript pp. 10 and 37 for exclamation points and question marks; a “reversed-comma” top dot in a colon appears on p. 16. G. E. Bentley, Jr.—with commendable precision—goes so far as to re-produce the first two types of “commas” in the transcription he provides in his facsimile edition.</note></p>
          <p>We experience something quite similar in nearly all of Blake’s printed works, though in these cases the ambiguity results as much from the printing process as from Blake’s methods of composition. His methods of composition for etched and printed works, in and of themselves, make Ankarsjö’s use of visual comparisons even more problematic. After all, Blake composed the text on his copperplates <hi rend="i">in reverse handwriting</hi>—writing not with ink but with stop-out varnish—so that it would print in the normal, readable way. Of course, Blake certainly was skilled enough to write properly when not preparing his copperplates. Nevertheless, his use of reverse handwriting in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> only combines with the possible alterations to Blake’s original marks resulting from the printing process (acid eating into copper, ink adhering to relief surfaces, inked surfaces contacting paper, ink adhering to and drying on paper, etc.) to make straightforward visual comparison an unreliable basis of argumentation.</p>
          <p>Ankarsjö notes that “the title mark [in the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript] slants to the right, the top of the marks on the <hi rend="i">J</hi> and <hi rend="i">M</hi> plates . . . bend the other way slightly to the left.” Interestingly, Ankarsjö’s (accurate) description might suggest a <hi rend="i">reverse apostrophe</hi> on the title page—though I would not try to argue this too far. Regardless, David Erdman observed long ago that the serifs on Blake’s “g” undergo some interesting shifts over an identifiable period, all in clear relation to the act of writing in reverse; he also uses varying serifs to date portions of the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript, which extends the issue beyond etched texts.<ref target="n33" type="note">2</ref> This shifty serif only hints at how Blake’s methods of composition, whether writing normally or in reverse on a plate, can present various kinds of “complexity” when it comes to how a text <hi rend="i">looks.</hi> While the mark in the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> title may not be (and probably is not) a reversed apostrophe, the difference in composition between this text and Blake’s etched texts again makes me question the reliability of visual appearance as a means of determination. I cannot agree with Ankarsjö’s final assertion, that “we can confidently claim that the <hi rend="i">Zoas</hi> mark was not put there by the same hand as the marks in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and <hi rend="i">Milton.</hi>” Without any more compelling evidence than a comparison between two vastly different types of text, the strength of his conclusion seems unwarranted—especially when considered in light of Blake’s tendency to use an apostrophe in the plural: “Zoa’s”. <note id="n33">2. Erdman presents his “‘g’ hypothesis” fully, including the different forms Blake used and their probable dates, in “Dating Blake’s Script: The ‘g’ Hypothesis,” though he had introduced this subject five years earlier in “Suppressed and Altered Passages in Blake’s <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>” (see especially 51-54). He addresses the serif in the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript in “The Binding (et cetera) of <hi rend="i">Vala</hi>” (1968) and in his textual notes to <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> in his edition (see especially <hi rend="i">Complete Poetry and Prose</hi> 817). For further discussion (and complication) of Erdman’s hypothesis, see Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi’s introduction to <hi rend="i">The Early Illuminated Books</hi> (vol. 3 of the Blake Trust facsimiles); Viscomi goes on to discuss likely reasons for the shifting serif in “The Evolution of William Blake’s <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.</hi>”</note></p>
          <p>Again, I appreciate Ankarsjö’s response to my original article, which makes me feel that providing an abbreviated account of the title’s editorial history, various bits of material evidence, and my own interpretation of the mark served its purpose of drawing attention to an easily overlooked manuscript minutia. Opening up another vortex of ambiguity may be the last thing many individuals want or need when it comes to the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript, but, personally, I find only value in pondering over whether Blake called it “The Four Zoas” or “The Four Zoa’s”—after he called it “VALA” and in addition to calling it “VALA”.</p>
