            <title type="main">Mark and Eleanor Martin, the Blakes’ French Fellow Inhabitants at 17 South Molton Street, 1805-21</title>
          </head>
          <byline>BY <docAuthor>ANGUS <name>WHITEHEAD</name></docAuthor><ref target="n0" type="note">*</ref></byline>
          <p>As the first major Paris exhibition of the poet-artist's works in over sixty years has recently taken place,<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> it seems fitting to discuss William and Catherine Blake's sixteen-year association with a Parisian: their landlord at 17 South Molton Street, Mark Martin. In this paper, after a brief discussion of his predecessors, I present new information concerning Martin, his wife, his nationality, and his trade. I also discuss the relationship between the Martins and the Blakes and how the nature of that relationship throws light on the Blakes' seventeen-year residence in South Molton Street (illus. 1-2), a period of Blake's life of which we still know very little.</p> 
          <note id="n0">* For advice and assistance during my research for and writing of this paper, I wish to thank Robert Essick, Ian Chipperfield, Rory Lalwan, Michael Phillips, Mark Crosby, and especially Anne-Laure Robert.</note>

          <p>Mark Martin is at least in name not unfamiliar to Blake scholarship. In April 1830, almost three years after Blake's death, John Linnell recalled: "When I first became acquainted with Mr. Blake he lived in a first floor in South Molton Street and upon his Landlord leaving off business &amp; retiring to France, he moved to Fountain Court Strand, where he died."<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> In 1958 Paul Miner, on the basis of data from early nineteenth-century rate books for the parish of St. George, Hanover Square, first identified "the rate-payer [at 17 South Molton Street] for the period 1803-1821, presumably Blake's landlord," as Mark Martin.<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> Although most subsequent biographers have utilized Miner's discovery, none has expanded upon it. Martin has remained no more than a name, referred to as "Mark Martin," "one Mark Martin," or "a certain Mark Martin."<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> Commenting upon Linnell's recollection, Miner observed that, although Martin appears to have retired to France in 1821, "he seems to have retained ownership of the property; at any rate a 'Mark Martin' continued to pay the rates as late as 1829."<ref target="n5" type="note">5</ref> No subsequent biographer has discussed Martin or identified the business he must have left off in order to retire. Ruthven Todd observed that "it is not known whether the ground floor [of no. 17] was then used commercially as it has been for at least a century."<ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref> However, Peter Ackroyd first suggested that the Blake's two rooms would have been situated "no doubt above some kind of commercial establishment."<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> In this essay I demonstrate that both Miner and Ackroyd were correct.</p>

          <p>However, Miner is mistaken in some details. Martin was not ratepayer (and consequently not landlord) at 17 South Molton Street between 1803 and 1804, when William and Catherine Blake first lodged there; he was their second or perhaps third landlord at this residence. The ratepayer in March 1803 is recorded as John Lytrott,<ref target="n8" type="note">8</ref> and the residential section of <hi rend="i">Holden's Triennial Directory</hi> lists a Captain John Lytrott.<ref target="n9" type="note">9</ref> It is therefore possible that the Blakes initially corresponded with, met, and even lodged briefly with Lytrott between his last appearance in the rate book in March 1803 and his absence therein the following year. Since the Blakes moved in about October 1803,<ref target="n10" type="note">10</ref> Lytrott may have been their landlord (if not necessarily their fellow inhabitant) for a period of up to five and a half months.<ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref></p>

          <note id="n10">10. See Erdman [hereafter E] 737 (letter of 26 Oct. 1803). However, the South Molton Street address on this letter is in fact an insertion by Gilchrist (see Gilchrist 170). A letter of 7 Oct. 1803 suggests that the Blakes had only recently arrived in London (E 736-37).</note>
          <note id="n11">11. Several facts concerning Lytrott's life can be traced. He was baptized in 1763 at St. George's Church, Hanover Square (<hi rend="i">International Genealogical Index</hi> &lt;http://www.familysearch.org&gt;), so was almost certainly born and bred in Mayfair. However, his name and choice of regiment suggest Scottish ancestry. On 19 Dec. 1777 he was commissioned as quartermaster for the first battalion of Major-General John Mackenzie, Lord Macleod's Highlanders, Seventy-Third Regiment, a Scottish regiment raised in response to the outbreak of the American war (see <hi rend="i">A List of the General and Field Officers, As They Rank in the Army</hi> [Dublin: Executors of David Hay, 1780] 148). The Seventy-Third served in southern India and sustained heavy losses at Cuddalore on 13 June 1783. In 1784 Lytrott appears in the army lists as second lieutenant (a commission almost certainly purchased) in the Royal North British Fusiliers, Twenty-First Foot. However, the entry indicates that he was collecting half pay, which suggests that he had retired or was unfit for active service (<hi rend="i">A List of the Officers of the Army... Complete to 1st June 1784</hi> [Dublin: Abraham Bradley King, 1784] 294). Lytrott's listing in a new regiment and on half pay shortly after the battle of Cuddalore, coupled with his later appointment as captain of the Seventh Royal Veterans, a regiment for servicemen unfit for active duty (see below), implies that he was wounded or incapacitated during his service in India.</note>
          <p>On 17 May 1788, after partially retiring from the army, Lytrott married Ann MacDonald at St. George's, Hanover

            Square.<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> A "Mrs MacDonald" and a "Ms MacDonald," probably Ann's daughter (named Christian, a common Scottish female forename in the period), had been ratepayers at 17 South Molton Street since 1786,<ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref> the year in which Alexander MacDonald, Ann's first husband and the previous ratepayer, had died.<ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref> In 1790 Lytrott replaced his wife and stepdaughter as ratepayer and, as we have seen, continued until sometime between March 1803 and March 1804.<ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref> His ceasing to pay rates during this period is probably explained by the fact that on 25 December 1802 he became a captain in the Seventh Royal Veteran Battalion, raised under Major-General Thomas Murray and formed for those men discharged from cavalry and foot guards regiments as good for garrison duties only.

          <p>MacDonald and Lytrott describe themselves in their wills as gentlemen and as resident or formerly resident at South Molton Street. This may suggest that during the residence of both men, and probably since its construction (c. 1755), no. 17 served the purpose for which it was built: to accommodate one household. However, it is also possible that a shopkeeper or lodger may have rented a floor. Nevertheless, from the time that the house was built until the Blakes' arrival, persons of social rank paid the rates. From March 1804 until several decades after the Blakes left, the ratepayers were tradesmen, indicating a social shift in the history of the house.<ref target="n17" type="note">17</ref></p>

          <p>A ratepayer at no. 17 who we can be certain preceded Martin as the Blakes' landlord and fellow inhabitant is William Enoch, who ran a tailor's shop from this address, presumably on the ground floor. Rate-book entries indicate that he assumed the rates as Lytrott ceased paying and in all probability left the premises, i.e. between March 1803 and March 1804. Enoch lived with his wife, Mary Naylor Enoch, and their infant son, William, above the shop.<ref target="n18" type="note">18</ref> In a letter of January 1804, written after his trial for sedition at Chichester, Blake informed William Hayley, "my poor wife has been near the Gate of Death as was supposed by our kind &amp; attentive fellow inhabitant. the young &amp; very amiable Mrs Enoch. who gave my wife all the attention that a daughter could pay to a mother."<ref target="n19" type="note">19</ref> This implies extremely amiable relations between the Blakes and the Enochs, perhaps suggesting that they remained friends after the family left no. 17.<ref target="n20" type="note">20</ref> However, the business appears to have been experiencing difficulties by the closing months of 1804, necessitating the Enochs' departure from the shop and apartment, certainly by March 1805 and perhaps as early as the autumn of 1804. As Mary Enoch had provided aid and solace to Catherine Blake in early 1804, the Blakes may have tried to assist their co-inhabitants at the end of that year as the business went under.</p>

          <p>The change in ratepayer and business proprietor's name from Martin to Martin and Stockham c. 1821 suggests that, as Linnell claimed, Martin retired to France.

          <p>A staymaker made, fitted, and sold stays, essentially a laced underbodice or corset stiffened by the insertion of strips of whalebone (see <corr type="emend">above</corr> illus.). R. Campbell, writing about 1747, observed that
          <q>The Stay-Maker ... ought to be a very polite Tradesman, as he approaches the Ladies so nearly; and possessed of a tolerable Share of Assurance and Command of Temper to approach their delicate Persons in fitting on their Stays, without being moved or put out of Countenance. He is obliged to inviolable Secrecy in many Instances, where he is obliged by Art to mend a crooked Shape, to bolster up a fallen Hip, or distorted Shoulder. ... After the Stays are stitched, and the Bone cut into thin Slices of equal Breadths and the proper Lengths, it is thrust in between the Rows of Stitching: This requires a good deal of Strength, and is by much the nicest Part of Stay Work; there is not above one Man in a Shop who can execute this Work, and he is either Master or Foreman, and has the best Wages. When the Stays are boned, they are loosly [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] sewed together, and carried Home to the Lady to be fitted ....</q>
            <q>This is a Species of the Taylor's Business, and rather the most ingenious Art belonging to the Mechanism of the Needle. The Masters have large Profits when they are paid ....<ref target="n35" type="note">35</ref></q></p>

Joseph Taylor, father of Blake's acquaintance Thomas Taylor the Platonist, was a staymaker at Round Court, St. Martin's-le-Grand (see Louth).</note>
          <p>Martin's shop, like all London shops of the period, probably kept long hours, possibly from 7.00 in the morning until 10.30 in the evening.<ref target="n36" type="note">36</ref> However, such a trade as staymaking in Mayfair was dependent upon the fashion seasons and seasonal work, with a discrepancy between a brisk time of full employment, pressure of too much work, and long hours during the London season from late November to July, and a slack time with little or no work from the end of the London season until late autumn.<ref target="n37" type="note">37</ref> Martin, like Blake, probably chose to trade in Mayfair for a reason, as explained by one of Blake's visitors at South Molton Street, Robert Southey.<ref target="n38" type="note">38</ref> About 1800 Southey wrote:
          <q>There is an imaginary line of demarcation which divides [Westminster and London] from each other. A nobleman would not be found by any accident to live in that part which is properly called the City ... whenever a person says that he lives at the West End of the Town, and consequently he is supposed to make my coat in a better style of fashion: and this opinion is carried so far among the ladies, that if a cap was known to have come from the City, it would be given to

One might draw a parallel between Martin's capricious schedule of work (ebbing and flowing according to the London season) and Blake's experiences as a commercial engraver during a period (post 1804) in which he appears to have been neglected in favor of the "softer" style of engravers such as Caroline Watson.</note>

          <p>As most women wore stays or corsets of some form or another during this period, staymaking was a well-established and popular trade. Martin's business probably thrived particularly during the second half of the Blakes' residence at no. 17, as a change in fashion prompted a renewed demand for stays. In the 1790s many liberals had expressed reservations about the fashion: Anna Laetitia Barbauld condemned stays in her letter "Fashion, A Vision," published in the <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi> in April 1797, describing them as "the most common, and one of the worst instruments of torture, ... a small machine, armed with fish-bone and ribs of steel, wide at top, but extremely small at bottom. ... this detestable invention...."<ref target="n40" type="note">40</ref> Frances Burney, visiting Paris in 1802, incredulously remarked "STAYS? every body has left off even corsets!"<ref target="n41" type="note">41</ref> Rousseau's tomb featured "a number of naked children burning women's whalebone stays."<ref target="n42" type="note">42</ref> Valerie Steele has observed that "throughout its history, the corset was widely perceived as an 'instrument of torture' and a major cause of ill health and even death. ... But the corset also had many positive connotations--of social status, self-discipline, artistry, respectability, beauty, youth, and erotic allure."<ref target="n43" type="note">43</ref> Steele recounts the reemergence of stays as fashionable women's undergarment during the first decade and a half of the nineteenth century:
          <q>After a brief interregnum around 1800, the boned corset not only reappeared but spread throughout society. We might have expected that having once loosened their stays, women would never again wear corsets. Yet they did, in greater numbers than ever before. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, in 1814 and 1815, the fashion for high-waisted "empire" gowns was waning. As the waistline on fashionable dresses began to drop to its normal position, skirts became fuller and boned corsets increasingly reappeared. Already by 1811, a writer for <hi rend="i">The Mirror of the Graces</hi> was predicting a return to tight-lacing, "Deformity once more drawing the steeled boddice [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] upon the bruised ribs." The fashion for neoclassical dress and no stays was regarded, in retrospect, as having been part and parcel of the disorder and promiscuity of the Revolutionary era. For the next century, boned corsets were an essential component of women's fashion.<ref target="n44" type="note">44</ref></q>
          Further evidence of the increasing popularity of stays is revealed by the fact that Martin appears to have experienced competition from another staymaker's shop in South Molton Street from c. 1816 onwards.<ref target="n45" type="note">45</ref></p>

See <hi rend="i">Proceedings of the Old Bailey</hi>: trials of John Williams for "burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of William Brydges," 3 Apr. 1816, ref. t18160403-9, &lt;http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?ref=t18160403-9&gt;. The address of his business is given in <hi rend="i">Pigot &amp; Co.'s Directory</hi> 1823-24 (1823) 593. Brydges's shop, on the same side of the street as Martin's, would have been closer to the fashionable thoroughfare of Oxford Street at the heart of "the greatest Emporium in the known world" (national census [1801], quoted in Porter 123).</note>
          <p>Some indication of the quality of Martin's Mayfair customers survives in the form of a bill (illus. 4) to the recently widowed Lady Augusta Leith, daughter of George, fifth earl of Granard, and widow of the late Lieutenant-General Sir James Leith.<ref target="n46">46</ref> Martin's bill suggests that he produced luxury corsets for the aristocracy and gentry. Numerous other fashionable female and possibly male Westminster residents must also have called at his shop. The three separate transactions may indicate that Lady Leith and her daughter were regular customers.</p>
          <note id="n46">46. See Townend 1488 and Chichester. Sir James Leith of Leith Hall, Aberdeenshire, governor of Barbados and commander of the forces of the Windward and Leeward Islands, died of yellow fever in Barbados on 16 Oct. 1816.

His remains were interred in Westminster Abbey in Mar. 1817.</note>
          <p>At the head of the bill is a copperplate intaglio engraving printed in black ink giving details of Martin's staymaking business.<ref target="n47" type="note">47</ref> The design is not stylistically distinctive, and there is no evidence that Blake ever produced such engraved tradesmen's bills.<ref target="n48" type="note">48</ref> However, it is also possible that Martin may have asked Blake to engrave and print this for him sometime before mid-February 1817. During this period the Blakes may have been glad of even such jobbing work.

              I wish to thank Rory Lalwan for his assistance in tracing this document. It is clear from the bill that Martin had originally made it out for the first two corsets and then erased the original total, added the third purchase, and revised the total. On the verso "Lady Leith" is written in the same hand. Dimity, of which Miss Leith's pair of long corsets was made, is a cotton fabric woven with stripes or checks. Ian Chipperfield, an authority on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century staymaking (see the <hi rend="i">Staymaker</hi> web site &lt;http://www.thestaymaker.co.uk&gt;), has not hitherto encountered references to black corsets in this period. He observes that the color is impractical as the undergarment would show through the outer garments (e-mail, 20 July 2005). However, the color may be connected with Lady Leith's mourning for her husband and the burial of his remains at Westminster Abbey, which took place a few weeks after this purchase. A pair of corsets (as referred to in the bill) means in fact one corset, which was manufactured in two parts, later worn laced together.</figDesc>

          interest. In her definitive history of the corset, Norah Waugh states that
          <q>at the beginning of the nineteenth century the Grecian figure--the natural figure (high rounded breasts, long well-rounded limbs)--was the ideal every woman hoped to attain. Her soft, light muslin dress clung to her body and showed every contour, so all superfluous undergarments which might spoil the silhouette were discarded--among them the boned stay. In France, where the social order had been completely overturned, with consequent loosening of morals and deportment, this fashion was more followed than in England. ... It is significant that in France the old name <hi rend="i">corps</hi> had quite disappeared, and from now on any tight-fitting body garment is known as a "corset", a fashion that was copied in England though the old form "stays" was also retained.<ref target="n49" type="note">49</ref></q>
          In April 1816 Ackermann's <hi rend="i">Repository of Arts</hi> noted:
          <q>We have been favoured with the sight of a new stay, the "corset des Grâces", which we understand has received very distinguished patronage. This stay possesses the double advantage of improving the shape, and conducing towards the preservation of the health; no compression, no pushing the form out of its natural proportions; it allows the most perfect ease and freedom to every motion, while, at the same time, it gives that support to the frame, which delicate women find absolutely necessary.<ref target="n50" type="note">50</ref></q>
          Such evidence suggests that, as the bottom had fallen out of the market for staymakers in the French capital, Martin may have migrated to London, where stays remained fashionable. This may have occurred c. 1800 (perhaps between the Treaty of Amiens of 25 March 1802 and Britain's declaration of war on 18 May 1803), certainly by March 1805, the date of Martin's first appearance in the rate books for no. 17.<ref target="n51" type="note">51</ref> In addition, the bill suggests that Martin's surname, and therefore the name of his business, was pronounced in the French rather than the English manner.<ref target="n52" type="note">52</ref> Finally, the new discovery helpfully supplements Linnell's claim that the reason for the Blakes' leaving South Molton Street was "his Landlord leaving off business &amp; retiring to France." It appears that by the spring of 1821 Martin was returning as well as retiring to France and very probably to Paris, his former residence, if not the city of his birth. </p>

Therefore, it is likely that the stamp was engraved and printed for Martin by a professional writing engraver, such as William Staden Blake.

          <note id="n51">51. According to Chipperfield, before the mid-1790s and after 1815 some London staymakers claimed to be French to attract a high-quality clientele (e-mail, 13 July 2005). However, of the numerous staymakers listed in London directories, few have French surnames. Two exceptions are Mes Dames Harman, 350 Oxford Street, and H. De Cleve, 5 Holywell Street, Strand (<hi rend="i">Pigot &amp; Co.'s Directory</hi> 1823-24 [1823] 222). I have found no evidence of another staymaker with a recognizably French surname trading in Mayfair c. 1790-1830.</note>
          <note id="n52">52. However, evidence from Martin's marriage record suggests that he anglicized his name (see below). If this was the case, his surname may have been pronounced in the English manner.</note>
          <p>At his shop Martin probably employed several assistants to attend customers in the ground-floor front room or to bone and sew stays and corsets in the back room. The basement may also have served as another workshop as well as store-room. Martin may have spent some time away from no. 17, calling upon genteel customers such as Lady Leith for a last fitting before their stays were finished at the shop. His business was just one of the numerous "brilliant and fashionable" shops in South Molton Street and the surrounding Mayfair streets selling luxury items.<ref target="n53" type="note">53</ref> These included John Bruckner, ladies' shoemaker, at no. 52, Heron and Jones, tailors, at no. 58, I. and J.

Perhaps Miss Macdonald was a relative of Ann and Christian MacDonald, wife and stepdaughter of John Lytrott.</note>
          <p>Martin's conducting a staymaker's business may also be pertinent in the light of two examples of Blake's minor verse from the period. Blake makes references to stays in annotations to his copy of volume one of <hi rend="i">The Works of Sir Joshua Reynolds</hi> (1798). On pages xiv-xv of his introductory "Some Account of the Life and Writings of Sir Joshua Reynolds," Edmond Malone quotes Reynolds describing how, on a visit to the Vatican, he was "disappointed and mortified at not finding [him]self enraptured with the works of [Raphael] ...."<ref target="n56" type="note">56</ref> Blake responds:
          <q>I am happy I cannot say that Rafael Ever was from my Earliest Childhood hidden from Me. I saw &amp; I Knew immediately the difference between Rafael &amp; Rubens<lb/>
          <lb/>

          Some look. to find out Patches. Paint.<lb/>
          Bracelets &amp; Stays &amp; Powderd Hair<ref target="n57" type="note">57</ref></q>
          Here Blake appears to be criticizing Reynolds's evident inability to distinguish between Raphael's and Rubens's paintings.<ref target="n58" type="note">58</ref> However, in the fourth discourse, Blake also refers to stays in an annotation signaling approval of Reynolds's criticism of the Venetian school--Titian, but more particularly Paolo
            <pb id="p43-92" n="92"/>
          Veronese and Tintoretto. On page 98 Reynolds states, "it appears, that the principal attention of the Venetian painters, in the opinion of Michael Angelo, seemed to be engrossed by the study of colours, to the neglect of the <hi rend="i">ideal beauty of form</hi> ..."<ref target="n59" type="note">59</ref> On the opposite page, Blake writes:
          <q>If the Venetians Outline was Right his Shadows would destroy it &amp; deform its appearance<lb/>
          <lb/>

          <note id="n60">60. E 651. This annotation appears to have been influenced by two earlier passages in the fourth discourse. On page 90 Reynolds asserts that "Carlo Maratti [thought] that the disposition of drapery was a more difficult art than even that of drawing the human figure ...," to which Blake responds, "I do not believe that Carlo Maratti thought so or that any body can think so. the Drapery is formed alone by the Shape of the Naked [next word cut away in binding]" (E 650). On page 95 Reynolds writes, "Such as suppose that the great style might happily be blended with the ornamental, that the simple, grave and majestick dignity of Raffaelle could unite with the glow and bustle of a Paolo, or Tintoret, are totally mistaken," to which Blake responds, "What can be better Said. on this Subject? but Reynolds contradicts what he says Continually He makes little Concessions, that he may take Great Advantages" (E 651).
          <p>Blake appears to agree with Reynolds's view that trying to ally the Roman ideal form with the Venetian school's emphasis on costume is unsatisfactory. He plainly saw stays as an apposite image for the manipulation of the outline of the human form. It seems clear that he dislikes both stays and Venetian art for their immersion in and preoccupation with transient fashions rather than for any role they might have in idealization of form. Blake's verse satirizes what he considers the artificial, ephemeral, and therefore inferior nature of Venetian painting, and the impossibility of uniting this style with the grand Roman style.</p></note>
          <p>Blake's annotations of Reynolds have been dated c. 1798-1809 by David Erdman.<ref target="n61" type="note">61</ref> This overlaps the period in which the Blakes lived above Martin's staymaker's shop. However, there are problems with Erdman's dating. According to Bentley, "Blake's annotations to Reynolds were probably written at two distinct periods, perhaps first about 1801-2 and second in 1808-9."<ref target="n62" type="note">62</ref> The annotations referring to stays, written in ink at first glance, appear to date from the second period.<ref target="n63" type="note">63</ref> However, those on pages xiv and xv were first written in pencil and then overwritten in ink.<ref target="n64" type="note">64</ref> The underlying pencil may suggest that these annotations were part of the first round that Bentley dates to 1801-02, several years before Blake met Martin in late 1804-early 1805. But the dating of Blake's annotations to Reynolds remains imprecise and inconclusive. It is therefore possibly that both references to stays date from 1805 on. Whether these references date from Blake's period of residence with Martin or not, the perpetual presence of stays, instruments which for Blake hid and distorted the naked female form, may have served as a regular reminder of the "seducing qualities" and "Vulgar Stupidity" of the Venetian school.<ref target="n65" type="65">65</ref></p>

Women in stays or corsets feature in Blake's early engravings of designs by Thomas Stothard and others in the 1780s and early 1790s (see Essick, pls. 30, 32-34, 38, 39, 41, 43, 45, 54, 56, 103). However, in Blake's illuminated works, female figures appear naked (see <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> pl. 3), in transparent and form-revealing clothes (<hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> pl. 2), or in fashionable free-flowing empire gowns (<hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> pls. 2 and 4).

          <p>Writing in 1927 of the Blakes' residence in South Molton Street, Margaret Irwin wondered, "what did the landlady at Number 17 think of 'them first floors'?"<ref target="n66" type="note">66</ref> Commenting upon Linnell's account of the "Landlord leaving off business &amp; retiring to France," Bentley observes that
          <q>it is tempting to speculate whether Martin retired to France because his wife was French, and, if she was, whether Blake was referring to her when he said of his fresco of "The Last Judgment": "I spoiled that--made it darker; it was much finer, but a Frenchwoman here (a fellow lodger) didn't like it."<ref target="n67" type="note">67</ref></q>
          Blake's statement derives from Gilchrist, who commented, "ill-advised, indeed, to alter <hi rend="i">colour</hi> at a fellow lodger and Frenchwoman's suggestion!"</p>

          <p>The "Frenchwoman" may very well have been Martin's wife. A Mark Anthony Martin, widower, married Eleanor Larché, spinster, on Tuesday 20 May 1806 at St. Mary's Church, St. Marylebone Road (illus. 5).<ref target="n68" type="note">68</ref> The church, just two blocks north of Oxford Street, would have been, along with the parish church of St. George, Hanover Square, the nearest place of worship in which the inhabitants of South Molton Street could marry. The name Mark Martin appears rarely in contemporary directories or in the marriage registers of the two local churches. This point, coupled with the fact that this Mark Martin married a woman with a French surname, suggests that he and the Blakes' landlord are one and the same.</p>

            Eleanor Martin, née Larché, have yet to be recovered. William and Catherine Blake may have attended the wedding of their landlord of over a year and participated in the celebrations. To have given her opinion of <hi rend="i">The Last Judgment</hi>, Eleanor Martin must have entered the Blakes' front-room studio, viewed the work, presumably on the wall opposite the fireplace and adjoining no. 16, the only wall large enough to display it,<ref target="n69" type="note">69</ref> and discussed it with her lodger. Eleanor's visit and the fact that her comments prompted the revision of the painting suggest a cordial relationship between the Blakes and the Martins as well as Blake's apparent respect for her opinions.<ref target="n70" type="note">70</ref></p>
          <note id="n69">69. See Whitehead, "New Discoveries" 1: 54.</note>
          <note id="n70">70. Indeed, Eleanor may have had some artistic knowledge: it is likely that Peter Larché, a witness at their wedding, was a nearby gilder at 22 Rathbone Place (see <hi rend="i">Holden's Triennial Directory</hi> 1799 [415]). Interestingly, a William Martin, historical painter, lived at no. 17 in 1831, during the last months of Mark Martin's residence, or soon after his departure (see <hi rend="i">London Gazette</hi> 27 Dec. 1831: 2787, and 23 Aug. 1833: 1585); perhaps he was Martin's son. However, he may have been Norwich-born William Martin (1753-c. 1836), recorded as living in Marylebone in this period (see Fiske).</note>
        <p>Although they were married according to the rites of the Church of England, still a statutory requirement in 1806, Eleanor and her husband appear to have been born in France and may have been of Huguenot descent. While the officiating curate, Benjamin Lawrence, anglicized her surname to Larchey on the marriage certificate, Eleanor retained the French spelling, Larché. In contrast her husband, probably baptized Marc Antoine Martin, seems to have anglicized his name. Among the Blakes' neighbors there appear to have been a number of other French people or individuals of French descent. These included Louis Claude Augarde, a hairdresser and ratepayer at no. 3, E. Blondeel, embroiderer, at no. 52, James Mivart, haircutter and perfumer, at no. 5, Claude Olivier, merchant, at no. 10, L. S. O. Petit, also at no. 10, who about July 1806 composed, published, and sold from his residence <hi rend="i">Observations sur les moyens de perfectionner la tournure des jeunes demoiselles</hi> [<hi rend="i">Observations on the Means of Improving the Shape and Carriage of Young Women</hi>],<ref target="n71" type="note">71</ref> George Parvin, coal merchant, at no. 21, Frederick Fladong, wine merchant, at no. 28, John Periot, gentleman and hotelier, at no. 1, Robert Sabine, haircutter and perfumer, at no. 41, and George Saffery, music teacher, at no. 63.<ref target="n72" type="note">72</ref> As noted above, some years after the Blakes' departure the staymaker Charlotte Lohay, daughter of the artisan painter Ambroise Lohay, succeeded Martin as ratepayer.<ref target="n73" type="note">73</ref></p>

          <note id="n73">73. Catherine Blake, née Boucher, is likely to have been of French Huguenot descent (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>(2) 1-2), and Blake's brother James had been apprenticed to a Huguenot weaver, Gideon Boitoult (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>(2) 11-12). As early as 1780, Blake, along with two fellow artists, was arrested as a suspected French spy near Chatham docks (Bentley, <hi rend="i">Stranger</hi> 58-60). Gilchrist wrote that to Blake in the early 1790s, "the French Revolution was the herald of the millennium, of a new age of light and reason. He courageously donned the famous symbol of liberty and equality--the <hi rend="i">bonnet rouge</hi>--in open day, and philosophically walked the streets with the same on his head" (Gilchrist 81). On 19 Oct. 1801, five months before the signing of the short-lived Peace of Amiens, and while residing in Felpham, Blake had written to John Flaxman observing that Felpham was as near to Paris as to London, and adding "I hope that France &amp; England will henceforth be as One Country and their Arts One ..." (E 718). In 1803-04, during his trial for sedition and as fears of French invasion were growing in England, Blake and his wife were accused of voicing support for Napoleon. Private John Scofield claimed that Catherine said "altho she was but a Woman she wo<hi rend="s">d</hi>. fight as long as she had a Drop of Blood in her--to which the said Blake said, my Dear you wo<hi rend="s">d</hi>. not fight against France--she replied, no, I wo<hi rend="s">d</hi>. fight for Buonaparte as long as I am able" (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>(2) 160). Catherine is also recorded as having expressed pro-French sentiments to George Cumberland, Jr., at South Molton Street: in Apr. 1815, during the Hundred Days and six weeks before the battle of Waterloo, Catherine exclaimed, "if this Country does go to War our K--g ought to loose his head" (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>(2) 320). This remark has been interpreted as indicative of either Catherine's madness or of Blake's influence over her. Perhaps her impassioned utterance should be viewed in the context of the Blakes' having lodged for the past decade in the house of a couple of French descent in a neighborhood with a significance French presence. As such, her remarks might be interpreted as a desire for peaceful coexistence between England and France. Blake advocates peaceful coexistence with France in his annotations to Malone's preface to Reynolds's <hi rend="i">Works</hi> (E 641). A sympathetic reference to France can be found in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, a work composed and created during Blake's residence at no. 17 (see <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 66:15, E 218).</note>
          <pb id="p43-94" n="94"/>
          <p>Blake's facility with languages was noted on more than one occasion. According to Gilchrist, "Blake, who had a natural aptitude for acquiring knowledge, little cultivated in youth, was always willing to apply himself to the vocabulary of a language, for the purpose of reading a great original author. He would declare that he learnt French, sufficient to read it, in a few weeks."<ref target="n74" type="note">74</ref> Bentley observes that "we know nothing else of his French except one use of it about 1808 in his Reynolds marginalia."<ref target="n75">75</ref> On the contents pages of Reynolds's <hi rend="i">Works</hi>, Blake transcribes several lines of Voltaire in French and comments upon them. The subject is Giovanni de Medici, Pope Leo X, the principal patron of Raphael. Hitherto this unique instance of Blake's written use of French has received little attention.

          <p>The findings discussed in this paper suggest a far more differentiated picture of life at South Molton Street over the almost two decades of William and Catherine Blake's residence than has been previously realized. In earlier discussions of the inhabitants of South Molton Street, Mark Martin, "M<hi rend="s">rs</hi> Enoch" and "a Frenchwoman," though said to have been fellow lodgers of the Blakes, were little more than unrelated names. We can now begin to identify these fellow inhabitants, their relationship to one another, and the years they shared no. 17 with the Blakes. We can better imagine the relationships between William and Catherine and a number of their neighbors and fellow inhabitants--those who peopled their domestic universe. I hope that I have suggested how these discoveries enhance our knowledge of the Blakes during the first two decades of the nineteenth century, a period for which records relating to them are virtually nonexistent.</p>

            <p>For the bicentennial of Blake's utterly disastrous 1809 "Exhibition of Paintings in Fresco, Poetical and Historical Inventions," Tate Britain has recreated the show in its room 8, including ten of the original sixteen pictures. Even though considerable energy and intelligence went into the exhibit and the augmented edition of Blake's original <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> published in conjunction with it, the result is no more successful than the original seems to have been in communicating Blake's ideas or persuading an audience that he had discovered the lost secret of painting. Whereas Blake's show took place in mundane rooms above the haberdashery shop operated by his brother, the recreated exhibition has the benefit of the exalted cultural domain of the Tate, and the curators may have hoped that this, together with Blake's greatly improved reputation, might be enough to save the show this time around. But in 1809 all Blake's pictures were present, including the gigantic painting on canvas of <hi rend="i">The Ancient Britons</hi> (the square footage of which probably equaled the rest of the pictures combined), most of the pictures looked the way Blake wanted them to look, and the relevant cultural and political contexts were at hand. The audience decidedly didn't get it then. Now we don't have enough left to figure out what there once was to get.</p>
            <p>Only eleven of the original pictures survive. The show includes all ten that are still in Britain, but some of those that are lost, such as <hi rend="i">The Ancient Britons</hi>, may have been essential to understanding Blake's purposes in mounting the exhibition in the first place. The watercolors in the Tate show are fairly bright and most are bonny, but none of the surviving temperas is in good shape--<hi rend="i">The Spiritual Form of Nelson</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Spiritual</hi>

            <hi rend="i">Form of Pitt</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Bard</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Satan Calling Up His Legions</hi> are so browned and/or otherwise damaged that it is hard to see what is going on in them (though in the case of <hi rend="i">Satan Calling</hi> and at least one lost picture the obscurity may have been a deliberate effect). <hi rend="i">Sir Jeffery Chaucer and the Nine and Twenty Pilgrims on Their Journey to Canterbury</hi> is the most presentable of the original temperas, though it too is in sadly deteriorated condition, so Blake's plan of demonstrating the superiority of the "Ancient Method of Fresco Painting Restored" (E 529) with a group of exemplary and durable pictures is definitely not realized in room 8. The curators have gestured toward the cultural context in 1809 by displaying some other 1809 catalogues and dedicating one wall to a selection of exhibition pictures in oil and watercolor by other artists, but most of them seem to have been chosen because they were available at the Tate, not because they are especially relevant to Blake's show. With the exception of Thomas Stothard's Chaucer painting, the importance of which is discussed below, the pictures that are provided for context merely indicate that Blake's works were far out of the mainstream without giving any clues to why they might have been that way, and the contemporary exhibition catalogues displayed under glass do not reveal very much either.</p>
            <p>The surviving pictures from the 1809 exhibition are arrayed on the remaining three walls, mostly following the order in Blake's <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>, which may have been the sequence in which they were originally displayed. Blank spaces of appropriate dimensions represent lost or absent works, and in some cases related pictures by Blake are nearby: for instance, the Tate's well-preserved tempera of <hi rend="i">The Body of Abel</hi> (c. 1826) stands in for the somewhat less impressive waltercolor of the subject that was actually in the 1809 show (and is now at the Fogg), and the British Museum's handsome watercolor called <hi rend="i">As If an Angel Dropped Down from the Clouds</hi> takes the place of the lost tempera of <hi rend="i">A Spirit Vaulting from a Cloud</hi>. In one case even the original pictures stands in need of supplementation. The conditions for viewing the fragile and profoundly obscure tempera <hi rend="i">Satan Calling Up His Legions</hi> in room 8 are very good, and a great improvement over those at its home in the Victoria and Albert (where as I recall one must view it flat, under glass, directly beneath a skylight). But even in these circumstances little more than darkness is visible. It might have been edifying if this "experiment Picture" had been accompanied by the "more perfect" (E 547) later version of the same subject at Petworth House, which even today is comparatively successful at making the forms subtly apparent.</p>
            <p>One major issue in Blake's original exhibition was the relationship between vision, light, and darkness; these are of course central to Blake's work in general, but many of the pictures

            he exhibited in 1809 prominently thematize light or its absence, as well as explicitly contrasting spiritual and natural vision (at that time a very sore point for Blake, lately stung by the reviews of his <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> illustrations). And though it probably was not quite so impossibly murky in Blake's day, <hi rend="i">Satan's Calling</hi> was always expected to challenge the viewer to appreciate Blake's visions, even when severely deprived of Newtonian light. Darkness was also important in another "experiment Picture" in the 1809 show, <hi rend="i">The Goats</hi>, now lost. Blake explained in his catalogue that it was inspired by an episode in Wilson's <hi rend="i">A Missionary Voyage to the Southern Pacific Ocean</hi> (1799) in which native women dressed in leaves were stripped naked by hungry shipboard goats. The representation "varied from the literal fact, for the sake of picturesque scenery," Blake wrote, and though it was "laboured to a superabundant blackness," he called it to the special attention of the "Artist and Connoisseur" (E 546). The Tate's gallery label suggests that "Blake may have intended the picture as a joke at the expense of the straight-laced [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] missionaries," but while it probably was a joke it probably wasn't aimed at the missionaries, if only because Blake never mentioned them or their laces.<ref target="n82" type="note">1</ref> My guess it that not all the goats of the title are four legged, and that Blake mischievously imagined lecherous artists and connoisseurs jostling each other to peer into the superabundant blackness to glimpse the naked dark-skinned women.<ref target="n83" type="note">2</ref></p>
            <note id="n82">1. In a similar misconstruction, the gallery label for the lost picture <hi rend="i">The Bramins</hi> suggests that Blake's acknowledgement that the "Costume is incorrect" (E 548) refers to the clothing worn by Wilkins, the Englishman who consulted Brahmins in translating the <hi rend="i">Gita</hi>. It is much more likely that Blake erred in representing the garb of the Brahmins.</note>
            <note id="n83">2. For a discussion of a comparable racially charged work by Stothard, see "'Art Delivered': Stothard's <hi rend="i">The Sable Venus</hi> and Blake's <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>," <hi rend="i">Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies</hi> 31.4 (2008): 529-50, in which I suggest that <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> began as an outraged revisionary reconstruction of Stothard's picture and the poem it illustrates.</note>
            <p>But recognizing this gag, if that's what it was, in the middle of the exhibition hardly helps us to understand Blake's purposes in general. Certainly <hi rend="i">The Ancient Britons</hi> and <hi rend="i">Sir Jeffery Chaucer</hi> were not jokes, even if the latter had satiric dimensions, and neither were <hi rend="i">Pitt</hi> and <hi rend="i">Nelson</hi>, though they may have been deeply ironic as heroic portraits. The curators (perhaps inadvertently) provide a potentially helpful clue to understanding Blake's <hi rend="i">Nelson</hi> (1807), in which the pillow behind the martyr's head generates the impression of a saintly--or Christ-like--aura. The painting itself is in the collection of the National Maritime
              <pb id="p43-99" n="99"/>
              Museum and not in the Tate show: it would have been good if it or another such image of Nelson had been available to contextualize Blake's apotheosis of the national hero, which borrows more from Hindu than Christian art.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, Blake's Chaucer picture is supplemented not only by the painting that Blake treats in the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> as its direct rival, Stothard's <hi rend="i">Pilgrimage to Canterbury</hi>, but also the large-scale engraving Blake first published in 1810 as well as the long-delayed engraving by Schiavonetti and Heath after Stothard. All three are clustered in one corner of the context wall, a few steps from Blake's tempera, and for me the close proximity of Blake's picture with these constitutes the most important element of the 2009 exhibition, in part because it suggests a possible motivation for Blake's whole show. I am still pretty much alone in believing that Blake's Chaucer tempera--which is usually thought to have preceded Stothard's 1806-07 picture even though it is dated 1808--was conceived from the start as a riposte to Stothard's <hi rend="i">Pilgrimage</hi>,<ref target="n84" type="note">3</ref> but it may be less controversial to assert that the primary impetus for the 1809 show was to showcase Blake's "fresco" of the pilgrims as the competitor to Stothard's oil painting and also to promote Blake's engraving (just as Cromek's touring exhibitions of Stothard's picture were calculated to promote lucrative sales of the projected engraving after it). Blake's exhibition, an extraordinarily uncharacteristic foray into self-promotion, can be seen as having an unsettled mixture of motivations, at once earnest--he really did want to sell more pictures and engravings to the public at large--and a game, as Chaucer would say, an anxious parody of the sordid promotional hoopla used by Cromek and others to drum up public interest. In order to respond to Cromek's provocations<ref target="n85" type="note">4</ref> it was not enough for Blake to paint and engrave a Chaucer picture of his own, in the same odd format as theirs (though proceeding in the opposite direction)--he also had to mount his own promotional campaign. This scenario might suggest why the promotion was ultimately so incoherent: it seems likely that Blake didn't have his heart in commercial puffery, and that in

            his marketing efforts he therefore adopted raillery, prophecy, and parody by turns as well.</p>

Grant</hi> (West Cornwall, CT: Locust Hill Press, 2002) 100-03.</note>
            <note id="n85">4. In a letter (May 1807) Cromek asks Blake why he detests Stothard's Chaucer painting and invites him to produce "a better" if he doesn't like it; see G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, 2nd ed. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) 241-44.</note>
            <p>The rivalry between the Chaucer pictures may have spurred Blake's exhibition, but rather than presenting only one picture, carrying it from town to town with expensive ballyhoo as Cromek had done, Blake instead brought together an assortment of sixteen works, many of them falling into subject categories popular at the time but rare in Blake's oeuvre. It's hard to tell how many besides the Chaucer picture were really for sale, since several had been borrowed from Thomas Butts, the "experiment Pictures" were probably not saleable, and <hi rend="i">The Ancient Britons</hi> was commissioned by William Owen Pughe. Some might have been throwaway parodies (especially <hi rend="i">The Goats</hi>), and others (<hi rend="i">Pitt</hi>, <hi rend="i">Nelson</hi>) may have been created for the occasion as Blake's ironic alternatives to such dead-celebrity art as Devis's <hi rend="i">Nelson</hi> or West's <hi rend="i">Death of Wolfe</hi>. <hi rend="i">The Bramins</hi> could have been a response to the popular genre depicting interactions between Britons and colonial subjects.</p>
            <p>I am not sure that a fully coherent conception of the exhibition could have been communicated in room 8 by lining up an ideally suggestive array of contextual works or expanding the wall labels to include more of Blake's descriptions, but the new edition of Blake's <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> that accompanies the show does not go as far as it might have to help us either. This handsome quasi-catalogue by Martin Myrone, curator of the show, is for the most part intelligently executed but not very ambitious. Although the introductory chapter efficiently and even-handedly summarizes scholarly opinion about the 1809 exhibition and much more clearly explains its contexts than the 2009 exhibit itself does, there is little attempt to put it all together or go beyond what has been said about the pictures in Butlin's <hi rend="i">Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</hi>. The presentation of the complete text of Blake's catalogue is perfunctory, with informative but uneven notes, and the biographical and glossarial "indexes" at the back are mostly unhelpful and often mysterious. There are good images of the surviving pictures (including the Fogg's <hi rend="i">Cain Fleeing</hi>, which is not in the Tate show); several, especially <hi rend="i">The Bard</hi> and <hi rend="i">Satan Calling</hi>, appear to have been enhanced so that they reveal much more than can now be seen in the actual pictures.</p>

            <p>A NUMBER of critics--Steve Clark, Tristanne Connolly, Wayne Glausser, Mary Lynn Johnson, Mark Lussier, Peter Otto, Stuart Peterfreund, and David Worrall among them--have begun to examine more carefully the received wisdom, wisdom abetted by some of Blake's own proclamations, that he absolutely rejects empiricism for imaginative vision. Others, notably Marsha Schuchard and Keri Davies, E. P. Thompson, and Jon Mee, have explored the historical contexts for his debt to enthusiasm and its religious sects. Green's study intrepidly takes on the task of showing how these two apparently inimical discourses intersect in Blake's early illuminated books and marginalia, arguing that he redefines "experience" by revising each discourse in terms of the other. As he explores these relationships between Enlightenment reasoning and religious intimations of the divine, Green works painstakingly through close readings of texts drawn from both sides of his primary opposition. His tracing of Blake's continued appropriation and transformation of these sources is illuminating, particularly as he repeatedly shows that the sources themselves often reveal the same contradictions between the material and the visionary, the empirical and the spiritual. Thus the project is both complex and important.</p>
            <p>Yet even as a sympathetic reader I find myself irritated--or, better, intermittently frustrated--by two problems that appear tied to the strengths of Green's study. The first is that his choice to organize by pulling together passages from many works in order to examine a node or train of thought necessitates a number of transitions, and that these transitions are not always clearly tied to his main lines of argument. In fact, they seem at times visionary or poetic, as if they catch the contagion of Blake's sources, particularly the contagious metaphors of the enthusiasts, or of what Mee has termed Blake's own bricolage. Section headings and even chapter titles share this impulse, a very understandable one, but they cause some difficulty in following what is in fact a well-organized structure handling complex strands of sub-argument at every stage of its development. Perhaps that hackneyed technique of academic writing, the title or subtitle that moves from the poetic to the pedestrian, would have solved at least part of this problem. The second problem that challenges the reader even more than its intellectual difficulty warrants is that Green uses several of Derrida's later works as models for his argument--in itself a fine thing to do--but is confusingly oblique as he
              <pb id="p43-101" n="101"/>
              brings in this post-structuralist mode of thinking. Of course, this too may be a sort of creative stylistic contagion from his source.</p>
            <p>Instead of centering each stage of his argument upon a particular work by Blake--for example, moving from the early tractates to <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> to <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> and so on through the Urizen books, the latest of the illuminated works he considers--Green chooses a more challenging topical organization, one ultimately better suited to his larger argument but perhaps less well suited for readers trying to locate themselves within the more familiar terrain of a known work of art. He moves from one thematic or philosophical point of "intersection" (9) between Blake's works and those of his "friendly enemies," whether empiricists or visionaries, to another such intersection. Thus there are relatively few sustained readings of a given illuminated work, and critical points about a work may be scattered through different sections or different chapters. The phrase friendly enemies, Green explains, comes directly from a 2000 conference at Essex, Friendly Enemies: Blake and the Enlightenment, and indirectly from Derrida's study <hi rend="i">The Politics of Friendship</hi> (1994, translated 1997)--both conference and study partly inspired by Blake's relationship with William Hayley. The ambiguity of the phrase points to the difficult relationship between self and other that is central to Green's book: the other may be Hayley or Locke or Boehme, or some aspect of their writings, or it may also be the divine. Although Green doesn't mention Levinas, that thinker's influence, as mediated through Derrida, seems apparent throughout. His use of Derrida, central to the formation of his argument, is particularly crucial in framing his analyses of the divine. Yet a more explicit reflection upon how this theoretical framework relates to his carefully historicized project would have been helpful, particularly a consideration of the relationship between deconstructive critique and the late Derrida's search for ethical and religious values.</p>
            <p>As Green's introduction explains, chapters 1-4 explore a "shared experiential impulse" between Blake and both the visionary and the materialist strands of his "multifarious inheritance" (6).
            <figure/>
            Beginning with the materialists, he then turns in chapter 3 to a fuller discussion of how the visionaries share this interest in experience. Chapters 5 and 6 examine how Blake borrows from scientific writing and yet transforms the terms into spiritual "doctrines and meanings" (6). Thus chapter 1 is primarily concerned with Locke, Priestley, and the problems of the caverned self (as described in <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>) as it attempts to relate to an outer world. Following Harry White, Green argues that Blake does not reject empirical thought but redeems it through a recognition of its capacity--if often neglected--for spiritual thought. We should, then, read the praise of empirical thought in the tractates, especially in <hi rend="i">No Natural Religion</hi>, not as a set of assertions to be reduced to logical absurdity that would then prove the visionary alternative, but as a straightforward yet more inclusive definition of experience than that held by most empiricists. To reject empiricism totally, Green argues, "simply replaces one ratio for another" (14). Citing Otto's Derridean or Levinasian assertion that Blake advocates an "openness to alterity ... the call of the other" (18, Green's words), Green proposes that Blake grounds the relationship between self and other on greater openness than Locke's definitions of selfhood allow, yet at the same time builds on Locke as just such an other to be encountered, challenged, and in part transformed. Rejecting neither body nor mind, Blake's version of the caverned man acknowledges that "the quality of impenetrability" in the walls of the cavern "is imposed upon the body by his circumscribed perceptions, rather than inhering in the body itself" (33-34)--a statement that risks confusion as it poises perception between mental interpretation and bodily sense data. A very thoughtful analysis of Priestley's similar attack upon dualism follows. Priestley's own position Green describes as a sort of material pantheism, a pervasive and "localised presence" (37) of the divine.</p>
            <p>Beginning with a fine reading of "The Human Abstract," chapter 2 explores Blake's critique of obscurity and mystery, particularly in representations of the divine. The empiricists he analyzes range from Locke through Burke, Priestley, and Hartley. In contrast to what he sees in chapter 1 as Blake's
              <pb id="p43-102" n="102"/>
            agreement with Priestley, Green argues that Priestley's appeal to the authority of an "Almighty Creator" leads Blake to diverge from him. As he works through discussions of the Poetic Genius of the tractates, Blake's annotations to Swedenborg's <hi rend="i">Divine Love</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, and a sustained reading--one of the few in the study--of <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi> with its fatal tree, he argues for a materialism free from a transcendent mystery that would confirm its significance. Urizen as Enlightenment philosopher cannot integrate the fallen parts of himself and ends by imposing tyranny:
            <q>The empiricists, no less than their opponents, felt the need to contain science and in so doing they ensured that human knowledge could never actualise its redemptive potential: at the end of history, God would still be necessary to restore eternal harmony and to grant immortality to human beings. Blake believed the opposite: redemption could only be attained by human endeavour. ... It is the Poetic Genius which allows human inquiry to proceed from the known to the unknown and the fact that science has resulted in an acquisition of knowledge proves, for Blake, that this Genius exists. (68-69)</q>
            Green then follows with an extremely lucid discussion of whether this Genius as deity is contained within all men or is transcendent or is somehow both. He suggests that this ambiguity
            <q>may ... reflect Blake's unwillingness to fall into another dichotomous trap. Arguing that every man is God removes the need for otherness and seems to not only justify, but also promote the retreat into the self which Blake found so repugnant in Locke. On the other hand, emphasising otherness too much would result in the abstraction of divinity which Blake regarded as such a dangerous element in orthodox religion. (69)</q>
            Instead, Blake may have "envisioned divine power as constituted by the interaction of self and other" (69). Hence his use of giant forms, mythical human figures to embody this interaction and to make it visible, removing mystery and creating "Eternal Delight" (<hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> 4, E 34).</p>
            <p>Chapter 3, "Right Reason and 'Sense Supernaturall,'" broaches Blake's intersections with the visionary enthusiasts as they debate Hobbes over the nature of the body. Pointing to the experiential, materialist elements in Boehme, Muggleton, and the Moravians, and to striking affinities across the empirical/visionary divide, especially between Hobbes and the Muggletonians, Green analyzes relationships between seeing and being seen by God and by more earthly others. "The post-enlightenment stance that Blake shares with Derrida," Green writes, especially
            <q>his sense of the self's relation to an absolute other who is <hi rend="i">every</hi> other ... develops out of a pre-enlightenment inheritance that promotes the opening of mystery and the accessibility of the divine gaze. ... In the alternative genealogy of an open mystery, the other is within reach: the seeing, hearing and holding are reciprocated by the human self, even as it is overwhelmed by brilliance and magnanimity and even though the other always remains changeable, capable of surprise .... (81)</q>
            Not only does he argue for the "onto-theological grounding of Lockean empiricism," but he also finds an "empirical impulse in anti-rational sects which stretches beyond the Muggletonians, through the ... Ranters, and finds its way into the eighteenth-century theosophy of ... the Moravians, ... Swedenborg and Richard Brothers" (88). For example, Muggleton bases salvation in the vision of "the body of God," a "corporeal ... human body" (89-90, Green's words). At the end of the chapter, Green analyzes the contraries in <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> as revisions of both Boehme and Priestley, both the former's alchemical union of light and heat, good and evil, and the latter's particle theories of attraction and repulsion. Cautiously pointing out that Blake may not have deliberately intended to mesh these disparate approaches, Green nevertheless argues that Blake is "able to situate" (99) himself within such binaries.</p>
            <p>In chapter 4, "The Opening Eye," Green pursues the political implications of his topic by placing the revolutionary sexuality of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> in the context of Swedenborgian debates about and Moravian practices of a divine sexuality that is embodied in Christ's relationship to his human worshipers and also in his worshipers' own sexual relationships. Here he builds on the research of Schuchard and Davies that traces Blake's parents' connections to the Moravians and to their "'obsessively graphic depictions of Jesus' battered body, with glorification of his circumcised penis and vaginal side-wound'" (Green 102, quoting Schuchard and Davies). Fascinating as this connection is, most of the chapter explores Blake's complex relationships with Swedenborg, as Green carefully traces through Blake's annotations a mix of approval and disapproval, the latter--he suggests--linked to the political events of the French Revolution. His discussion of Swedenborg's breaking away from the radical politics of continental masonic lodges seems, however, a bit truncated, perhaps as a result of cutting without reinserting some transitional material. His concluding discussion of Richard Brothers, building on work by Morton Paley and Mee, defines itself by emphasizing the "primacy of experience, ... the importance of expanding or altering perception and ... the conjunction between the divine and the human ...the visibilizing of the invisible other, the becoming public of the sacred secret" (129).</p>
            <p>Chapter 5, "The Art of God," takes off from an annotation to Lavater's <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> in which Blake proclaims that "man is either the ark of God or a phantom of the earth &amp; of the water" (533, E 596). Green then explores
            <q>questions of human nature, sexuality, bodily existence and, without perhaps taking things too far, the interiorisation of divine light ... questions not only about the relationship between
              <pb id="p43-103" n="103"/>
              law and desire, but also about the limitations of sexuality, the dangers of perception, and the extent to which the self can or should open itself to the interpenetration of the other. (133-34)</q>
            A discussion of <hi rend="i">For Children: The Gates of Paradise</hi> tests the alternatives for defining "man" that Blake's annotation to Lavater suggests: Green conducts a close examination of these emblematic plates, finding in them both the affirmative aphorism from <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> that "every thing that lives is Holy" and the bleaker view of "life's capacity for living on death" (137). Nevertheless, he argues, that capacity proves liberating, an escape from or at least a passive resistance to Urizen's "iron laws" (E 81).</p>
            <p>A reading of plate 11 of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi>, however, suggests "an anxiety over the actual potential of the Poetic Genius to liberate" us from "cultural and political subjection" (139). Turning to <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>, Green then argues that Oothoon's self-sacrifice to Theotormon's eagles leads toward "a particular understanding of the relationship between suffering and prophecy, between distress and the human experience of the divine" (145). He does admit a few pages later that "somewhat distressingly, the unfolding of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> would seem to suggest that it is through the horror of suffering ... that insight into the heart of the deity can be achieved"--a link between "sexual exploitation and a Promethean politics" (147). If Oothoon is the Promethean figure who resists suffering for human liberty, then how does her willing self-sacrifice work here? Is she a Christ-like scapegoat? Is she compromised by that acceptance of suffering? Does she change her mind in the course of the poem, resisting Urizen far more openly in her final monologue? While Green's reading does have some intriguing affinities with recent discussions of Shelley's Prometheus and the question of his submission to suffering, the discussion is simply too condensed to satisfy the questions of a critic immersed in feminist readings of the work. Instead of discussing Oothoon's attack upon Urizen, which would seem relevant to his discussions of the divine, Green turns back to the "Marygold" (E 45) that she plucks before beginning her dangerous journey toward Theotormon. Following Worrall's suggestion that scientific reports of emitted light from the flower can be linked to spiritual vision, Green argues that Oothoon's conversation with the marigold perceived as nymph moves beyond the limits of science (for Darwin acknowledges that he cannot fully explain that strange light emitted from the flower) into a redemptive vision that images an eroticized divine love. I am still puzzled, though, about how that potential of divine love is realized--or, rather, tested--in the narrative that follows. When Green turns to "the illumination of the final plate" (152), he describes Oothoon wrapped in flames and hovering above the daughters of Albion. While I agree that this may be a visual image of her hope to enlist us in her prophetic vision, Green doesn't note that in some copies the flames are blue-green waves. Nor does he note the interpretative problem posed by the occasional migration of the dark, static frontispiece to the final plate, a migration that points toward a more pessimistic reading.</p>
            <p>A section on the bounding line moves from the graphic toward an exploration of the boundaries between self and other. Following Joseph Viscomi's and other critics' observations that Blake relates artistic and sexual energies, Green adapts Edward Larrissy's claim that a "concern over sexual possessiveness" reflects "an anxiety about form and structure in general" (154, Green's words) to argue that "the relation between artist and medium is intimately connected with the relation between self and other" (155)--and thus to Blake's overarching theme of the divine found in the relationship between self and other. "Sexual possessiveness, the drive to bring the other into oneself," Green writes, "is the very impulse that opens the self to alterity, that renders it hospitable toward the other" (154). This wording is still disturbing, given the rape in <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>, and seems to distort Larrissy's point about Blake's "concern." He goes on, however, to use less aggressive phrasing and to demonstrate the significance of his argument. Citing Blake's December 1795 letter to George Cumberland discussing the relationship among invention, execution, and inspiration, Green explains that the "embrace of alterity in the process of artistic embodiment is meaningfully connected to the idea of the bounding line as well as to Blake's understanding of the self open to redemption, particularly as this relates to the closeted self described by Locke" (156). He then tests this point against Locke's theories of invention, judgment, and genius in <hi rend="i">Thoughts Concerning Education</hi> as well as <hi rend="i">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</hi> to explore issues raised by Locke and later materialists about the invasive, contagious effect of ideas from outside the self, ideas that transform the self's perception and subject it to imprisoning, external moral systems. <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi>, he concludes, dramatizes this problem. A final section of this complex chapter explores further the paradox that in Blake's visionary materialism "absolute interiority ... corresponds with a sense of the self's thoroughgoing permeation by the other, a loving and erotically charged intercourse with the divine that occurs even when the self remains unaware (163). Thus he returns to the Moravians' theology--and also to Derrida's <hi rend="i">Politics of Friendship</hi> and others--and hence, by way of Lavater's aphorisms and theories of physiognomy, back to the visual perception of others. He then goes back to Cumberland's praise of Blake in <hi rend="i">Thoughts on Outline</hi> and develops further the idea of outline as a penetrable barrier between self and an other that may be either human or divine. This sequence, even more dizzying than my summary suggests, leads to a reading of
            <q>the bounding line as an expression of energetic identy rather than as an impediment to interaction and conversation. Therefore, in drawing, both executed and perceived, the barrier is allowed to become the bearer and the expression of identity is united with the differentiation of one self from another. (170)</q></p>
            <pb id="p43-104" n="104"/>
            <p>In his concluding chapter, "The Sublime Act," Green shifts focus slightly to extend the relationship between essential self and the "external form" (171) of that self by developing Viscomi's point that Lavater's <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> and Blake's notes to them generate the early tractate <hi rend="i">All Religions are One</hi>. Green's glosses of Blake's glosses show that Blake reverses Spinoza's priority of divine substance over particular essences; Blake "implies a redefinition of substance as the manifestation of essence--as the ascription of a visible quality, a 'tincture', to the essence," leading to "a public expression of identity" (172). "Tincture" is an artistic term for color yet also a mystical term drawn from Boehme. In making this link, Blake
            <q>is infusing his discussion of artistic and human forms with the idea of a divine fire or energy. Thus, in giving tincture to the accident, the substance effectively redeems the self's relationship with the other, transforming arbitrary imposition into a conflict or convergence of distinct and eternal identities. (173)</q>
            In the tractates, Green argues, the "Poetic Genius ... operates as the nexus linking the universal essence that drives creation with the individual identities that it creates." In the process by which God "becomes as we are" (E 3), "the universal genius becomes possessed by each individual manifestation. ... Thus, the traits of the individual are transferred onto the universal impetus of creation, effecting a mediation between the universal and the personal" (176-77). This is a fine supplement to his earlier discussions of the Poetic Genius.</p>
            <p>In a rich glossing of the Proverb of Hell, "The most sublime act is to set another before you," Green moves from the most obvious meaning, "giving deference to the other," to a reading based on a response to the visual. He turns the visually dangerous process of "becoming what [the observer] beholds," seeing the other placed in front of the subject, into a process of subjecting the self to "infiltration to the potential of interpenetration, of love" (177), and thus to an "influx of the divine" (178). Again, recalling Oothoon, I'm a little nervous about Green's syntax equating interpenetration with love as he shifts from human relationships to human/divine relationships. Still a third shade of meaning, however, points toward a political and religious substitution of the other for the self, leaving the other to bear the brunt of public criticism, to become a scapegoat or sacrifice. Here Green's reading might be further developed in terms of Kenneth Burke's theories of scapegoating--as Laura Rutland has argued in an unpublished dissertation.<ref target="n86" type="note">1</ref> As Green links the crucifixion to more recent scapegoating in the Terror, he returns to Derrida's Levinas-influenced argument that friendship is non-reciprocal, asymmetrical. Thus, he writes, "Christ as the example <hi rend="i">par excellence</hi> of the divine other shatters the foundations of caverned man, of the Lockean self from which we ourselves today continue to inherit" (179).</p>
            <note id="n86">1. "Hindrance, Act, and the Scapegoat: William Blake, Kenneth Burke, and the Rhetoric of Order," diss., University of Tennessee, 2003.</note>
            <p>When Green turns back to <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> to set up his conclusion, I think he misreads Isaiah and Ezekiel by suggesting that they support the "cultural subjugation" of submitting to the "jews code" (E 39) (182-83), but his larger point, as he criticizes Nicholas Williams's reading, is one to weigh seriously: <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi>, and Blake's early work more broadly, possess an "underlying spiritual basis" that is not totalizing, because Blake makes room for "variety in the generation of identity" (184). Finally,
            <q>it is the interplay between substance and accident, variety and unity, that allows for the expression of personal genius. ... It is the lusts and appetites of the human body, which from an angelic or Urizenic perspective are marks of frailty and imperfection, that give shape to human identity and facilitates [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] both the interiorisation and the public expression of that light which is love, by inducing us to seek something beyond the "shadows of [our] curtains" (<hi rend="i">Visions</hi>, 7.7; E50). (189-90)</q></p>
            <p>Although some of the difficulties presented by Green's book might have been avoided by clearer transitions and signals, many others are intrinsic to the very difficult intersections he traces, and thus the struggle to understand his study is well worth the time. Moreover, if his analyses of the relationships between self and other run into problems when one tries to read them in terms of gender differences, these problems may be a result of his highly abstract Derridean/Levinasian argument that relationships with the other, whether human or divine, may all be spoken of in the same way and may all share the same lack of symmetry. In other words, this may be the reader's problem with Green's theoretical model, and not entirely with his use of it. Still, a book so focused on sexuality in early Blake might acknowledge the difficulties that model generates once it is applied to works that have been read so productively from feminist viewpoints.</p>

            <p>WILLIAM Hayley's art collection was sold at Christie's in a single day, 15 February 1821.<ref target="n87" type="note">1</ref> Hayley owned, as one would expect, a number of drawings and sketches by his friends George Romney and John Flaxman, as well as paintings attributed to, among others, Both, Breughel, and Quentin Matsys. Among the 140 numbered lots is one of particular interest to readers of this journal:
            <q>Pamela ...... 106 A pastoral drawing in body colours: and the sun dial by Blake</q>
            The existence of Blake's <hi rend="i">Sun Dial</hi> has been known since the publication of Butlin's great catalogue,<ref target="n88" type="note">2</ref> but the identity of "Pamela" has not been established, nor the means by which Hayley acquired Pamela's "pastoral drawing." These subjects can now be clarified, although Blake's <hi rend="i">Sun Dial</hi> remains untraced.</p>
            <p>Hayley first met Pamela, then aged fourteen, when visiting Paris with Romney (both sympathizers with the young revolution) in 1790. There they were entertained by the celebrated writer on education, Madame de Genlis, who was also governess and tutor to the children of the duc d'Orléans. It was given out that Pamela, so called after Samuel Richardson's heroine, had been born in Newfoundland, that her name had been Nancy Sims, that she had been taken by her mother back to Hampshire after her father's death, and then had been brought to Paris by a British diplomat and introduced into the family of Louis-Philippe, where she was brought up with his children under the governance of Mme. de Genlis. However, many believed that the girl, now called Anne Caroline Stéphanie, was the daugher of Mme. de Genlis and the duke.<ref target="n89" type="note">3</ref> She was evidently a girl of beauty and charm, for Hayley singled her out in the "impromptu" he wrote before he and Romney left Paris:
            <q><hi rend="i">TO MADAME DE GENLIS, AND HER COMPANIONS,</hi><lb/>
            SATURDAY, AUGUST 21, 1790.<lb/>
            <lb/>
            <hi rend="i">So great the favors shewn us here,<lb/>
            Which time can ne'er efface,<lb/>
            Our gratitude can scarce appear<lb/>
            Proportioned to their grace.<lb/>
            <lb/>
            In this distress sure aid I seek,<lb/>
            Dear Pamela, from you,<lb/>
            If those sweet lips will deign to speak<lb/>
            Our thanks, and our adieu!</hi><ref target="n90" type="note">4</ref></q></p>
            <p>In 1791-92 Pamela and her tutor were in England, and Romney accompanied them to the theater many times. In January 1792 the artist began painting two portraits of Pamela. These were never finished, nor was a portrait of Mme. de Genlis begun at the same time.<ref target="n91" type="note">5</ref> Although it appears that Mme. de Genlis did not see Hayley during this visit, they were in correspondence, and she sent him a copy of her <hi rend="i">Leçons d'une gouvernante à ses élèves, ou Fragmens d'un journal, qui a été fait pour l'education des enfans de Monsieur d'Orléans</hi> (Paris, 1791), as Hayley tells his wife, Elizabeth, in a letter dates 19 October 1791.<ref target="n92" type="note">6</ref> This book, Hayley says, "is a detail of all her minute attention to the children," and Pamela plays a role in it, as do the other Orléans children. "She," writes Hayley, "has just had the kindness to send me, with her new publication, a very pretty drawing from the pencil of Pamela, the lovely girl whom she educates with her princely disciples." Although we cannot be sure that this was the "pastoral drawing," it is Hayley's only published mention of receiving a drawing by Pamela, who would shortly have little time for pastoral scenes.</p>

            <p>After returning to Paris in 1792, Pamela attended a performance of Cherubini's opera, <hi rend="i">Lodoïska</hi>, and was seen in a loge by Lord Edward Fitzgerald, who was struck by her beauty. The resulting <hi rend="i">coup de foudre</hi> led to their marrying at Tournai on 27 December 1792, less than a month later. Lady Fitzgerald then went to live with her husband in County Kildare, and became deeply involved in his revolutionary activities. Just prior to the rising of the United Irishmen in 1798, Lord Edward, a leader of the movement, was wounded in a gunfight with the

              authorities and was left to die in prison without medical attention. The crown seized the Fitzgerald estates, and Pamela eventually returned to France, where she lived on a pension from the Orléans family. It must have been a small one, for she died destitute in 1831.</p>
            <p>What the association between Pamela's "pastoral drawing" and "the sun dial by Blake" may be, or even whether there is one, is a matter for speculation. Auction catalogues are not models of scholarship. Presumably there are two separate drawings here, arbitrarily lumped together, although it is possible that Hayley thought that Pamela's landscape needed a sun dial and had Blake draw one into it. The wording of the entry for lot 106 is ambiguous at best. One additional fact is of interest, although for the moment it will lead only to further questions. The Frick Collection library's copy of this catalogue is marked with buyers' names and the prices paid. Lot 106 was bought for nine shillings by "Peacock." Peacock was the buyer of at least two other lots in this sale, numbers 110 and 116. Was he a dealer or a collector? Further investigation may yet lead to the rediscovery of "the sun dial by Blake."</p>

            <p>WILLIAM Blake engraved and etched hundreds of copperplates, but only forty-nine of them are known to have survived.<ref target="n93" type="note">1</ref> The information embedded in the metal of engravings can extend very considerably what we can deduce from prints made from them. However, most of the plates engraved by Blake and his contemporaries have long since been reduced to their constituent copper and converted to shoe buckles and cannon, sheathing for ships and wire. Consequently, the discovery of more is very exciting.</p>
            <note id="n93">1. See "Blake's Heavy Metal: The History, Weight, Uses, Cost, and Makers of His Copper Plates," <hi rend="i">University of Toronto Quarterly</hi> 76.2 (2007): 744; Blake also made seven temperas on copper. His woodblocks for Virgil survive in the British Museum Department of Prints and Drawings, but his only lithographic stone (of Enoch) does not survive.</note>
            <p>The print-making and -selling firm of Thomas Ross Limited in Binfield, Berkshire, has in its archive almost 10,000 copperplates dating from 1720 to the 1990s. These include designs by Flaxman, Hogarth, Linnell, and Stothard, but "the plates by William Blake ... are the most valuable in the Collection."<ref target="n94" type="note">2</ref></p>
            <note id="n94">2. "First Impressions: Blake and Turner are just two of the artists in the Thomas Ross Collection. RM Healey pays a visit," <hi rend="i">Rare Book Review</hi> (April-May 2007): 50-53. Healey does not identify the Blake plates in the archive.</note>
            <p>The firm is descended from John Dixon, who printed proofs of Blake's <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of Job</hi> on 3-4 March 1825,<ref target="n95" type="note">3</ref> and from Dixon &amp; Ross, who printed twenty-five sets of Blake's seven Dante engravings on 26 September 1838.<ref target="n96" type="note">4</ref> Over the next 170 years it acquired the stock of printers and publishers, generally without plate inventories, including the major firms of McQueen (founded c. 1700), acquired in the 1960s) and Mauroo (founded 1900, acquired in 2000 with a stock of 2,600 plates). The business was acquired about thirty years ago by the Nutbrown family. They keep over half of their stock in print (listed at &lt;http://www.thomasross.co.uk&gt;), chiefly sailing, hunting, sporting, genre, and architectural scenes sold directly to galleries, framers, and interior designers rather than at retail. Though the Blake copperplates, twenty-six in all, are said to be the most valuable in the collection, only the Canterbury Pilgrims plate is kept in print, and Mr. Lindsay Nutbrown tells me that they sell only three or four of them a year. The others have not been printed in living memory.</p>

            <p>As only the Canterbury Pilgrims plate is identified on the Ross web site, Nutbrown generously described the Blakes for me. They consist of the Canterbury Pilgrims plate, the twenty-two plates for Blake's <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of Job</hi>, the portrait of Blake engraved after Thomas Phillips by Louis Schiavonetti as the frontispiece to Blair's <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> (1808), a double plate of Blake and Catherine drawn by Frederick J. Shields after outlines by Blake, and a portrait of Catherine. The dimensions of the plates (given as height x width in cm.) are very significant:

            <p>The dimensions indicate that the plates of Job, the Canterbury Pilgrims, and the Phillips-Schiavonetti portrait are reduced-size facsimiles of the originals which happen to survive elsewhere. Blake's Job copperplates were commissioned (1823) and published (1826) by John Linnell, whose grandson Herbert Linnell gave them to the British Museum Department of Prints and Drawings in 1919 (<hi rend="i">BB</hi> #421). The Canterbury Pilgrims plate (1810) is now in the Yale University Art Gallery. Blake's twelve plates for Blair's <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> and the frontispiece portrait of him by Phillips were commissioned by Robert Hartley Cromek, engraved by Schiavonetti, and published in 1808, 1813, [1870], and 1926; the Blair designs were reprinted in Mora's <hi rend="i">Meditaciones Poeticas</hi> (1826) (<hi rend="i">BB</hi> #484). The copperplates were acquired by Lessing J. Rosenwald in 1938 and given to the National Gallery of Art (<hi rend="i">BB</hi> #435).</p>
            <p>Probably some of the Ross plates were made for the second edition of Gilchrist's <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi> (1880)--no longer "pictor ignotus" as in 1863. The dimensions are similar or identical to those in the 1880 edition:

            <p>The Job prints are more problematical. When they were first printed in Gilchrist (1863, vol. 2), they show no intended platemark (in the Victoria University copy), and the only measurements feasible are of the framing lines, which do not include the imprint. When the prints appeared in 1880 (vol. 2), they are on India paper showing clear platemarks with four rounded corners (in the Victoria University copy). The dimensions of the framing lines are significantly larger in 1863 than in 1880:

            <p>In the list of illustrations, the 1863 Job prints are called photo-lithographs, and lithographs would leave no platemarks. The superior 1880 prints are said to be "Photo-Intaglios" produced by the Typographic Etching Company.<ref target="n97" type="note">5</ref></p>

            <p>I conclude that the three Ross portraits of the Blakes almost certainly were those made for the second edition of Gilchrist (1880) and that the Ross plates for Job may well have been made for the first edition of Gilchrist (1863).</p>
            <p>It is curious that the Gilchrist copperplates should have been separated after 1880, for the other prints appearing in 1863 and 1880 do not appear to be in the Ross collection. The list of illustrations in the second edition gives the source of six plates as "Block lent by Messrs. Scribner &amp; Co.":

In its time this was a far better known plate than any of Blake's, and its discovery in the archive is of great interest.</p>

            <p>AS is well documented, Robert Cromek had a great talent for marketing that emerged in his promotion of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>.<ref target="n99" type="note">1</ref> He ran a two-year advertising campaign in more than ten newspapers and magazines across England and Scotland. These included the <hi rend="i">Birmingham Gazette</hi> and <hi rend="i">Birmingham Commercial Herald</hi> (July 1806), <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine</hi> (July 1807), <hi rend="i">Artist</hi> (August 1807), <hi rend="i">Monthly Literary Recreations</hi> (September 1807), <hi rend="i">Literary Panorama</hi> and <hi rend="i">Manchester Gazette</hi> (Novemer 1807), <hi rend="i">Wakefield Star and West-Riding Advertiser</hi> (May 1808), <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi>, <hi rend="i">Athenaeum Magazine</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Bristol Gazette</hi>, <hi rend="i">and Public Advertiser</hi> (June 1808), and <hi rend="i">Monthly Literary Advertiser</hi> (July 1808).<ref target="n100" type="note">2</ref> As the list of subscribers in the published volume signifies, Cromek did not limit himself to the literary and artistic markets of London and was ready to find new subscribers across Britain.</p>
            <note id="n99">1. In their facsimile of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, Robert N. Essick and Morton D. Paley call Cromek "an energetic promoter" (<hi rend="i">Robert Blair's</hi> The Grave, <hi rend="i">Illustrated by William Blake: A Study with Facsimile</hi> [London: Scolar Press, 1982] 19). See also G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, 2nd ed. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) [hereafter <hi rend="i">BR</hi>(2)] 208.</note>

            <p>If there was anything strange about his marketing strategy, however, it was his initial neglect of London for Birmingham during the summer of 1806. But a previously undiscovered announcement, which was reprinted two times, suggests that Cromek was very mindful of the London marketpJace that summer:
              <q>Mr. Cromek intends to publish in the course of the ensuing winter a series of 12 [twelve] Engravings, etched in a very superior style of excellence by Louis Schiavonetti, from the original  inventions of William Blake, illustrative of Blair's popular Poem "The Grave." In consequence of the originality of the designs and their vigorous expression, the work has been honoured with the patronage of the principal members of the Royal Academy, and the first professors of art in the metropolis, and by the subscriptions of upwards of 300 [250] of the most distinguished amateurs.<ref target="n101" type="note">3</ref></q>
              In London, the notice ran in the July issue of the <hi rend="i">Universal Magazine</hi> and the August issue of the <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi>. It is the only reference to Blake in the <hi rend="i">Universal Magazine</hi>,<ref target="n102" type="note">4</ref> and was published in a section entitled "Modern Discoveries, and Improvements in Arts, Sciences, and Literature," alongside other forthcoming books. In the <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi>, it appeared in its "Monthly Retrospect of the Fine Arts," which included prints and books with prints. Since the text is nearly identical in both magazines, the announcement was presumably written by Cromek and not the editors. It is also found in the October 1806 <hi rend="i">Monthly Anthology, and Boston Review</hi>, which reprinted the <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi> version in its "Intelligence" section that provided notices regarding British books. This notice may be the earliest reference to Blake in America, and it might explain the presence of J. Brown from Boston in the list of the subscribers to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>. While it is possible that Cromek had his eye on the potential market across the Atlantic, it is more likely, given Blair's popularity in America, that the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> project simply appealed to the Boston editor, who reprinted it without either Blake's or Cromek's knowledge.</p>

"Modern Discoveries, and Improvements in Arts, Sciences, and Literature," <hi rend="i">Universal Magazine</hi> 6 (July 1806): 47-48; "Monthly Retrospect of the Fine Arts," <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi> (Aug. 1806): 61; "Intelligence," <hi rend="i">Monthly Anthology, and Boston Review</hi> 3 (Oct. 1806): 559.
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Universal Magazine</hi> version is quoted above, with the numbers in brackets appearing in the <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi> and <hi rend="i">Monthly Anthology</hi>. In accidentals, these versions differ from the <hi rend="i">Universal Magazine</hi> notice in capitals, lineation, punctuation, and the use of the phrase "the [as opposed to "their"] vigorous expression." More significantly, the <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi> and <hi rend="i">Monthly Anthology</hi> leave out the reference to the patronage of Royal Academy members, deleting "the principal members of the Royal Academy, and."</p></note>
            <note id="n102">4. The <hi rend="i">Universal Magazine</hi> 11 (Feb. 1809): 132-39, would give a very favorable review of Cromek's <hi rend="i">Reliques of Robert Burns</hi>.</note>
            <p>The biggest question raised by the announcements is why the number of subscribers was reduced from 300 in the <hi rend="i">Universal Magazine</hi> to 250 in the <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi> version. Perhaps the <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi> version was written first but published later. This idea would accord with the fact that the number of subscribers seems to have risen steadily. In November 1807 Cromek reported getting seventy-two "at Manchester in less than 3 Weeks" (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>(2) 249), and the change in number in the announcements implies that he was working at a similar clip in the summer of 1806. By the time the book was published there would be "578 subscribers for 688 copies."<ref target="n103">5</ref> Despite Cromek's success in garnering subscriptions, the idea that the volume would be published in the "ensuing winter" suggests that he envisioned a very truncated production schedule, meaning that the famous portrait of Blake was likely not part of the original plan, since Blake did not sit for Thomas Phillips until April 1807 (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>(2) 232). Finally, the newly discovered notices offer some evidence that Blake was aware of how <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> was being marketed. They were the only advertisements for <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> to reference "the most distinguished amateurs," and Blake's first recorded reference to the English amateur came in his letter to the <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi> (1 July 1806) defending Fuseli's painting of Dante's Ugolino. As Paley has recently stressed, "amateur" was still considered a novel, if not foreign, import in English discussion of the arts, and Blake's parody of it in his notebook quip
              <pb id="p43-110" n="110"/>
            "The Cunning sures &amp; the Aim at yours" may have been spurred by its association with Cromek's fashionable marketing language.<ref target="n104" type="note">6</ref></p>

            <p>THOSE who write on Bob Dylan appear to take for granted the influence of Blake on his "Gates of Eden" (in performance by 31 October 1964, then issued on <hi rend="i">Bringing It All Back Home</hi>, March 1965, and as the flip side to the single version of "Like a Rolling Stone," July 1965). Michael Gray speaks for many, if at greater length, in stating that "the purposive force of what is palpably Blakeian impinges in every verse. It is the major Dylan song prior to 'Every Grain Of Sand' that is most like Blake, and like the most characteristic Blake at that." Without giving specifics, Gray argues that "the general themes of 'Gates of Eden' could not be more Blakeian and nor could their treatment. Dylan is treating of balances of opposites--of material wealth and spiritual; of earthly reality and the imaginatively real; of the body and soul; of false gods and true vision; of self-gratification and salvation; of mortal ambitions and the celestial city; of sins and forgiveness; of evil and good."<ref target="n105" type="note">1</ref> Lawrence Wilde suggests, more concretely but equally without evidence, that "William Blake's poem 'Gates of Paradise' may well have inspired Dylan's composition," and Mike Marqusee finds "an apt reference to Blake" in the song's seventh-stanza reference to "kingdoms of Experience."<ref target="n106" type="note">2</ref></p>

            <p>The recent publication in facsimile of a manuscript version of "Gates of Eden" enables further speculation about Blake's presence in the song's first stanza, at least, and how it came to pass.<ref target="n107" type="note">3</ref> As published and recorded, the first stanza reads:
            <q>Of war and peace the truth just twists<lb/>
            Its curfew gull just glides<lb/>
            Upon four-legged forest clouds<lb/>
            The cowboy angel rides<lb/>
            With his candle lit into the sun<lb/>
            Though its glow is waxed in black<lb/>
            All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.</q>
            The facsimile has in the third line not "four-legged" but "fungus forest cloud." This, together with the twisting of the truth, the black glow, and the setting "'neath the trees," seems strongly to recall "A Memorable Fancy" in <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, plates 17-18. There the speaker, in the company of "An Angel," finds himself "sitting in the twisted root of an oak. he was suspended in a fungus" and beholding "the sun, black but shining" (E 41).<ref target="n108" type="note">4</ref> In the facsimile the cowboy angel "lights his candle in the sun" (itself replacing the original "his candle burns the day"), which flips us a few plates forward in <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> to the argument that a "man of mechanical talents" producing volumes--or vinyl recordings "waxed in black"--from the writings of inspired authors should "not say that he knows better than his master, for he only holds a candle in sunshine" (pl. 22, E 43).</p>

            <note id="n108">4. The power of this image is evident again several years later in John Gardner's <hi rend="i">Grendel</hi> (New York: Knopf, 1971), where the protagonist "recall[s] something. A void boundless as a nether sky. I hang by the twisted roots of an oak, looking down into immensity. Vastly far away I see the sun, black but shining..." (137).</note>
            <p>It seems likely that Dylan may have come upon or have been reminded of Blake's work through a rapidly developing friendship with Allen Ginsberg that began in early 1964.<ref target="n109" type="note">5</ref> Ginsberg's long-standing and idiosyncratic, deep involvement with Blake is well known, and he "had studied, in particular, the visionary masterpiece, <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>."<ref target="n110" type="note">6</ref> Dylan may have come to his title image not only through Blake's <hi rend="i">Gates of Paradise</hi>, but also through Ginsberg's very early collection <hi rend="i">The Gates of Wrath</hi>. Though not published until 1972, the unique manuscript of these "rhymed poems, 1948-1952," was, surprisingly, in Dylan's possession.<ref target="n111" type="note">7</ref> There, beginning his twenty-fourth year in May 1964, Dylan could have read "Ode: My 24th Year" and its concluding line, "Here is no Eden: this
              <pb id="p43-111" n="111"/>
            is my store." By the release of "Gates of Eden," Dylan was close enough to Ginsberg that they are depicted each wearing the same top hat in photographs on the back cover of <hi rend="i">Bringing It All Back Home</hi> (pictures evidently taken early in 1964).<ref target="n112" type="note">8</ref> For his part, Ginsberg felt strongly enough about the song that in "Who Be Kind To," first read at the International Poetry Incarnation, 11 June 1965, Royal Albert Hall (shortly after he accompanied Dylan's UK concert tour recorded in <hi rend="i">Don't Look Back</hi>), he celebrates the raising up of "joyful voices and guitars / in electric Afric hurrah / for Jerusalem-- / The saints come marching in, Twist &amp; / Shout, and Gates of Eden are named / in Albion again."<ref target="n113" type="note">9</ref></p>
