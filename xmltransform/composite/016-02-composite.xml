        <p>In 1978, the books and papers of Ruthven Campbell Todd relating to William Blake were given
     by his son Dr. F. C. C. Todd to the Brotherton Library of the University of Leeds. The
     Brotherton Library, named after Lord Brotherton who paid for its construction, is the main
     library of the University for the humanities and social sciences. It is nobly housed and is
     especially rich in English literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>
        <p>What follows is primarily a catalogue of Ruthven Todd’s papers relating to William
     Blake presented to the Brotherton Library, but it is both more and less than that. It is less
     in that some of the Papers from Todd seem to have no connection with Blake<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> or are merely printed works without annotation,<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> and consequently they are dealt with only in footnotes here. It is more in
     that it includes a) some works related to Blake in the Library which did not come from Ruthven
     Todd, and b) some works in the Todd collection which are not about Blake but which are about
     his contemporaries. <note id="n1"><hi rend="s">1</hi> 314 <hi rend="i">Begins</hi>

     order of date of publication.<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> Each entry begins with the
     earliest version of the work and concludes with the published version or, if it was revised <hi rend="i">after</hi> publication, with the revisions. At the conclusion of the list of

          <p>Two statements by Ruthven Todd in these papers may be sufficient to establish a biographical
      context for these manuscripts. The first is in an application to the Chapelbrook Foundation on
      15 June 1968 for support in preparing the new edition of Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life
       of William Blake</hi>: <q> I don’t know what I should say about myself. Fifty-four

       moved to London, worked as tutor and publisher’s reader, reviewer and other jobs. War
       years was in Civil Defence [<hi rend="i">as a conscientious objector to military
       service</hi>], and then worked in a bookstore before (bombed out) moving to Essex. To U.S.A.
       January 1947. Lived mostly in New York (apart from short semester in Iowa City) till 1954.
       Lived on Martha’s Vineyard till 1960. Came to Mallorca to spend summer as guest of
       Robert Graves. Got ill and spent return money. Have now got a cottage home. Have written
       several books of poems, novels (not really good enough), essays on art and science, and
       edited books on painting and selections from poets. Much more could be said, but I think that
       may serve.<lb/> [<hi rend="i">No. 44</hi>] </q> And in a latter to the distinguished Blake
      collector George Goyder he wrote on 6 February 1970: <q> I dropped out of the Blake world into

          <p>As a young man, Todd became fascinated by Blake and collected works by and about him as
      assiduously as his very slender means permitted. He once had an extensive library of Blake and
      Flaxman, and the Flaxmans in particular were quite important. The bibliography section of
      Todd’s copy of his edition of Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life of William
       Blake</hi> (1942), below, is annotated: <q> All items underlined in red were in my library at
       Tilty Mill House nr. Dunmow, at the end of 1946 (dotted lines show that I owned only the
       plates). It was a pretty good library as libraries go and like all good libraries it went.
       The rest of my Blake collection [<hi rend="i">of scholarship</hi>] is also now scattered.

              <hi rend="b">Ruthven Todd’s Blake Work</hi>
            </title>
          </head>
          <p>Most of Ruthven Todd’s accomplishments were in poetry and fiction, but he made a
      major contribution to Blake scholarship. From his earliest published work on Blake (1941) to
      his latest (1980), he showed an extraordinary skill in finding new facts and relating them
      illuminatingly to Blake’s work, in areas as diverse as the two engravers named William
      Blake, to his pigments, to the discovery of his advertisement for his "Exhibition of
      Paintings in Fresco." Todd’s earliest and his greatest Blake enterprise was his
      revised edition of Alexander Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi> which,
      from its first publication in 1863, was recognized as being of central importance for Blake
      studies: <q> Its effect was thunderous. Never has an important [<hi rend="i">English</hi>]
       literary reputation been posthumously established so instantaneously and effectively.<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref><note id="n7"><hi rend="s">7</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Books</hi> (1977), 25.</note></q> Gilchrist’s biography was repeatedly reprinted, in 1880, 1906, 1907, 1922, and
      1928 and proved its lasting value.</p>
          <p>There were, however, a number of serious defects to the work. For one thing, the collection
      of Blake’s writings in Volume II, edited by D. G. Rossetti and a syndicate of the
      Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, was seriously incomplete and inaccurate, though it displayed to
      the public far more of Blake’s work than had previously been popularly available. For
      another, Gilchrist’s transcriptions of Blake’s letters in his biography were
      often merely approximate and usually at one or two removes from the manuscripts. And for a
      third, Gilchrist was alarmed by footnotes and systematically omitted identification of the
      sources of his information. All these factors made the work difficult to depend upon, but,
      because Gilchrist had talked to many of Blake’s young disciples such as John Linnell
      and Frederick Tatham and Samuel Palmer, his book cannot be ignored. Ruthven Todd approached
      these problems boldly and solved them successfully. First, he simply omitted
      Gilchrist’s Volume II with its incomplete and inaccurate writings, reproductions, and
      catalogues of Blake. Second, he corrected the texts of Blake’s letters and poems in
      Gilchrist’s biography (except where Gilchrist is the only authority for them, of
      course). Thirdly, and most laboriously, he sought out systematically the factual bases for
      Gilchrist’s <pb id="p16-74" n="74"/> conclusions and anecdotes and displayed them in
      meticulous notes to the biography. Todd’s edition appeared in a modest Everyman edition
      in January 1942, was promptly recognized as a major work of scholarship, and a new edition
      appeared in 1945 with somewhat expanded notes. With its handsome prints from the Virgil
      electrotypes, it was attractive as well as useful, and it is certainly the cheapest and
      probably the best biography of Blake which has appeared.</p>
          <p>For the next forty years, Ruthven Todd collected materials for a new edition of his
      Gilchrist. After the war, he went to the United States of North America, partly to experiment
      with methods of recreating color-printing as Blake practiced it. He also wrote the Blake
      section (1945) of his <hi rend="i">Tracks in the Snow</hi>, a little, cancelled book on Blake
      (1947), an essay on Blake’s illuminated printing (1948), introductions to facsimiles of
       <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> (1947) and <hi rend="i">America</hi>
      (1947), and trifling, popularizing essays on Blake for an exhibition in Hong Kong (1949) and a
      collection of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Poems</hi> (1949). Thereafter, except for a brief
      note on Blake and Fuseli (1954), a short poem <figure><head>Illus. 1-6 are botanical drawings and notes of 1965-66 in Majorca by Ruthven Todd, from
        a notebook belonging to his son Dr. C.C. Todd, by whose permission and generosity they are
        here reproduced.</head></figure> on Blake (1961), and a slight edition of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> (1960), he produced
      nothing on Blake until his announcement of "Gilchrist Redivivus" (1968). Thereafter,
      there was a flow of correspondence and notes about Blake, focusing on Gilchrist.</p>
          <p>He had a large correspondence with Blake scholars and collectors—he wrote to many
      scholars with queries and advice, and he wrote at enormous length. One might receive three
      ten-page, single-spaced, densely argued letters in a month—and then hear nothing for a
      year or more. These letters were often mini-essays, and generous and admiring editors made
      more than one into published articles—such as the posthumous one of 1980. Much of
      Ruthven Todd’s best work on Blake was in stimulating others through this private
      correspondence.</p>
          <p>Besides his surprisingly extensive Blake publications and correspondence, Ruthven Todd
      worked on at least four books on Blake which he did not live to finish. One is the catalogue
      raisonné of Blake’s art (298.1 below) on which Sir Geoffrey Keynes also worked
      and which was a basis for Martin Butlin’s great <hi rend="i">Paintings and Drawings of
       William Blake</hi>, 2 vols. (1981). Another is the Phoenix House book on <hi rend="i">William
       Blake</hi> of 1947 (No. 300 below) which was cancelled after it reached galley proof stage.
      Another was to be called <hi rend="i">William Blake: The Commercial Engraver.</hi></p>
          <figure/>
          <pb id="p16-75" n="75"/>
          <p>Most important was his new edition of Gilchrist For this work, he made extensive additions
      to a copy of his 1942 edition, which he subsequently lost in Iowa and then recovered years
      later. In the interval, in 1968 he had a copy of the 1945 edition taken a part and mounted on
      large leaves in three volumes, and these he annotated extensively and often differently than
      in the for-a-time-lost copy. At the same time he was corresponding vigorously with scholars
      and making tentative arrangements with the Clarendon Press to publish the new edition. The
      work he did was detailed and valuable, and much of it is new and fascinating. For instance, he
      quotes a "Cutting, dated 9.vi.1920 from Catalogue" (not further identified) of a
      "MS. Petition in favour of Wm. Carey being appointed Keeper of Paintings, etc. signed by
      Jas Northcote, Hy. Fuseli, Jas. Ward, Maria Cosway, Wm. Blake, Rd. Westall, Geo. Clint, John
      Constable, and other artists of the period, 1 p. folio" (1942, p. 221)—this must
      be the original of the <hi rend="i">printed</hi> document of December 1820 quoted in <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> (1969), 269. He also quotes an unpublished letter from Samuel
      Palmer to George Richmond of March 1879 in which Palmer speculates about a portrait of Milton
      etched by Blake "when three years of age."<ref target="n8" type="note">8</ref><note id="n8"><hi rend="s">8</hi> Gilchrist (1942), p. 17—see "A Portrait of
       Milton Engraved by William Blake ‘When Three Years of Age’?—A
       Speculation by Samuel Palmer," <hi rend="i">University of Toronto Quarterly</hi>, LI
       (1981), 28-35.</note></p>
          <p>These fascinating materials for a new edition of Gilchrist are very extensive and very
      incomplete. They deserve to be brought into order and up to date <figure/> and published. I
      have agreed to serve as midwife if a publisher can be found—Ruthven Todd wanted the
      work to be very extensively illustrated and very inexpensive—but thus far no publisher
      has shown interest in it. Meanwhile there is a great store-house of biographical information
      about Blake among the Ruthven Todd Papers at Leeds.</p>

       datable up to 1946 [f. 110]), TS and MS, 231 ff.; the MS annotations are probably in the hand
       of Geoffrey Keynes. [There is a typescript (1942) of the catalogue in the Library of Congress
       (pressmark: NC 1115. B72T6). The work was completely revised by Martin Butlin, whose great
       catalogue raisonné was published as <hi rend="i">The Paintings and Drawings of William
        Blake</hi>, 2 vols. (1981).]</p>
            <p>1947</p>
            <p>300 <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi>[: The Vision of Reality <hi rend="i">del</hi>] [A
       Mental Prince <hi rend="i">del</hi>] (London: Phoenix House, 1947), TS preliminaries (32
       plates described but not reproduced), appendices, and index, 35 ff., and 29 galley proofs of
       the text (c. 33,000 words).</p>
            <p>Recently I was asked by Ruthven Todd’s son Christopher to look at the work to judge
       whether it is worth publishing today, thirty-five years after its printing.</p>
            <p>The book is aimed at a popular rather than a scholarly audience. <q> This short account of
        the life and works of William Blake . . . is primarily concerned with <pb id="p16-79" n="79"/> Blake as an artist [<hi rend="i">but</hi>] considerable attention has had to be devoted
        to his philosophy and mythology in order to present an understandable picture of the man
        whom I believe to be one of the greatest of Englishmen.<lb/><lb/> [<hi rend="i">Prefatory
         Note</hi>] </q> Its alternative, deleted sub-titles indicate the wider context: The Vision
       of Reality; A Mental Prince. It consists of ten chapters: Orientation; Childhood and Youth;
       Poetic Genius; Experience and Expression; The Enemy of Oil; Felpham; With a Different Face
       [about Cromek and Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> designs]; The Grand Style of Art
       Restored [dealing with Blake’s 1809 exhibition]; "I am Hid"; His Own Eternal
       House. There is also a typescript Dedication to B. C., Prefatory Note, Contents, Notes on the
       [32] Illustrations, a note on The Location of Blake’s Pictures, Bibliography of Books
       by and About Blake, and an Index.</p>
            <p>The book is sensible and useful but not very original or interesting, and it is now
       seriously outdated. Much of it is quotation from Blake—The Proverbs of Hell are here
       in full, for instance—but there are no notes or specific indications of sources,
       though Todd does cite scholars such as M. O. Percival and Anthony Blunt. The Prefatory Note
       gives thanks to "my friends Geoffrey Grigson, Geoffrey Keynes, W. E. Moss, and W. Graham
       Robertson for unpublished information and material", and some facts and documents quoted
       here were otherwise unknown in 1947. He quotes, for example, from John Linnell’s
       (still) unpublished autobiography about Blake, and he relates that <q> Mr Graham Robertson .
        . . told me that when, nearly fifty years ago, he first visited Captain Butts, the grandson
        of Blake’s benefactor . . . , he found pictures painted on copper hanging against hot
        water pipes, a treatment no picture, unless it was one of George Stubbs’ enamels,
        could have been expected to survive. </q> Had Ruthven Todd’s <hi rend="i">William
        Blake</hi> been published in 1947, it would have brought him some money and extended William
       Blake’s fame, but it would not have made a permanent addition to our understanding and
       appreciation of Blake. It was a competent money-spinner which suffers little disservice from
       being known only through this notice.</p>
            <p>There is no reference to the book in the Phoenix House archives now in Reading University
       Library, as I am informed by Michael Bott, Assistant Archivist there. The galleys bear
       corrections by the house editor but apparently none by Todd—perhaps he never returned
       the proofs.</p>

        <p>Northrop Frye suggested that the name Ololon in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> derives from
     "ululation," a word Blake himself uses in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi><ref target="n10" type="note">1</ref> In both English and Latin (from which the English words come
     directly), <hi rend="i">ululate</hi> means to howl, wail, or lament, and <hi rend="i">ululation</hi> either a howl, wail, or cry of lamentation, or the action of howling or
     wailing (<hi rend="i">OED</hi>; Lewis &amp; Short, <hi rend="i">A Latin Dictionary</hi>).
      <note id="n10"><hi rend="s">1</hi><hi rend="i">Fearful Symmetry</hi> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1947), p. 143; cf.
       <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> 4:62.</note></p>
        <p>Frye’s etymology has gone generally unchallenged, though two scholars mention (in
     passing) what is clearly the single, direct origin of the name. Peter F. Fisher remarks simply
     that Ololon was "a name probably derived from a Greek word (ὀλολύζειν) which signified the
     crying of women to the gods."<ref target="n11" type="note">2</ref> Harold Bloom also notes
                    that Ololon is from ὀλολύζειν, but he misinterprets the Greek and follows Frye in discussing
     "the lamentation of women to the gods."<ref target="n12" type="note">3</ref> Grief
                    and mourning, however, may not be the aspects of ὀλολύζειν that Blake wished to suggest. As defined
                    in Liddell and Scott’s <hi rend="i">Greek-English Lexicon</hi> (1961), the verb ὀλολύζειν,
                    with the related words ὀλολυγών and ὀλολυγαῖος, applies to "women crying aloud to the gods in
     prayer or thanksgiving," to "the cries of goddesses," and to "women crying
     to the gods . . . mostly in sign of joy." A survey of classical uses of the word from
     Homer (e.g., <hi rend="i">Od.</hi> 22.411, <hi rend="i">Il.</hi> 6.301) to Aristophanes (e.g.,
      <hi rend="i">Birds</hi> 222, <hi rend="i">Knights</hi> 1327) and the tragedians indicates not
     only that the word has jubilant connotations, but that it was sometimes used in specific
     opposition to a cry of lament. This is particularly evident in a scene from Euripides’
      <hi rend="i">Medea</hi>, in which a messenger describes Creusa’s death from poison and
     her handmaiden’s reaction to it. The servant initially thinks it a portent from the
     gods: <q>καί τις γεραιὰ προσπόλων, δόξασά που<lb/>
         ἢ Πανὸς ὀργὰς ἢ τινὸς θεῶν μολεῖν,<lb/>

        <p>There is a secondary meaning of ὀλολύζειν which may have influenced Blake in the choice of a name
     for his character. Johannes Scapula’s sixteenth-century <hi rend="i">Lexicon
      Graeco-Latinum</hi>, the standard Greek lexicon of Blake’s day (used, for example, by
     Shelley and members of his circle in their Greek studies), gives, along with the earlier
     meanings of the verb, the Aristotelian definition of ὀλολυγών: <hi rend="i">Ululatus: et
      peculiariter is quem mares ranae edunt, cum foeminas ad coitum vocant</hi> (I. 1816:
     "out-cry: and particularly that which male frogs emit when they <pb id="p16-83" n="83"/>
     call the females to coitus").<ref target="n14" type="note">5</ref> Although this is a
     technical term which applies to the male of the species—in contrast to the literary
     ὀλολύζειν, which is an exclusively female activity<ref target="n15" type="note">6</ref>—it
     is possible that Blake read Scapula and chose to incorporate sexual connotations into his
     Ololon, perhaps overlooking the masculine emphasis that appears only in <hi rend="i">mares</hi>
                    of the Latin definition. Ὀλολυγών, which transliterates as <hi rend="i">ololugōn</hi>, is
     the form of the word closest to the name Blake selects: he need only drop the penultimate
     syllable to arrive at "Ololon." <note id="n14"><hi rend="s">5</hi> Cf. Aristotle, <hi rend="i">Historia Animalium</hi> 536<hi rend="s">a</hi>11, and Aelianus, <hi rend="i">De

      a shout of gladsome praise"; trans. H. Weir-Smith, Loeb Classical Library edition of

        <p>Although Blake did not enjoy a formal education, he did study foreign languages and
     literatures. His library certainly contained books in French and Italian, and Frederick Tatham
     maintained that Blake also owned Hebrew, Latin, and Greek texts.<ref target="n16" type="note">7</ref> In 1803, Blake wrote to his brother James that the Greek lessons which he was taking
     from William Hayley were progressing well: "I go on Merrily with my Greek &amp; Latin; am
     very sorry that I did not begin to learn languages early in life as I find it very Easy . . . .
     I read Greek as fluently as an Oxford scholar &amp; the Testament is my chief master:
     astonishing indeed is the English Translation, it is almost word for word. . . ."<ref target="n17" type="note">8</ref> Blake’s own estimation of his fluency may be taken
     with a grain of salt (the two men apparently confined their studies to the New Testament and to
     collating Cowper’s Homer<ref target="n18" type="note">9</ref>), but one may assume that
     the poet had a working knowledge of classical Greek and doubtless made use of a Greek
     lexicon—in all likelihood Scapula’s. He could, therefore, have been aware of the
     range of meaning and the subtle ramifications thereof that the word ὀλολύζειν suggests for the
     character he creates. <note id="n16"><hi rend="s">7</hi> G. E. Bentley, Jr., and Martin K.

        <p>How appropriate, then, is this derivation of "Ololon" for the Blakean character and
     for <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> as a whole? Susan Fox’s study of the poem, <hi rend="i">Poetic Form in Blake’s "Milton"</hi> (Princeton University Press, 1976)
     provides insight into Ololon’s nature and into her relations with the poet-character
      Milton.<ref target="n19" type="note">10</ref> Accepting Fox’s outline of the structure
     and action of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, we suggest that there are additional nuances in the
     poem when one takes into account the Greek derivation and meanings of the name
     "Ololon." <note id="n19"><hi rend="s">10</hi> See also John Howard, <hi rend="i">Blake’s "Milton": A Study in the Selfhood</hi> (Rutherford, N. J.:

      their Shambhala edition of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (1978).</note></p>
        <p>When Ololon first appears in Book I (Plate 21),<ref target="n20" type="note">11</ref> it is
     as a "sweet River, of milk &amp; liquid pearl" (21:15). At this point, Ololon is the
     lifegiving river of Eden—unconscious and undifferentiated sexuality—its qualities
     of "milk and liquid pearl" suggesting a union of the milk of women’s breasts
     and the pearly semen of the male.<ref target="n21" type="note">12</ref> But a crucial change in
     the status of Ololon takes place in Plate 21. On the "mild banks" of the river Ololon
     "dwelt those who Milton drove / Down into Ulro" (both grammar and context demand that
     we read "those . . . who" as the subject of "drove" and "Milton"
     as the object, driven "Down into Ulro"). As Ololon will ultimately be revealed to
     Blake-in-Felpham as human history ("the Woof of Six Thousand Years," 42:15), we can
     infer from the varied descriptions of Ololon on Plate 21 that the river represents the flow of
     historical process, while "those" who dwell on its "mild banks" are
     individual historical figures and societies. In Eden, where all contraries are united, these
     embody both the potentialities and the past realizations of the historical process. Among them,
     therefore, are both the beings and forces who conditioned the historical John Milton in his
     failure to fulfill his potentiality (hence driving him to Ulro) and all unrealized
     potentialities in the idea of "Milton" awaiting redemption through incarnation:
     "they wept" and "The mountains" (identified as "the river’s
     living banks," that is, the limiting parameters of historical necessity)
     "wail’d!" at the fate of Milton. Each dawn "the Family / Of Eden heard
     the lamentation" though "the clarions of day" soon "drowned the
     lamentations / And when night came . . . all refused to lament" (21:23-26). But the
     lamentation at dawn suffices to begin "Providence," which Blake saw as the ambiguous
     intrusion of Eternity into Time.<ref target="n22" type="note">13</ref><note id="n20"><hi rend="s">11</hi> Text and plate and line numbers are from <hi rend="i">The

        <p>When the laments reach "the Family Divine" and "the Cloud of Milton"
     stretches "over Europe," the Four Zoas unite into the figure of "One Man"
     weeping over Ololon (21:39). Ololon then begins to "feel Pity" for Milton (21:54) and
     thereby breaks the unconscious unity of its self-contained Edenic state, incarnating through a
     series of transformations, beginning with a metamorphosis from river into the
     "Clouds" which accompany the manifestation of "One Man even Jesus"
     (21:58-60).</p>
        <p>In Book the Second, this composite group of clouds descends to Beulah, the "place where
     Contrarieties are equally True" (30:1). Their "descent" is not a qualitative
     one: as Fox notes, Beulah is not a lesser, but simply a different state from Eden.<ref target="n23" type="note">14</ref> Unlike the Edenic world of sexual union between contraries,
     Beulah is incapable of accepting the potential stress of conflict between opposing essences. It
     is a world of protected, infantile sexuality and maternal love: "Beulah to its inhabitants
     appears . . . / As the beloved infant in his mother’s bosom round incircled"
     (30:10-11). As Ololon passes through this place, the inhabitants of Beulah lament, fearing the
     impending struggle of the final judgment as "they saw the Lord coming / In the Clouds of
     Ololon with Power &amp; Great Glory" (31:15-16). As the Clouds of Ololon pass through
     this moony world, they begin to lament with Beulah. The river of sexual union destabilizes and
     dissolves as it drifts through the half-realized realm of childish innocence<ref target="n24" type="note">15</ref>—its contraries are separated, and Ololon, now split into
     distinguishable "Sons &amp; Daughters" (30:4), laments in a world in which mature
     sexual love is frustrated: "Men are sick with Love!" (31:62). <note id="n23"><hi rend="s">14</hi> Fox, <hi rend="i">Poetic Form</hi>, pp. 9-10, 128 ff.</note><note id="n24"><hi rend="s">15</hi> Compare Shelley’s use of the hydrogen cycle in <hi rend="i">Prometheus Unbound</hi>, II.ii.70-82.</note></p>
        <p>As "the Divine Voice was heard in the Songs of Beulah" (33:1 ff.), there comes a
     change in the quality of union from a "mild and gentle" state to a period of jealousy
     and strife: "now thou art terrible / In jealousy &amp; unlovely in my sight, because thou
     hast cruelly / Cut off my loves in fury till I have no love left for thee" (33:5-7). Yet a
     temporary answer to this pain of division <hi rend="i">is</hi> offered: the "Songs of
     Beulah in the Lamentations of Ololon" end with a promise of a renewal of self-effacing
     trust, "When the Sixfold Female" (the Emanations representing Milton’s wives
     and daughters) shall "relent" and "give / Her maidens to her <pb id="p16-84" n="84"/> husband: delighting in his delight" (33:14-18); "then &amp; then alone
     begins the happy Female joy, / As it is done in Beulah" (33:19-20). In the
     infantile/maternal state of Beulah, the female’s abnegation of self takes the form of
     nourishing the male by providing him with whatever he desires, "delighting in his
     delight."</p>
        <p>This self-effacement, however, does not solve the problem posed by historic Milton’s
     descent to "Eternal Death." Ololon must continue to journey until the potentialities
     inherent in the eternal idea of Milton reunite with the figure fixed by history, rejoining
     Milton’s aggressive maleness with the principle of selfless union hitherto possible to
     maleness only in the Edenic realm of potentiality. To that end, Ololon continues its descent
     into the generated world of the "Mundane Shell." Reaching "rocky Albion,"
     it takes on a final incarnation in Blake’s own garden as "a Virgin of twelve
     years" (36:17).</p>
        <p>Ololon, now embodied as an unthreatening female Emanation, meets her ideal Spectre,
     "Milton," now embodied in William Blake. After admitting to him that she has fostered
     false natural religion in her previous incarnations, she hears "Milton" declare the
     need for mutual annihilation and replies once again "in clouds of despair" (41:29).
     Then, the virgin "with a shriek" separates into six parts, splits "Away from
     Ololon" (i.e., the Eden potentiality), and flees "into the depths / of
     Milton’s Shadow" (42:3-6). The explosive chemistry of the union of Spectre and
     Emanation produces the vision of "One Man Jesus the Saviour," wrapped in a garment
     "named the Woof of Six Thousand Years" (42:11, 15): in short, the union of the Divine
     Image of Man, clothed in the matrix of human history. This final action, occurring in the world
     of generation and yet not fully partaking of it, restores to Ololon the ideal unity of
     sexuality that had been its original nature in Eden. Now, however, its wholeness results not
     from complacent, unthinking acceptance of its potentiality but from self-conscious choice in
     the realm of actuality.</p>
        <p><hi rend="i">Milton</hi> is, among many other things, the story of a journey from a
     pre-sexual state through childhood/motherhood to the full awareness of adult sexual maturity.
     The union of male and female in the original river Ololon and the similar union in the final
     plate of the poem are both manifestations of a perfect fusion of contraries; only the last
     combination, however, which takes place within the Mundane Shell, redeems William Blake and,
     through him, mankind, existent within the Mundane Shell.</p>
        <p>If "Ololon" means, as we maintain, a cry of joy or a cry to the gods, then the
     "lamentations" attributed to manifestations of Ololon throughout the poem have a
     multiple significance. First, they are, even in the depths of despair, cries to the
     gods—i.e., to the powers of self-knowledge and self-sacrifice that will eventually
     destroy false natural religion and enable Ololon to recombine with Milton in a mutual
      redemption.<ref target="n25" type="note">16</ref> Secondly, on a linguistic plane,
     Ololon’s journey represents a passage from meaning through nonsense to full meaning
     again. While in her river state, "Ololon" is both a cry to the Divine within humanity
     and an expression of sexuality. When she at last rediscovers her true nature, in the garden at
     Felpham, she is once again this combination of sexuality and joy. Her lamentations of
     Milton’s fate in Eden and in Beulah are, like her incarnation in Beulah in the form of
     clouds, incomplete. They do not represent Ololon’s true nature—until the female
     potentialities in her can be united with Milton, neither is she whole in any sense, nor has the
     full significance of her name unfolded. Finally, the fact that those lamentations that begin in
     Eden are replaced by the rejoicing implicit in Ololon’s name only within the Mundane
     Shell demonstrates again that Blake’s ideal state lies within the quotidian world of
     full human experience—not in some external heaven or realm of forms. <note id="n25"><hi rend="s">16</hi> Cf. the trusting cry of the despairing Trojan women in <hi rend="i">Iliad</hi> 6, as they plead with Athena: αἱ δ ὀλολυγῇ πᾶσαι Ἀθήνῃ χεῖρας ἀνέσχον (6.301: "all the women, in a cry [<hi rend="i">ololugē</hi>] to Athena, lifted up their hands . . . ").</note></p>
        <p>The etymology of "Ololon" reinforces the idea that the names Blake
     "coins" are neither arbitrary nor merely onomatopoeic, but have traditional
     historical or linguistic bases. And despite the uncompromising condemnation of the classics in
     the Preface to <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (later suppressed), the classical antecedents of
     "Ololon" indicate that Blake was at least interested enough in ancient secular
     literature to pursue the implications of a few words therefrom—more, perhaps, than have
     thus far been identified.</p>

        <p>Since the last survey of sales (<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 14, [summer 1980] 4-21), the market
     for books by and about Blake has continued its steady upward course, in some cases beating the
     general inflation rate by a fair margin. Libraries and individuals building a Blake collection
     will have to pay more than ever, but at least the major scholarly works continue to be
     available. Early facsimiles have increased more than other genres of Blakeana, and the
     publications of the Blake Trust have held their value in spite of wide availability. The
     spectacular increases registered by a few books with engravings by Blake, such as Stuart &amp;
     Revett’s <hi rend="i">Antiquities of Athens</hi> and Hunter’s <hi rend="i">Historical Journal</hi>, have little to do with Blake’s contributions. Travel books of
     all sorts, classical antiquities, and natural history books have shot well ahead of the general
     Blake market. The exception is of course original copies of the illuminated books. Certainly
     the most notable sales of 1980-1981, from both a financial and scholarly perspective, were in
     this area. Two copies of <hi rend="i">Song of Innocence and of Experience</hi> reappeared on
     the market, one printed by Blake and lost from sight since 1830, the other a posthumous copy
     not recorded since 1920. The former is an exceedingly important discovery, for it is the only
     copy printed by Blake containing all the poems he is known to have etched for the <hi rend="i">Songs.</hi> Both copies have been described in the summer 1981 issue of this journal.</p>
        <p>It is always difficult to assess the market values of Blake’s original graphics
     because of the rarity of his best separate plates. "Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims"
     used to make frequent appearances on the auction block, but I have found none since the second
     state impression sold in February 1979 and recorded in the last survey of sales. The only
     important separate plate sold in the last two years is an impression of "The Man Sweeping
     the Interpreter’s Parlour" (illus. 5) which, because of its weak inking and/or
     printing, fetched £1200 less than a fine impression (now at the Yale Center for British
     Art) sold at auction in July 1979. The Job series, that masterpiece so readily available every
     season, set what are probably new records at auction (£6300) and in a dealer’s
     catalogue ($15,000).</p>
        <p>Only two important drawings or paintings changed hands in 1980-1981. <hi rend="i">St. Paul
      Shaking Off the Viper</hi> merely passed from one dealer to another; but <hi rend="i">Every
      Man Gave Him a Piece of Money</hi>, a lovely small drawing with a checkered history in recent
     years, has found a permanent home at the Tate Gallery. The market for Blake’s lesser
     drawings has been in the doldrums for at least ten years, and the auctioning of three early
     works (illus. 1-4) in November 1980 offered little hope for movement. But one year later, two
     drawings did very well in a London sale room. <hi rend="i">Saul and David</hi>, an early
     drawing not of overwhelming beauty, is exactly the sort that has attracted few bidders in
     recent years and frequently resulted in a buy-in for the vendor (no sale). Yet, at £1100
     hammer price (the bid for which it was "knocked down" at auction), it fetched a sum
     at the upper end of the house estimate (£800-1200). The second work in the same
     Christie’s sale, <hi rend="i">A Male Nude with an Urn</hi>, looked like an even better
     candidate for failure. I doubt that it would even be attributed to Blake if it were not for the
     rather convincing signature. At £800 hammer price, this pen &amp; ink sketch far
     outdistanced the estimate of £300-400. If this sale represents a trend, what could have
     caused a reversal of a decade-long pattern?</p>
        <pb id="p16-87" n="87"/>
        <p>One answer might be the appearance of Martin Butlin’s monumental catalogue of
     Blake’s paintings and drawings. Such a book gives to its subject a position in the art
     world he would not otherwise command, the imprimatur of professional acceptance within the
     canon of artists deemed worthy of a catalogue raisonné. I need not comment at length on
     the circularity of such bestowals of value or the irony of giving Blake importance by finding
     his pigeonhole in the pantheon. More practically, the inclusion of a sketch like <hi rend="i">A
      Male Nude</hi> in Butlin’s catalogue endows it with an authenticity no auction blurb
     could summon. One successful sale of lesser material does not mean, however, that
     Blake’s work has entered the big-money art market. The next important Blake
     picture—for example, a biblical water color or 1795 color printed drawing in good
     condition—to be offered at auction will be a better harbinger of a change in taste. The
     public knows Blake, or at least knows ‘‘The Ancient of Days,’’ and
     book collectors have increased the market value of his illuminated books well beyond his
     drawings and paintings. Art professionals and major art collectors have yet to follow suit, at
     least with their checkbooks.</p>
        <p>The following record of Blake sales for 1980-1981 is in the same format as the last two
     lists, with but three exceptions. The section on Blake’s Circle and Followers has been
     expanded to include British artists of the generation before Blake’s (James Barry, John
     Hamilton Mortimer, and Alexander Runciman) who may have influenced him or at least worked in
     similar genres and styles. The coverage of Thomas Stothard has been extended to his engraved
     book illustrations. As in the past, oil portraits by Romney and Richmond are excluded. The
     amount of information on secondary materials has been much abbreviated—see the headnote
     to the final section.</p>

          <p>The following section records low and high prices, with more details given for a few special
      items. As a rule of thumb, one can assume that the low price represents an average copy, or
      even one with a worn exterior but sound interior, sold at auction; the high is generally an
      "as new" copy offered in a bookseller’s catalogue. Yet these factors account
      for the wide ranges of prices less than the eternal vagaries of the marketplace. Internally
      damaged or incomplete copies (and, at the other end of the spectrum, copies in elegant
      bindings worth more than their contents) have been excluded. "Special ed." in
      reference to Blake Trust facsimiles refers to copies with additional materials added by the
      publisher, usually templates and progress proofs. Prices in pounds sterling have been
      converted to dollars at the rate of £1=$2. Volumes still in print are not included.</p>

        <p>Both internally and externally, the recent second printing of <hi rend="i">Blake’s
      Poetry and Designs</hi> displays noteworthy improvements. In the first printing the heavy
     color plates failed to adhere to the "Perfect Binding," the trade name for a process
     which has also caused problems in other paperback illustrated books, such as <hi rend="i">The
      Oxford Anthology of English Literature</hi>; in our second printing, however, the binder
     forced the glue further up between pages, and thick and thin pages now appear to be holding
     together. Though this is of course not a new edition, the corrected printing includes important
     additions, such as the excerpt from the letter to Butts on allegory (p. 478), and changes, such
     as the new reading of a crucial phrase in the first Preface to <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (p.
     312). Our original proposal to W. W. Norton had contained full texts of <hi rend="i">The Four
      Zoas</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, but to come within the publisher’s estimated
     price limit of $3.95, we had to trim the total length to 600 pages, including pictures,
     selections from the prose, and the critical essays required by the series format. Sadly, during
     the three years the book was in process of publication, the actual price went up to
     $9.95—still the price of the second printing—and there is obviously now little
     hope that full texts of the longer works will ever be restored in a new edition. Our
     corrections in this printing do not extend to the Bibliography, because the printing was
     carried out before we had submitted our new material; we shall nevertheless indicate the
     changes we had hoped to make in that section. The following list includes substantial changes;
     asterisks (*) indicate further corrections which do <hi rend="i">not</hi> appear in the new
     printing. We would appreciate hearing from readers who discover errors we have overlooked.</p>
        <p>p. xi. <hi rend="i">Add</hi> "To Thomas Butts, April 25, 1803 [*<hi rend="i">should
      be</hi> July 6, 1803] . . . 478"</p>
        <p>*p. xxix. Under "1779" <hi rend="i">add</hi> "Met Flaxman, sculptor" and
     delete Flaxman from the 1780 entry.</p>
        <p>p. xxxvii. For entries under 1820 and 1821, Blake’s "Times," <hi rend="i">substitute</hi> new entries: 1820 (January 29) Death of George III. Prince Regent becomes
     George IV (coronation June, 1821). Keats’s last volume of poems. Shelley’s <hi rend="i">Prometheus Unbound.</hi> Southey’s <hi rend="i">A Vision of Judgment.</hi>
     1821 Death of Keats in Italy. Shelley’s <hi rend="i">Adonais.</hi> Byron’s <hi rend="i">Cain, Don Juan</hi> III-IV.</p>
        <p>*p. xlii. "The Holy Land" map: The southern boundary of the Northern Kingdom should
     be the river Kanah; the letters "NOR" extend too far south. In the inset, Golgotha
     should be outside the city walls.</p>
        <p>p. xliii, line 13 from bottom. <hi rend="i">For</hi> "enlongated" <hi rend="i">read</hi> "elongated."</p>
        <p>p. xlv. Before the final paragraph, <hi rend="i">insert</hi> a new paragraph: <q> Assuming
      that the reader will develop a tolerance for Blake’s irregularities while working
      through this text, we have altered Blake’s punctuation more in the earlier poems, less
      in the later ones. </q></p>
        <p>p. 17. <hi rend="i">Add</hi> a new sentence to the last line: <q> For some early drafts, see
      pp. 176-181. </q></p>
        <p>*p. 21. The lopped-off design, omitting the boy who <pb id="p16-108" n="108"/> hands the
     grapes to the girl, unfortunately could not be corrected in this reprinting.</p>
        <p>p. 40, footnote 7. <hi rend="i">Add</hi>: "cf. <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
     15:8."</p>
        <p>p. 43, footnote 8. <hi rend="i">Add</hi>: "cf. ‘Earth’s
     Answer.’"</p>
        <p>pp. 45-46. The last two stanzas of "The Little Girl Found" should be on p. 45, the
     design on p. 46.</p>
        <p>p. 47. Both stanzas of "The Sick Rose" should appear on this page.</p>
        <p>p. 48, last line of footnote. <hi rend="i">For</hi> "ther" <hi rend="i">read</hi>
     "their."</p>
        <p>p. 49, add to footnote. "See drafts of this poem, pp. 178-180."</p>
        <p>*p. 53, add to footnote 2. "See E. P. Thompson in <hi rend="i">Interpreting Blake</hi>,
     ed. Michael Phillips (1978)."</p>
        <p>p. 54. Keyed to title, "Infant Sorrow," a new footnote 7: "See draft, pp.
     180-182." Subsequent footnotes are renumbered.</p>
        <p>p. 69, line 25. <hi rend="i">For</hi> "of" <hi rend="i">read</hi>
     "on."</p>
        <p>p. 82, line 8. <hi rend="i">For</hi> "Swendenborg’s" <hi rend="i">read</hi>
     "Swedenborg’s."</p>
        <p>*p. 87. <hi rend="i">Correct</hi> "But the following Contraries to these are:" <hi rend="i">to</hi> "But the following Contraries to these are True:"</p>
        <p>p. 88. "A Memorable Fancy," line 2: <hi rend="i">For</hi> "enjoyment" <hi rend="i">read</hi> "enjoyments."</p>
        <p>p. 88, last line of plate 6. After "rock" <hi rend="i">correct</hi> comma to
     semicolon.</p>
        <p>p. 101, footnote 1. <hi rend="i">For</hi> the first sentence of this footnote, <hi rend="i">substitute</hi> a new sentence: "At the beginning of this Memorable Fancy the Devil has
     appeared in this flame."</p>
        <p>*p. 103, second paragraph, line 7 from bottom. <hi rend="i">Delete</hi> "of";
     phrase should read "the antagonists Orc and Urizen."</p>
        <p>p. 104. Before the final paragraph, <hi rend="i">insert</hi> a new paragraph: <q><hi rend="i">America</hi> is the first of the "Lambeth books," works produced while
      the Blakes lived in the Hercules buildings, Lambeth, on the south side of the Thames (see
      map). <hi rend="i">America, Europe, The Song of Los, Urizen, Ahania</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The
       Book of Los</hi> make up a distinct sub-group in Blake’s canon, sharing common themes
      and images of the fallen human condition; each of these has the word "Lambeth" on
      its title page. </q></p>
        <p>p. 121, line 2 (<hi rend="i">America</hi> 16:17). <hi rend="i">Insert</hi> comma after

      years’ trouble Ends in Good Luck at last &amp; shall be forgot by my affections &amp;
      only remember’d by my Understanding; to be a Memento in time to come, &amp; to speak
      to future generations by a Sublime Allegory, which is now perfectly completed into a Grand
      Poem. I may praise it, since I dare not pretend to be any other than the Secretary; the
      Authors are in Eternity. I consider it as the Grandest Poem that this World contains. Allegory
      address’d to the Intellectual powers, while it is altogether hidden from the Corporeal
      Understanding, is my definition of the Most Sublime Poetry; it is also somewhat in the same
      manner defined by Plato. This Poem shall, by Divine Assistance, be progressively Printed
      &amp; Ornamented with Prints &amp; given to the Public. </q></p>
        <p>p. 498, line 3. <hi rend="i">Insert</hi> quotation mark before ‘‘<hi rend="i">Irving</hi>’’; <hi rend="i">delete</hi> quotation mark before "He."

      —‘You never saw the spiritual Sun—I have.—I saw him on Primrose
      Hill.—He said "Do you take me for the Greek Apollo?" "No!" I said.
      "That" (pointing to the Sky) "That is the Greek Apollo—He is
      Satan."’ </q></p>
        <p>*pp. 602-607: Changes we intended to make in the Bibliography take into account the following
     rules of thumb: (1) specialized studies are mentioned only in headnotes and footnotes; (2) only
     the most comprehensive recent treatments of major subjects are included (these in turn refer to
     important earlier studies); (3) essays included in the books listed under "VI. Collections
     of Essays" do not reappear under "VII. Selected Essays"; (4) extensive resetting
     of type is not possible in a corrected printing.</p>
        <p>We hesitate to mention "forthcoming" works because we were wrong about the dates of
     the Butlin catalogue and the Clarendon edition of <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, delayed in
     publication; thus in making corrections we would produce the anomaly of listing 1980-81 books
     in our 1979 edition. We will nevertheless venture to include in our wished-for corrections
     several other recent books but will not attempt to add articles published after 1979. One
     stellar book we had hoped to include now appears to have been cancelled by Scolar Press before
     publication: Sir Geoffrey Keynes’s edition of Copy W of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence
      and of Experience</hi>, announced in <hi rend="i">Book Collector</hi> 29 (1980); such are the
     perils of trying to keep a bibliography current for a future date of publication.</p>

        <p>This issue of our annual checklist of Blake Scholarship is the first in recent years to
     include no major changes in format or authorship. The general categories of the checklist
     remain the same, and we have retained the practice of num-bering entries and concluding with an
     index of authors. An asterisk after an entry number indicates an item that we have not
     personally examined.</p>
        <p>As always, it is a pleasure to record our gratitude to authors who sent notice of their
     recent publications and occasionally, offprints.</p>

          <p>There are several general issues in the basic conception of Diana Hume George’s book
      on Blake and Freud that are timely, significant, and promising, even though the book itself
      falls far short of fulfilling its promise. It is proposed as "a contribution to
      psychoanalytic theory and criticism" (17-18) in the form of an intertextual engagement
      between Freud and Blake, antagonists in a synchronic field of discourse. It is thus in
      different ways both a Blakean and a Freudian project, well worth the undertaking.<ref target="n26" type="note">1</ref> More conspicuously than most poets, Blake situated his work
      among other texts which he cited, engaged in battle, parodied and attempted to transform or
      correct, so producing an intertextual construct constantly aware of the semiotic processes
      which both made the project possible and at the same time tried to inscribe it in the
      already-written code of the competing Urizenic system. Thus to read Freud—"as
      Blake read Milton, and with similar purposes" (69)—as the author whose works
      "constitute the <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> of the twentieth century" (66) could
      be a most fruitful way to engage the too-long-deferred relationships between these two
      authors, to go beyond the Jungians who have had their archetypal ways with Blake’s
      texts for so long, and to expand our growing awareness of the artistic and poetic dimensions
      of Freud’s contribution to literature. <note id="n26"><hi rend="s">1</hi> The only
       other comparable work I have come across in this area is Morris Dickstein’s study of
       the "influence" of Freud on Blake, which concentrates mainly on the <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>: "The Price of Experience: Blake’s
       Reading of Freud," in <hi rend="i">The Literary Freud: Mechanisms of Defense and the
        Poetic Will</hi>, Vol. 4 of the Psychiatry and the Humanities Series, ed. J. H. Smith (New
       Haven: Yale University Press, 1980).</note></p>
          <p>If there is anything distinctive about the discourse we call literature, and in that
      discourse especially true of Blake, it is that <hi rend="i">how</hi> something is said (or
      written) is given as much attention as <hi rend="i">what</hi> is said. Freud too followed this
      same emphasis, which led him to the discovery of a pervasive rhetorical or narrative dimension
      in the psyche and its productions. Certain aspects of his investigations have led in recent
      years to a series of refinements—for better or worse—on his discoveries, in
      which the unconscious can be interpreted as having a structure like that of language, or can
      be understood as being a modality of writing, or a manifestation of universal laws of
      tropology. In all these cases of what, for reductive convenience, we might call "French
      Freud," there is an attempt to follow Freud’s insight that paying attention to the
      mode of exposition or representation (<hi rend="i">Darstellung</hi>) was the best way to
      obtain clues for interpreting the basic nature of the unconscious.</p>
          <p>For George, however—who in spite of her interest in the "major
      revisionists" (18) of Freud, is curiously unaware of or indifferent to French
      Freud—the unconscious exists as a realm of freedom and a source of energy which artists
      can conveniently tap to enable them to overcome the constraints of the reality principle.<ref target="n27" type="note">2</ref> Unlike ordinary people, artists have "special
      gifts" which allow them "access to the unconscious" (49) where they can
      "cathect energy freely and intensely through the displacement and condensation processes.
      . . . While ordinary men and women live in the world of consciousness . . . the artist has
      retained the ability to reconcile paradox . . . to be certain and assert . . . and to escape
      time" (51). The artist "passes freely between and among pleasure and pain, reality
      and fantasy, time and timelessness" (52), and "The reality principle is thereby
      subject to, because created by, the artist" (63). <note id="n27"><hi rend="s">2</hi> The
       only French author cited in the whole study is Bataille, whose "somewhat wiggy
       theses" are described as "valuable to the psychoanalytic critic"
      (239).</note></p>
          <pb id="p16-122" n="122"/>
          <p>According to George, this "theory of art . . . lay buried in Freud’s major
      works" (52), which means that "Psychoanalysis contains the seed of hope and vision
      of which Blake’s system was the harvest a century before" (60). But Freud failed
      to nourish his seed of hope, which therefore "remained latent, that is, unwritten"
      (66). Freud denied himself "the prophetic and prescriptive voice" (147) and instead
      "whispered his manifesto . . . because he dared not shout it, perhaps not even to
      himself" (138). It is only when he is "freed of his mistakes" by George (70)
      that he can be heard to stop muttering and begin shouting what he really means (69-70).
      Presumably it is George’s insight into the "fourth dimension of imaginative
      liberty" as a "redemptive overlay on other ways of thinking, interacting, and being
      in the world" (76) which sharpens her hearing in this manner. Blake, on the other hand,
      was early able "to reverberate the themes" in a manner loud and clear,
      "prophetic and prescriptive" (147). <q> Blake’s own solution was expressed
       numerous times throughout his career in language that remained almost identical throughout
       several decades, from its first expression in <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of
        Albion</hi> to its final expression in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> It consists of a fantasy
       of free love so radical that it still sounds peculiarly shocking in our time. (142) </q> What
      follows this assertion is a lenghty quotation from what George calls the "visionary
      poet-prophet of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>" (127), the Oothoon who expresses
      "Blake’s own solution" and "Blake’s ideal" (142).</p>
          <p>George’s acknowledgement of Freud in this context is thus rather like Freud’s
      basic approach to literature; he never tired of admiring it for having anticipated what he
      took to be the truths of psychoanalysis. But chiefly, perhaps, Freud discovered and
      appreciated what he took to be the mode of production of truth in the literary text, in which
      the truth is deferred because the literary theme does not offer itself directly to the reader
      as such. In this respect, literature was seen to share the most general characteristic of the
      unconscious, that of a modality or economy of indirect representation. For Freud the great
      universal opening for interpretation was the insight that discourse itself can always be read
      as a symptom of something else, as a practice of representation in which the relationship of
      conscious subjects to the discourse they produce is always eccentric. In such a view the
      ultimate Truth is of less concern than the process of signification or meaning (<hi rend="i">Deutung</hi>) as it is available to our understanding through the observation of its
      practice of representation. The problematic relationship between subjects and their writing
      practices constitutes a working area where subjects can learn both about themselves and about
      the nature of language and its functioning by observing that practice closely. As Freud says,
       <q> There is often something in the material itself which takes charge of one and diverts one
       from first intentions. Even such a trivial achievement as the arrangement of a well-known
       piece of material is not entirely subject to an author’s own choice; it takes what
       line it likes and all one can do is ask oneself after the event (<hi rend="i">nachträglich</hi>) why it has happened in this way and no other.<ref target="n28" type="note">3</ref><note id="n28"><hi rend="s">3</hi><hi rend="i"> The Standard Edition of The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud</hi>
        (S.E.), ed. James Strachey <hi rend="i">et al.</hi>, 24 vols. (London: Hogarth Press,
        1953-1974), XVI, 379.</note></q></p>
          <p>There is thus in Freud a profound and pervasive economy of deferral which constitutes both
      the practice of the unconscious and the psyche in general, and becomes the basic and necessary
      modality of meaning (<hi rend="i">Deutung</hi>) and the governing principle of art itself,
      which must wait to be "completed" by interpretation. In this view the
      "Truth" of the Oedipus complex is less important for our understanding of meaning
      than is attention to the process of deferral which informs the structure and texture of the
      tragedy as an interpretable text: <q> The action of the play consists in nothing other than
       the process of revealing, with cunning delays and ever-mounting excitement—a process
       that can be likened to the work of a psycho-analysis—that Oedipus himself is the
       murderer of Laius, but further that he is the son of the murdered man and of Jocasta.<ref target="n29" type="note">4</ref><note id="n29"><hi rend="s">4</hi> S. E., IV, 261-62.</note></q></p>
          <p>This description of the "process" of the tragedy is an apt and knowing
      self-description of Freud’s own characteristic mode of exposition, in which belatedness
       (<hi rend="i">Nachträglichkeit</hi>) is chosen over the illusion of a truth
      immediately available and transparent to the author—a process in which postponement of
      comprehension, of final interpretations and truths, is both justified by and made necessary by
      the nature of meaning itself. Wherever we read in Freud, we find this profound and formal
      sense of process which governs science, art and life, and which must also govern the manner in
      which we interpret and talk about them. <q> We bring expectations with us into the work, but
       they must be forcibly held back. By observation, now at one point and now at another, we come
       upon something new. . . . We put forward conjectures, we construct hypotheses, which we
       withdraw if they are not confirmed, we need much patience and readiness for any eventuality,
       we renounce early convictions so as not to be led by them into overlooking unexpected
       factors. . . .<ref target="n30" type="note">5</ref><note id="n30"><hi rend="s">5</hi> S. E., XXII, 174.</note></q> Freud’s voice here (as at the end of <hi rend="i">Beyond the Pleasure
       Principle</hi>) is not unlike that of Los in Blake’s <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, urging
      his Sons to "be patient yet a little" in order to avoid the "fury
      premature" that results in "Martyrdoms &amp; Wars."</p>
          <p>I find it necessary to make these by now rather familiar observations on Freud in order to
      characterize George’s book adequately as a pursuit of Truth ("I pursue this truth.
      . . . " [p. 27]) which in its haste to reach the appointed end belies the promise of its
      beginnings. George is consistently patronizing of Freud, whom she sees as Blake’s
      "Idiot Questioner" who "publishes doubt &amp; calls it knowledge; whose
      Science is Despair" (178). But her most persistent criticism of him is that he failed his
      promise, by not adopting the role of "prophetic and prescriptive" utterance and
      shouting the Truth of his discoveries.<ref target="n31" type="note">6</ref> In this she has
      not only a remarkably naive and prescriptive view of the authorfunction, <pb id="p16-123" n="123"/> but one which is very much like what Freud was guarding himself against as a
      violation of his whole theory of interpretation, and rather like what Blake reveals as the
      temptation of Milton to found a new religion with a pre-emptive doctrine and discourse of
      Truth. Foucault has shrewdly observed that what he calls the "author-function" is a
      more complicated construct, that it does not develop "spontaneously as the attribution of
      a discourse to an individual," but is rather the result of a "complex operation
      which constructs a certain rational being that we call ‘author,’" and that
      the author-function "is not defined by the spontaneous attribution of a discourse to its
      producer, but rather by a series of specific and complex operations" which do not
      "refer purely and simply to a real individual."<ref target="n32" type="note">7</ref>
      Foucault further isolates a particular author-function which I would like to appeal to in this
      context, citing Freud and Marx as exemplars: <hi rend="i">viz</hi>, authors who are not just
      the "authors" of their own works, but authors who define the possibilities of
      producing other works, including the rules that govern those works. Such authors can be seen
      as "founders of discursivity" in Foucault’s terminology, in that they define
      or initiate a discursive practice or a field of discursivity. The task they leave for
      subsequent practitioners of discourse is thus either extremely simple (to continue within the
      conspicuous limits of the founding discourse) or extremely difficult: to struggle at the
      necessary task of transforming the discursive practice itself, while the power of that
      practice continues to define the possibilities of what can be said as nothing more than
      variable functions of the originating discursivity itself. The point to be made from this is
      that the field of discursivity founded by Freud, and his own discursive practice, are both
      thoroughly and directly counter to prophecy and prescription, and to the author-function that
      George would have had him assume—contrary not as mere matters of style and temperament,
      but as the essential dimension of sound interpretive practice itself. <note id="n31"><hi rend="s">6</hi> I find it hard to avoid here the image of Mr. Huffcap (who "would kick
       the bottom of the Pulpit out, with Passion, would tear off the sleeve of his Gown. &amp; set
       his wig on fire &amp; throw it at the people hed cry &amp; stamp &amp; kick &amp; sweat
       and all for the good of their souls") or of Quid ("I will fall into such a passion

          <p>What then of George’s assumption that the Truth is immediately available to Blake,
      for whom Milton’s "three major mistakes" turn out to be "relatively
      minor but debilitating" and can readily be cured, producing a Milton who is a "giant
      striding the mountains of Blake’s imaginative universe, afire with sexual and
      intellectual energy" (69)? For George the "readings" that Blake’s poems
      "invite are as theological as they are poetic" (147). She discovers Blake’s
      "theological" Truth in a process of reading that ignores distinctions of voice and
      dramatic context and "hears" Blake’s voice as the voice of Truth speaking
      through Oothoon, through the voice of the Devil—wherever the longed-for message can be
      found. Freud was too old and too sick to be up to the job (220), but Blake, who "knew
      everything about everything" (17) and seemingly had no difficulties or self-doubts, was
      easily able to complete the job begun and botched by Freud, the job of discovering and
      announcing the Truth. The Truth, of course, is that art as a realm of freedom can structure or
      restructure reality according to polymorphously perverse desire, realizing total sexual
      fulfillment. Genital sex, which chains us to reproduction, can be transcended by an indulgence
      in the full range of sexual acts, and the joys of sex will turn out to be intellectual (not
      "natural," for "nature" is evil for Blake, and a stumbling-block for
      Freud) as we all, like Ololon, are "consumed and fulfilled in the orgasmic fires of
      intellect" (181). Freed from genitality, sexuality becomes "expressive of what Blake
      thought the highest in humankind—liberty, inspiration, imaginative freedom, art"
       (180).<ref target="n33" type="note">8</ref><note id="n33"><hi rend="s">8</hi> Cf. Leopold Damrosch’s remark: "The solution is
       constantly announced by Blakeans: abolish secrecy, improve sensual enjoyment, dispense with
       jealousy and indulge in Oothoon’s ‘lovely copulation.’ But
       Blake’s closest affinity with Freud lies in his deep appreciation of the difficulty of
       doing this" (<hi rend="i">Symbol and Truth in Blake’s Myth</hi> [Princeton:
       Princeton University Press, 1980], p. 216).</note></p>
          <p>If this new and revolutionary truth sounds familiar, it is because the Freud in these pages
      is the "American Freud" of Marcuse, N. O. Brown, and the early Reich (before his
      "increasingly narrow and eventually monomaniac focus" [19]). These are
      George’s "major revisionists" (18) of Freud, operating within a liberated
      discursivity that in her view is properly prophetic and prescriptive. Like Blake, they have
      transcended Freud’s failure to envision "art as a way out of the closed
      system" or to embrace "art as an escape from determinism" (220, 228). We are
      thus left with a pathetic view of Freud as a sick, old Jew dying of throat cancer in
      Nazi-occupied Vienna, not realizing that if he had chosen to be a "prophet" rather
      than an "analyst" he could have escaped the determinism of his environment. We
      should "understand Freud’s pessimism, and love him for the modicum of hope and
      vision he retained," but to avoid his fate we should embrace art and live in Jerusalem.
      We should become "Blakers" (17) and do what "Blake says" (78); to
      "restore ourselves to mythic stature . . . why not poetically, mythically, imagine an
      unfallen and expansive body that corresponds to our own" (78)? In Blake’s
      "Program" (80) any "adjustment to external reality and capitulation to natural
      limitation" are simply "a waste of time" (80). After all, Blake "knew
      exactly what he was doing" (106), and he "made it perfectly clear" (82).</p>
          <p>There is little in this intertextual venture that had not already been mapped by Blake in
      his anatomy of discourse in <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>, where
      Oothoon shouts "Love! Love! Love! happy happy Love! free as the mountain wind!" and
      Theotormon does not listen. But Oothoon does not listen to Theotormon either, and there is no
      power in her rapturous rhetoric to change him. To equate the voice of Blake with Oothoon alone
      is to continue to misread this most misread of all Blake’s works, and to trivialize the
      energetic exertion of his talent in the continued quest for a poetic form that could change,
      rather than reinforce, the pattern of voices that "impose" on each other without
      ever constituting a discourse that could be called a conversation. Without suggesting that
      they are right in any ultimate sense, I would still urge that the French Freudians have been
      paying Freud more respectful attention than George, who basically uses a limited view of Freud
      as a straw man to set off a transcendent genius in Blake who "knew everything about
      everything."</p>
          <p>I do think that George is right, in her notion that Blake and Freud are profound
      antagonists. But in spite of her proclamation of anticipatory victory for Blake, the battle is
      never fairly engaged, and the power of Freud’s views on the limits of the possibility
      of discourse cannot be overthrown by proclamation. George does at least recognize that
      "Freud’s choice of words was the linguistic <pb id="p16-124" n="124"/>
      representation of his own and his culture’s processes of symbol formation" (217).
      But she engages with the problem as if it were one of "diction" (217) and
      "terminology" (219) on the simple level of the choice of words.<ref target="n34" type="note">9</ref> The work of Laplanche and Pontalis, even after their eight years of
      research, has probably only begun to show the labyrinthine interconnections of concepts,
      extensions, connotations and implications of Freud’s terminology for the conceptual
      organization and practice of psychoanalysis and interpretation.<ref target="n35" type="note">10</ref> The practice of discourse cannot be freed from the processes of representation and
      available meanings that are inscribed in the very structure of linguistic and cultural codes
      by a simple avoidance of "conventional terminology" (227) and "diction,"
      as George seems for the most part to suggest. <note id="n34"><hi rend="s">9</hi> It is
       interesting that, although Freud’s "use of terminology is problematic"
       (219), his main utility is seen as a purveyor of terminology: "Blake needs Freud to
       clarify Blake’s contributions to psychology in accessible terms" (25).</note><note id="n35"><hi rend="s">10</hi> Jean Laplanche and J.-B. Pontalis, <hi rend="i">The
        Language of Psycho-Analysis</hi>, trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith (New York: W. W. Norton,
       1973).</note></p>
          <p>The end of <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> is relevant here: <q> 8. So Fuzon
       call’d all together<lb/> The remaining children of Urizen:<lb/> And they left the
       pendulous earth:<lb/> They called it Egypt &amp; left it. </q> To <hi rend="i">call</hi> it
      Egypt and leave it is not to enter the promised land of fully liberated discourse, but to
      enter a linguistic desert of doubt and despair, where the already-inscribed code constantly
      offers itself as the only path. This is why Los’s task in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
      is described as building "the stubborn structure of the Language, acting
      against/Albion’s melancholy, who must else have been a Dumb despair" (E 181).
      There is one extended moment, in Chapter 6, where George seems to realize and articulate the
      essence of the basic problems which she elsewhere glides over: <q> Blake’s problems
       with portrayals of sexuality and of women, as I see it, are problems of symbol formation that
       express themselves in the limitations of language. . . . Blake’s vision of the human
       was constantly rendered problematic by language. He had to try to speak the literally
       unspeakable. Language and art were his tools for reunification of the Human Form Divine, but
       the images available to him to communicate his vision of the eternal were necessarily drawn
       from the repository of the material and natural world. That world—its images and
       therefore its language—was sexual. Blake wished to portray everything as human, and
       humans in this world are sexual beings. He was thus compelled to express ultimately
       genderless human forms in gendered terms. . . . To accomplish this task, he turned in every
       direction; most of all, to the sexes. Here, where he tried hardest to heal, he was constantly
       confronted with the wound. Sometimes, ironically, he deepened the wound.<lb/> (199-200) </q>
      This passage alone is worth almost the whole of the rest of the book, and I hope that it
      indicates the future direction of George’s efforts.</p>

          <p>T V. F. Brogan’s <hi rend="i">English Versification, 1570-1980</hi> is a welcome
      reference guide that will help students and researchers plow through the overgrown field of
      versification, defined here as the study of the rhythmical elements and structures of poetry.
      In this thick volume, Brogan organizes works on English versification according to theoretical
      subjects such as sound, syntax, and meter. In addition to the clearly outlined table of
      contents, a global appendix, indexes arranged by poet and author, and generous
      cross-references make the guide readily accessible for research into any component of verse
      theory, from particular studies of Blake to general studies of the role of syntax in
      versification.</p>
          <p>The book is valuable not only because of the author’s painstaking efforts of
      organization and consolidation, but also because of his firm grasp of the history of
      versification and of the theoretical importance of linguistics in the field. In his general
      introduction, in the introductions to various subjects, and in the evaluative descriptions of
      many of the works cited, Brogan recognizes and confronts the historical problems of
      versification: imprecise thinking and confused terminology. According to Brogan, this
      theoretical confusion developed because theorists before the twentieth century did not
      understand the place of language in versification. But this understanding is essential, since
      the increased patterning of verse organizes language on a higher level: "Verse-patterning
      is contrived out of—superimposed upon yet also generated inductively from—the
      only available elements, the natural phonological features of each particular language"
      (xix). Brogan’s emphasis on a sound linguistic basis for verse theory informs his
      judgments of particular entries and, in my opinion, gives credence to his evaluations.</p>
          <p>As far as I can tell, too, Brogan includes and fairly evaluates all of the major works in
      versification, from the earliest theorists through the generative metrists of the 1970s. In
      his evaluation of T. S. Omond’s <hi rend="i">English Metrists</hi> (Oxford, 1921),
      Brogan restates the need for a modern evaluative bibliography for versification. Brogan also
      rightly identifies the weakness of George Saintsbury’s influential <hi rend="i">History
       of English Prosody</hi> (3 vols., London, 1906-10) as a complete lack of a consistent theory,
      which makes the book "one of the most extravagant irrelevancies in criticism" even
      though it is "a great monolith of wide and informed reading" (p. 10). Brogan
      outlines major works and schools in modern English verse theory, including those of the
      structural linguists Seymour Chatman and Roger Fowler and the generative metrists Morris
      Halle, S. Jay Keyser, and Paul Kiparsky. He sees Marina Tarlinskaja’s <hi rend="i">English Verse: Theory and History</hi> (The Hague, 1976) as "the most extensive and the
      most important study of English verse-structure produced in this century" (p. 282),
      because Tarlinskaja is comprehensive (dealing with verse from the thirteenth to the nineteenth
      centuries) and thorough (with the aid of a computer inventory of 100,000 lines).</p>
          <p>The major Romantic poets and their interpreters are well represented in <hi rend="i">English
       Versification.</hi> For instance, Brogan summarizes Wordsworth’s comments on meter in
      the 1800 Preface to <hi rend="i">Lyrical Ballads</hi> and Coleridge’s
      "answer" to them in Chapter 18 of the <hi rend="i">Biographia.</hi> In his comments
      on Wordsworth, Brogan could have been more thorough, though. Wordsworth deserves more credit
      as a forward-looking theorist, aware of the psychological effects of meter, not just meter as
      a "mild narcotic" (p. 163) but also meter as a means by which the poet can heighten
      and intensify emotion. In his entry under W. J. B. Owen’s "The Theory of
      Meter" from <hi rend="i">Wordsworth as Critic</hi> (Toronto, 1969), Brogan quotes and
      seems to accept at face value Owen’s comments that "‘the prose parts of
      Wordsworth’s blank verse, especially, appear to gain no advantage from being in
      meter’" (p. 157). Such a questionable statement at least needs to be read
      alongside Wordsworth’s own assertion <pb id="p16-126" n="126"/> in the Preface
      "that of two descriptions either of passions, manners, or characters, each of them
      equally well executed, the one in prose and the other in verse, the verse will be read a
      hundred times where the prose is read once."<ref target="n36" type="note">1</ref> The
      pleasure provided by the meter (in blank verse, the rhymthmical repetition of the iambic
      pattern) may thus interact with and intensify the poetry. <note id="n36"><hi rend="s">1</hi><hi rend="i"> The Prose Works of William Wordsworth</hi>, ed. W. J. B. Owen and Jane
       Worthington Smyser (Oxford: Clarendon, 1974), I, 150.</note></p>
          <p>Blake presents us with more questions than does Wordsworth. His comments on versification
      consist of a few aphorisms, with nothing as systematic even as the paragraphs from the
      Preface. And whereas Wordsworth works within the tradition of accentual-syllabic verse,
      Blake’s poetry does not flow easily into this mainstream. <hi rend="i">English
       Versification</hi> will be useful to the student who wants to investigate the principles
      behind or follow through on hunches about Blake’s versification. Suppose that someone
      has been working on the idea that the rhythmical principle of Blake’s prophecies is
      based on syntactical patterns. Brogan’s descriptions and evaluations of studies written
      on the role of syntax in versification under the category "Syntax and Grammar"
      should direct that person to relevant readings. Another useful category for the Blake
      researcher would be "Visual (Typographic) Structures." Although many of the entries
      deal with modern "concrete poetry" and Renaissance "pattern poetry,"
      insights into both of these could enhance the study of Blake’s composite art.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, a researcher can turn to the index and immediately find a listing of works
      specifically on Blake’s versification or works in which Blake may be mentioned. From
      these entries, the researcher can piece together a historical survey of the writings and
      determine what kinds of things have been written. Brogan summarizes and evaluates some of the
      works, including Alicia Ostriker’s <hi rend="i">Vision and Verse in William Blake</hi>
      (Madison, 1965), the only book-length study of Blake’s versification. Brogan sees
      Ostriker’s book as a "groundbreaking survey" (p. 349) but claims that it is
      methodologically faulty; he rightly implies that the "concrete foundation" (p. 349)
      will have to include a more precise theoretical structure. Other Blake entries include studies
      that mention or begin to investigate the influence of music and the visual arts on
      Blake’s metrical styles. But the big question remains: what principle is behind the
      rhythmical structures of Blake’s poetry? Quantities, syntax, stress, all of the above,
      none of the above? This question and its answers will have to be based on an understanding of
      the history and theory of English versification.</p>
          <p>Brogan’s <hi rend="i">English Versification</hi> can help to strengthen this basis.
      Brogan succeeds in his intentions of offering a single view of the field, of sketching its
      historical contour, and, potentially, of generating new ideas and works about versification in
      the future. Anyone interested in the verse structures of Blake’s—or any
      poet’s—"sweet forms" should hurry to this worthy guide.</p>

          <p>The business of making facsimiles of Blake’s illuminated books has a long and
      fascinating history, beginning with John Camden Hotten’s edition of <hi rend="i">The
       Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> in 1868 and culminating in recent years with the splendid
      work of the William Blake Trust. There are of course many beautiful copies of the illuminated
      books still awaiting appropriate replication, but we seem to have reached a point in Blake
      studies where the reproduction of Blake’s pictorially less impressive works can also
      find an audience. Thanks to R. J. Shroyer and Scholars’ Facsimiles &amp; Reprints, a
      reproduction of the copy of Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Aphorisms on Man</hi> annotated by
      Blake is now available. Since there are at least three typographic editions of the
       annotations,<ref target="n37" type="note">1</ref> the audience for such a work must <pb id="p16-127" n="127"/> be fairly limited. Yet, in the pages of this journal, it is difficult
      to decry such a publication. A facsimile edition certainly recommends itself to dedicated
      Blake scholars. <note id="n37"><hi rend="s">1</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Complete Writings</hi>, ed. Geoffrey Keynes (London: Oxford Univ. Press,
       1966), pp. 65-88; <hi rend="i">The Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>, ed. David V.
       Erdman (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1965), pp. 572-90; <hi rend="i">William
        Blake’s Writings</hi>, ed. G. E. Bentley, Jr. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978), II,
       1350-87. A new edition of Erdman’s text is forthcoming, one which has been carefully
       collated in galley proof against the original volume in the Huntington Library.</note></p>
          <p>Blake apparently annotated his copy of the <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> shortly after its
      publication in 1788. Although the typographic editions of these annotations all reprint the
      parts of Lavater’s text most essential for understanding Blake’s commentary, the
      entire 643 aphorisms have not been reprinted for over a hundred years, and they have never
      before been printed in full in conjunction with Blake’s marginalia. Scholars have long
      recognized the significance of Blake’s responses to Lavater at a crucial early point in
      the development of Blake’s ideas on man, society, and God. The directness and brevity
      of the annotations help to make them capsule distillations of concepts we find more
      expansively and complexly woven through the fabric of Blake’s poetry. For anyone eager
      to produce a facsimile edition of one of Blake’s annotated books, surely
      Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> is a good first choice.</p>
          <p>Shroyer’s twenty-eight page introduction is the best part of this book. He does a
      good job of presenting, in a surprisingly lively manner, essential information about Lavater,
      Henry Fuseli (the translator of the aphorisms and a close friend of their author), and
      bibliographical details concerning the editions of the book and Blake’s annotations.
      These materials are just what is wanted in an introduction to a facsimile edition. Although
      Shroyer’s discussion of Lavater’s work on physiognomy is a bit tangential to
      this edition, it contributes to the historical context in which Shroyer sets the aphorisms.
      The introduction remains strong when it moves into such detailed matters as the question of
      Fuseli’s possible rewritings of Lavater’s work. Fuseli made his translation from
      a now lost manuscript and included some sixty-five aphorisms, by Shroyer’s count, that
      have no "close matches" with the German editions of the <hi rend="i">Regeln</hi> of
      1787 and 1788. Shroyer offers a convincing explanation of how this came about, based on the
      fair assumption that Lavater himself (having caught what Shroyer calls "gnomic
      fever") revised his maxims between the writing of the manuscript he sent to England and
      the publication of the German editions. One of the strengths of the introduction is that
      Shroyer is concerned with Lavater’s works in their own right before he plunges into
      Blake’s annotations.</p>
          <p>In the last few pages of his introduction, Shroyer surveys some of Blake’s more
      significant annotations to Lavater and points out the basic concepts they embody.
      Blake’s long concluding comment is quoted, including seven or eight words thoroughly
      deleted with circular pen strokes in the original. Shroyer’s transcription of this
      deleted passage is identical to Erdman’s text: "&amp; they converse with the
      spirit of God." Bentley’s reconstruction, "&amp; thus are either good or
       Evil,"<ref target="n38" type="note">2</ref> makes a completely different conclusion to
      the passage. The only evidence I can see in the original at the Huntington Library for either
      reading is the pattern of ascenders and descenders not obscured by Blake’s deletion
      lines. These fragmentary pieces of evidence tend to give more support to Bentley’s
      reading than to Erdman’s. I suspect, however, that we will never be sure of any
      reading, unless computer-enhanced photography can give us a definitive answer. <note id="n38"><hi rend="s">2</hi><hi rend="i"> Poetry and Prose of Blake</hi>, ed. Erdman, p. 590; <hi rend="i">Blake’s
        Writings</hi>, ed. Bentley, II, 1386.</note></p>
          <p>Shroyer comments sensibly on the structural and thematic relationships between the Lavater
      annotations and Blake’s other writings of the late 1780s and early 1790s. He also makes
      an interesting suggestion (p. xxiii) that there is a more than accidental similarity between
      the frontispiece that Blake engraved after Fuseli’s design for the English edition of
      the <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> and the frontispiece to <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence.</hi>
      The remarks on Lavater’s presence in <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>
      and Blake’s later poems are less compelling and too brief to be convincing. Shroyer
      emphasizes Lavater’s membership with Swedenborg in the party of repressive moralizers
      scorned by Blake; but we need more evidence for this than Shroyer has room to provide, and
      surely Blake’s possible criticisms of Lavater must be balanced by the numerous
      indications, provided throughout the annotations, of Blake’s sympathies with
      Lavater’s energetic humanism.</p>
          <p>After such a promising introduction, the facsimile itself is a distinct
      disappointment—or, rather, an indistinct disappointment because of the soft-focus
      fuzziness it gives to Blake’s fine and clear penmanship.<ref target="n39" type="note">3</ref> Blake’s copy of the aphorisms is reproduced slightly larger than the
      original. The photographic process used was apparently one of those that register only black
      or white, converting any middle tones in one direction or the other. As a result, a disturbing
      number of Blake’s pen strokes are lost or fragmented into vague rows of dots and
      dashes. The problem here is not merely aesthetic, but textual. <note id="n39"><hi rend="s">3</hi> All comments on the accuracy of the facsimile are based on a comparison between it
       and the original volume in the Huntington Library.</note></p>
          <p>In his introduction Shroyer notes that neither the Keynes nor the Erdman edition is
      "wholly satisfactory" in its rendering of Blake’s underlinings of
      Lavater’s text. He then claims that "this facsimile . . . should go a long way
      toward alerting the student to such problems and suggesting some answers" (p. xvii).
      Unfortunately, this facsimile creates a good many problems and solves few. Indeed, one must
      use the Keynes, Erdman, or Bentley text as a constant guide while attempting to read
      Shroyer’s reproductions. For example, in aphorism no. 3 Blake’s underlining of
      the penultimate line is signalled only by a few easily overlooked dots; the underlining of the
      last line here (and in no. 424) is not indicated at all. In the original, the pen strokes are
      fine but unmistakably clear. Blake’s X next to aphorism no. 21 is reduced to a large T
      and makes it seem as though it were the first letter of the non word, "Tuneasy." The
      X next to the end of no. 619 disappears altogether. Blake wrote two large exclamation points
      following aphorism no. 157. In the facsimile, these become four widely spaced dots that look
      like nothing more than accidental flyspecks. And at the end of no. 309, Blake’s
      question mark becomes a colon. The vertical line in pencil next to no. 285 does not appear at
      all in the facsimile, and the long pencil note on no. 532 is illegible. The word
      "Admirable!" written vertically next to aphorism no. 20 reproduces fairly well, but
      nowhere does Shroyer point out that it is <pb id="p16-128" n="128"/> written in pencil. Nor
      does he identify other annotations in pencil or in a light brown ink quite distinct from the
      black ink of the majority of the annotations. Blake’s editors have attributed some of
      these annotations to a hand other than Blake’s, and surely this is a matter Shroyer
      should have taken up in his introduction. He cannot be held responsible for his
      publisher’s failures in reproducing the original, but even if he had expected high
      quality photographic work he should have realized the necessity for identifying different inks
      and different hands.</p>
          <p>Another difficulty not overcome by the publisher is the presence of annotations very close
      to the spine of the book. Apparently the volume could not be opened wide enough to expose such
      annotations completely to the camera. As a result, it seems as though Blake wrote
      "ellent" next to aphorism no. 40; in the original, "Excellent" is clear
      and fully present. The lengthy annotations in the inner margins of aphorisms nos. 248, 342,
      532, 533, and 605 are converted to odd bits and pieces. Once again, the reader must return to
      typographic texts in order to make sense of the facsimile.</p>
          <p>Professor Shroyer has indicated in correspondence<ref target="n40" type="note">4</ref> that
      the <hi rend="i">Aphorisms on Man</hi> is the first volume in a proposed series of facsimiles
      of Blake’s annotated books. Future volumes will have full transcriptions of the
      annotations. These transcriptions, if accompanied by appropriate notes on such matters as
      differences in ink, should go a long way toward solving some of the problems burdening the <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> facsimile. One can only hope that a solid scholar like Shroyer will
      be better served by his publisher in prospective volumes, and that we can use them with full
      confidence in their accuracy and completeness. As Blake wrote, "He who would do good to
      another, must do it in Minute Particulars." <note id="n40"><hi rend="s">4</hi> Letter

          <p>Blake’s <hi rend="i">The Everlasting Gospel</hi> exists in manuscript form scattered
      through the pages of the <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> in the Department of Manuscripts in the
      British Museum, and in part in the Rosenbach MS; it is usually dated c. 1818. A full treatment
      of the work and the bibliographical and interpretational problems it raises can be found in
      Randel Helms’s essay <hi rend="i">The Genesis of "The Everlasting
       Gospel"</hi> in <hi rend="i">Blake Studies</hi>, 9 (1980), 122-60.</p>
          <p>Joëlle Abitbol and Samuel Tastet’s edition prints the text and Mme.
      Abitbol’s French translation in parallel; it constitutes "Volume I" of a
      series entitled <hi rend="i">Double Same/Double Mème.</hi> Despite the inscription of
      the verso of the title-page, "c Editions G. Keynes—1957," the text used
      adheres to the conjecturally chronological arrangement printed by Bentley; but its adherence
      is limited: Abitbol and Tastet eschew Blake’s capitalization and a fair <pb id="p16-129" n="129"/> proportion of his punctuation, and the passages used are selected
      according to no obvious procedure (there is no mention of the fact that the text is
      selective). The text takes seven of the eleven or twelve sections and rearranges them
      according to no immediately apparent plan, labeling them I-VII; in Keynes’s
      nomenclature, the order of the edition is: Supplementary passage 2, Supplementary passage l,
      i, a,d,e,b,f; in Bentley’s nomenclature (following the Rosenbach MS and attempting a
      chronological realignment), the order is b,c,d,e,j,f,i,l. In any case, there are three
      sections missing, including the short prose passage at the beginning, and one of the two
      "Was Jesus Humble?" passages (p. 52 in the <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi>).</p>
          <p>The text and illustrations are printed in an unattractive ochre-colored ink, and italics are
      used for quotations; the French text is aligned to the right-hand margin, which makes reading
      difficult. The translation does not attempt to reproduce Blake’s irregular four-foot
      iambic line, and so loses the headlong momentum of the invective of the poem; it also does not
      attempt the paired rhymes of the original, although rhyming couplets seem to occasionally slip
      into the French translation as if by chance (e.g., lines 3-4, 5-6 of the first section). The
      final two-line section is particularly inadequately translated: "Je suis certain que
      Jésus ne ferait pas cela, / A un Anglais ou à un Juif" distorts the meaning
      of "I am sure this Jesus will not do, / Either for Englishman or Jew"—the
      addition of "cela" loses the idiomatic sense of the line and introduces all sorts of
      new (and unwanted) meanings.</p>
          <p>The editors of this text include a quotation from Revelation 14:6, "and I saw another
      angel fly in the midst of Heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell
      on the earth . . . "; this may be the source of Blake’s title for what is
      admittedly a very fragmentary and obscure work, but it need not necessarily be so, and has no
      further referential connection with the poem. Its inclusion adds nothing more than an
      additional disruptive perspective.</p>
          <p>Blake’s pen and watercolor drawing <hi rend="i">The Blasphemer</hi> (Tate Gallery
      5195; Butlin 446, dated c. 1800) is reproduced on the cover of the publication; on the back it
      is reproduced in reverse (probably to highlight the title of the series), an unattractive
      proceeding under any circumstances; coarse-grained ochre reproductions of details from the
      watercolor appear inside the text, again with a laterally-reversed copy of the image on the
      facing page. <hi rend="i">The Blasphemer</hi> is usually taken to represent the stoning to
      death of the Israelite woman’s son who blasphemed the name of the Lord, Leviticus 24:23
      (Butlin 446), although William Rossetti retitled it <hi rend="i">The Stoning of Achan</hi>,
      after Joshua 7:1, 18-25; the relationship of this subject (or these subjects) to the text in
      question is problematical if not dubious—Blake’s poem is a headlong invective
      against a particularly milk-and-water conception of Christ, and the stoning of a tied, tensed
      figure by fierce-eyed elders bears little relation to this. Among the bibliographical data of
      the edition, "Gravure de couverture de William Blake" is translated as "Design
      cover of William Blake"—as if attempting to establish a connection.</p>
          <p>This is a most unattractive edition of a Blake work, and also a wasted opportunity; such
      publication of a single work draws the attention to a fragment of Blake’s oeuvre which
      it inevitably loses when buried amid the bulk of a complete edition, and it is a pity that the
      work could not have been done with greater care and greater accuracy and attention to
      detail.</p>

            <p>"Young was fortunate. He seems almost the only poet who has had his mere metaphors
       illustrated and made corporeal."<ref target="n41" type="note">1</ref> —Blake
       enthusiasts are fond of the idea that Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> are
       remembered today mostly on account of their having been illustrated by their worshipped hero.
       It is to be questioned, however, whether Blake himself would be remembered today had he left
       behind nothing but this particular series of watercolors and engravings which, with respect
       to quantity, is his largest. <note id="n41"><hi rend="s">1</hi> [Edward Bulwer-Lytton],

            <p>Few of Blake’s nineteenth-century commentators had direct access to the 537
       watercolor drawings, and thus could only judge the artist’s <hi rend="i">Night
        Thoughts</hi> designs (<hi rend="i">NT</hi>) from the forty-three engravings in
       Edwards’ edition of 1797. These were criticized as being "somewhat
       uninteresting." "In Blake’s conceptions it is a hit or a miss," and,
       Gilchrist continues, "the miss is a wide one," especially if it comes to the
       illustrations for Young’s poem. "There is a monotony of subject, of treatment, of
       handling the graver even. . . . There is little or no individuality in his faces, if more in
       his forms. Typical forms and faces, abstract impersonations, are used to express his meaning.
       Everything,—figures, landscape, costume, accessory,—is reduced to its elemental
       shape, its simplest guise. . . ."<ref target="n42" type="note">2</ref> Thus the <hi rend="i">NT</hi> designs prompted one of the harshest critiques of Blake’s artistic
       output in Gilchrist’s biography. Nowadays, few would subscribe to the normative
       aesthetics which loom large behind such nineteenth-century views; and yet, even the most
       cautious value judgments, based on a critical and intimate knowledge of Blake’s entire
       work as a visual artist and taking only his own creative possibilities as a standard, will
       necessarily have to admit certain deficiencies—of which monotonous reduplication
       isn’t the least—that prevent the <hi rend="i">NT</hi> watercolors from ranking
       high among Blake’s masterpieces.<ref target="n43" type="note">3</ref><note id="n42"><hi rend="s">2</hi> Alexander Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Life of William

        "so completely inferior [to the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> illustrations] that they had no
        attractions." See the <hi rend="i">Autobiographical Notes of the Life of William Bell
         Scott</hi>, ed. W. Minto, vol. 1 (London, 1892), p. 21, here quoted from <hi rend="i">Blake
         Records</hi>, p. 193.</note><note id="n43"><hi rend="s">3</hi> Bindman’s discussion of the series in his <hi rend="i">Blake as an Artist</hi> (Oxford: Phaidon, 1977), pp. 109-12, represents an attempt
        to weigh fairly Blake’s achievement against the "staleness and repetition"
        which are considered as an "inevitable" effect of the very nature of
        Edwards’s commission.</note></p>
            <p>This and the sheer number of the designs may explain why the <hi rend="i">NT</hi>
       illustrations had to wait for reproduction longer than any other of Blake’s works. The
       need for a complete edition of these watercolors which represent approximately a fifth of the
       artist’s surviving designs, was first advocated in Hershel Margoliouth’s
       pioneering article of 1954: "How can the large company of students of Blake function
       adequately when [by 1954] 457 drawings, most of his work for a year and a half of the prime
       of his life, have never been reproduced?"<ref target="n44" type="note">4</ref> Little
       happened, and in 1969 Morton Paley still had to complain that the <hi rend="i">NT</hi>
       designs "have remained the least known as well as the largest of Blake’s sets of
       designs," for which "no detailed consideration of their symbolism, thematic
       structure, and meaning has yet been published."<ref target="n45" type="note">5</ref>
       Then, in the same year, readers of the second edition of Erdman’s <hi rend="i">Prophet
        Against Empire</hi> were informed that "only in the late 1960’s did extensive
       scholarly study of the Blake water colors begin, as Clarendon Press undertook to publish a
       multi-volume edition of the whole series (with commentary by John Grant, Michael Tolley, and
        <pb id="p16-131" n="131"/> Edward Rose).’’<ref target="n46" type="note">6</ref> Research for this edition had started as early as 1963-1964 (see p. x), but even
       the photographic reproductions, now under review, had to wait for their publication yet
       another ten years following Erdman’s announcement. It is only natural if with this
       elapse of time the highest possible expectations were raised. <note id="n44"><hi rend="s">4</hi> Hershel M. Margoliouth, "Blake’s Drawings for Young’s

            <p>These great expectations, I am afraid, are not fulfilled by the two enormous folio-sized
       volumes now published. Besides a foreword by Erdman who acted as coordinating editor, the
       first volume contains an introduction of some eighty pages, a bibliographic checklist of
       previous studies of the <hi rend="i">NT</hi> illustrations, and reproductions 1-263. These
       are followed in the second volume by reproductions from <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 264-537, and
       thus the modern edition exactly reflects the arrangement of the original water colors which
       were bound accordingly in two volumes for their first owner, the book dealer and publisher
       Richard Edwards. To the 537 halftone reproductions are added in the second volume a selection
       of seventy-eight designs which are reproduced in color, as well as eight specimen color
       plates from colored copies of the engravings; also reproduced are sixty-two proofs and the
       1797 edition in its entirety (vii+95+[2]pp.).</p>

                <hi rend="b">The Monochrome Plates</hi>
              </title>
            </head>
            <p>I take it for granted that, with a total of 801 plates (including figures in the text,
       which are all connected with Blake’s <hi rend="i">NT</hi>), and presenting for the
       first time all the known materials related to one of Blake’s major commissions,
       including the reproductions of virtually hundreds of designs which have hitherto not been
       accessible except to students at the British Museum Print Room, the importance and value of
       such an edition is self-evident to anyone who is seriously interested in Blake’s work.
       This is merely the quantitative aspect, however. The reproductions being the <hi rend="i">raison d’être</hi> and, no doubt, the reason for so high a retail price of
       these volumes, it is their quality which has to be considered first.</p>
            <p>Each of the 537 monochrome plates measures c. 29.5 × 22.7 cm.; this still means a
       reduction by approximately 30% from the originals (c. 42 × 32.5 cm.). The latter were
       executed on Whatman drawing paper which supplied the water colorist with an almost absolute,
       though unbleached, white for his ground. Its effect might have been imitated in the
       reproductions if a similar make of printing paper as, e.g., that used for the plates in
       Keynes’ <hi rend="i">Blake Studies</hi>, had been decided upon.<ref target="n47" type="note">7</ref> Alas, it was not, and the choice of a somewhat creamy, toned paper for
       the printing of the pictures marks the second step away from the originals. The consequences
       of this decision for a printing paper which adds to the reproductions a color of its own are
       felt most strongly where the color plates are concerned. The black and white reproductions,
       however, may seem satisfactory at first sight. Only when compared with the originals or even
       with the results that were achieved in the 1927 facsimile does it become evident how much
       detail is lost in them.<ref target="n48" type="note">8</ref> Equally important is the fact
       that there is no uniformity of tonal values in the monochrome reproductions.<ref target="n49" type="note">9</ref> Similar if not identical washes of a bright blue which in the
       watercolors have been employed to indicate the sunlit sky, reproduce as a faint
       gray—that is, just as one would expect—in the majority of the plates (see e.g.
       reprod. from <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 7, 11, 17, 21, etc.). Then there are instances, however,
       where a similar cerulean blue or a light gray wash in the original design becomes, in the
       reproduction, approaching night or sometimes even a complete darkness (see e.g. reprod. from
        <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 146, 154, 169, 175, 207, 227, 236, 238, 242, etc.). What is reproduced
       by equally compact areas in the halftone screen is thus not necessarily in keeping with areas
       of corresponding brightness or darkness in the watercolors. In general, the contrast between
       light and dark areas is much stronger in the black and white reproductions than in the
       designs themselves, and much detail gets lost together with Blake’s richer modulation
       of colors.<ref target="n50" type="note">10</ref> This certainly need not be. The ten years
       this publication has been in preparation surely would have allowed for the production of a
       more homogeneous set of photographs and its adequate printing. Apart from these
       strictures—and especially if compared with the color plates—the monochrome
       reproductions of <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 1-537 serve their major purpose well enough. They will
       act as a valuable aid to memory for all those who have seen the originals, and—as a
       ‘‘simile’’ of the ‘‘figures, landscape, costume,
       accessory’’ of Blake’s designs—they will allow for iconographic
       research as well as, say, for a study of recurrent motifs among Blake’s figures. <note id="n47"><hi rend="s">7</hi> See Geoffrey Keynes, <hi rend="i">Blake Studies</hi>, 2nd enl.
        ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971). It needs no stressing, I suppose, that the use of
        glossy coated paper would have produced even worse results; also, the choice of paper may
        well have been dictated by the economics of modern book production outside the control of
        the editors.</note><note id="n48"><hi rend="s">8</hi> In the Clarendon edition one almost has to know beforehand
        about, for example, the presence of the frightened and the sleeping warrior in the
        resurrection scene of <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 264; otherwise one will be at pains to interpret
        the fragmentary traces of their outlines in the monochrome reproduction. The same design in
        Geoffrey Keynes, ed., <hi rend="i">William Blake: Illustrations to Young’s
         ‘Night Thoughts’</hi> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, for the
        Fogg Museum of Art, 1927) has all the detail reproduced to perfection. Yet of course the
        Fogg publication as well as the set of five plates from the <hi rend="i">NT</hi> water
        colors included in Keynes’ <hi rend="i">Blake Studies</hi> (pls. 15-19) were
        reproduced by the collotype process, a printing technique which progress has by now almost
        put beyond price for publishers and their customers.</note><note id="n49"><hi rend="s">9</hi> I take it for granted that the editors did not attempt to
        create an independent work of art, but wanted to supply us with the most reliable
        "copy" that is possible; consequently I hope that no one will refer me to what
        Blake had to say about uniformity and "intermeasurability," or to Morris
        Eaves’ excellent article on the "Artistic Machine" (<hi rend="i">PMLA</hi>,
        92 [1977], 903-27).</note><note id="n50"><hi rend="s">10</hi> The example of <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 264 has been quoted
        above; for further evidence I may refer to Lorenzo-Belshazzar’s left arm in <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 60, which in the reproduction is almost lost from sight under heavy
        blackish shading; this, as well as the upper part of the warning spirit’s left arm,
        are shaded with a gray wash but are perfectly clear in the original water color. Because of
        this kind of unreliability the reproductions—if not checked against the
        originals—may easily lend themselves to over-interpretation. <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 154
        illustrates the lines "Till One [i.e. Death] calls Him, who varies not his Call, / But
        holds him [i.e. Earth’s happiest Man] fast, in Chains of Darkness bound." Blake
        shows the Urizenic figure of Death, crouching behind his chained victim. On the basis of the
        reproduction one might feel tempted to describe the setting of this scene as a cave, similar
        to those in <hi rend="i">Gates</hi> 3, or <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> 9—the watercolor,
        however, simply has unmodulated gray washes for a background screen which do not indicate
        any sort of measurable space or recession at all.</note></p>
            <p>It is this main section of the edition which also comes closest to keeping up with its
       claim to be ‘‘a necessary response to the wide and increasing modern interest
       in all of Blake’s works and to the exacting inclusiveness of a critical scholarship
       which demands easy access and frequent reference to the artist’s entire <hi rend="i">oeuvre</hi>’’ (p. vii). And indeed, as regards ‘‘easy
       access,’’ the Clarendon edition has one real advantage even over the originals
       at the British Museum. The latter are mounted in an annoying and disadvantageous manner
       between heavy perspex screens which, however, proved to be necessary for their protection.
       Also, it takes approximately a week to go through the whole series box by box at the Print
       Room, and this does not allow for careful examination of more than a small portion of the
       watercolors. Usually students are asked to have only one box on their table at a time, and in
       consequence it becomes extremely wearisome to both staff and visitor if one wants to compare
       a design from Night VIII with another from Night II, and so on. For a wide range of possible
       questions such comparison has been enormously facilitated by the publication of the <hi rend="i">Complete Edition.</hi></p>

                <hi rend="b">The Color Plates</hi>
              </title>
            </head>
            <p>In the same large format as the monochrome plates, almost 15% of the watercolors are
       reproduced for a second time in ‘‘full colour.’’ For all those
       who once had a chance to study the originals, this will be the most disappointing part of the
       present publication. Many readers are likely to disagree with me if I say that ten
       high-quality color plates, equal to those in Keynes’s 1927 edition, would have <pb id="p16-132" n="132"/> done more for our understanding of Blake’s coloring in the <hi rend="i">NT</hi> series than such a ‘‘large proportion of full-colour
       plates’’ (p. vii) of a more than questionable standard. It is indeed much
       easier to demonstrate the range of possibilities in color composition that Blake made use of
       in this series by a large number of examples. But what—except misleading—are
       all these examples good for if only a small portion of the seventy-eight color reproductions
       gives at least a fair impression of what the originals look like? And yet this is an idle
       question. We will have to work with the edition as it is, and all that is to be done <hi rend="i">post festum</hi> is to list the major discrepancies between the original designs
       and their reproductions. This may serve as a warning and—at best—as a
       corrective for those who are forced to base their judgment on what is to be gleaned from the
       present publication.</p>
            <p>Technically speaking, Blake’s <hi rend="i">NT</hi> designs are basically pen and ink
       drawings which have been tinted with watercolors. These are merely added to outline drawings,
       indicating once more that color is certainly not at the structural and conceptual center of
       Blake’s artistic work. Yet secondary importance remains importance still, and it is
       evident even from such miserable reproductions that the coloring is essential for elucidating
       the idea which is captured in the drawing.</p>
            <p>The range of colors used by Blake for his <hi rend="i">NT</hi> illustrations is in itself
       restricted. First there is a dominance of bright blues, yellows and greens for the early
       Nights. Though rose color is frequently employed, genuine red is relatively rare except for
       being used in the carnation. From Night VII onwards, Blake’s palette darkens
       considerably; there are stronger contrasts between light and dark areas in the designs which
       now also include much larger quantities of red.<ref target="n51" type="note">11</ref> Parts
       of the picture area are often left untouched so that the white of the paper may figure as
       clouds in a sky background or may represent light. Due to the toned paper employed for their
       printing, this white has mostly been lost in the color reproductions. There it is often
       transferred into a smudgy pink or ochre, giving the impression of heavy foxing or of some
       strange underpainting which is alien to the originals (see reprod. from <hi rend="i">NT</hi>
       151). Blake’s gray and black here tend to reproduce as a dark and dense brown, or are
       changed to a pale or a dark umber (see reprod. from <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 78, 125, 156, 166,
       284, 324, 344, 410, 415, 446, 466). Gray may even be deformed into a dark mauve (see reprod.
       from <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 34). The flesh colors, male and female, either lose most of their
       vivid aspects (see reprod. from <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 6, 156, etc.), or, to the contrary, show
       too much of pink (see reprod. from <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 117). The brilliance and intensity of
       the varied hues of green have suffered most; they are lost almost completely in the
       reproduction from <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 30, they are much darkened in the reproduction from
        <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 111, or they are boiled down and reduced to a common denominator as in
       the reproductions from <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 6, 24, 36, 78, 143, 158, 234, 296, 430, and 442.
       Brown—though of subordinate importance, if present at all in the
       watercolors—often gains dominance in the reproductions (for examples of the
       introduction of brown which is absent from the original design and for a brownish overall
       tinge akin to a nineteenth-century gallery varnish, see reprod. from <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 17,
       68, 312, 338, 378, 410, 446). The bright, translucent washes of blue and yellow are strongly
       affected by the color of the ‘‘ground,’’ the creamy tinge of the
       printing paper; they lose much of their brilliance and depth, and in some places in the
       reproductions yellow or blue are omitted altogether (see especially reprod. from <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 34, 91, 143, 345, 408). Yellow may reproduce as an almost golden brown, as beige or
       ochre (see reprod. from <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 111 and 284); that the more specific and often
       used quality of lemon loses its tendency towards bright green, but may gain a tendency
       towards yolk of egg, gold, or orange is to be seen in other examples (see reprod. from <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 6, 135, 170, 203, 287, 408). Blake’s reds, ranging from carmine and
       cinnabar to salmon color, participate in the general loss of intensity and variety of hues
       which sadly characterizes the color plates. They reproduce too dark and dense, and they are
       thus brought close to a reddish brown which is lacking from the originals (see reprod. from
        <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 107, 125, 156, 345). <note id="n51"><hi rend="s">11</hi> On p. 10 of
        the introduction the editors observe that there "are no great differences in style from
        Night the First to Night the Ninth; the increasing frequency of stronger hues in the later
        Nights seems calculatedly dramatic."</note></p>
            <p>If just one color comes off wrong from a reproduction, this causes a distortion in the
       whole of the color composition which is unmendable. So in the end we are left with only a
       small porportion of full-color plates that actually meet with the requirements of a critical
       scholarship. (For the few good ones see reprod. from <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 87, 164, 170 [good
       for the greens], 339, 352, 361, 471.) And it is no real consolation that the remaining plates
       in the second volume are those which are the most satisfactory. At approximately 70% of the
       original size they reproduce the proofs, the finished engravings, and the complete text of
       the printed edition of 1797. The originals in this case being in a monochrome medium
       themselves, the reproduction must have caused comparatively few problems for the printer.</p>

                <hi rend="b">The Introductory Essay</hi>
              </title>
            </head>
            <p>Until the publication of the volumes of commentary, the scholarly apparatus of the <hi rend="i">Complete Edition</hi> of Blake’s <hi rend="i">NT</hi> illustrations is
       limited to the captions, a foreword, and an introductory essay. The captions identify the
       watercolors by their standardized numbers (<hi rend="i">NT</hi> 1-537).<ref target="n52" type="note">12</ref> They also cite the page number for the respective Night, and the
       numbers of the lines which were illustrated by Blake. A set of symbols serves to distinguish
       the markings of lines, and if a design has been engraved for the 1797 edition, a reference to
       the engraving is included as well. Erdman’s foreword, dated August 1977, is
       interesting mostly as an advertisement for the forthcoming volumes of commentary. Readers are
       told that the ‘‘purpose and uses of a commentary will be made manifest when it
       appears,’’ and are asked (in 1977, or in 1980?) their ‘‘patience
       for another year or two’’ (p. vii). There can be no arguing about that. The
       coordinating editor’s claim, however, ‘‘that commentary is even more
       necessary for the apparently simple pictures than for those where difficulty and irony
       insistently confront us’’ (p. viii), is a paradox which in due time will have
       to be put to the proof. <note id="n52"><hi rend="s">12</hi> This system of identification has
        been in general use from the late 1960s onwards; it now has also been adopted for the brief
        entries for each design in Martin Butlin, <hi rend="i">The Paintings and Drawings of William
         Blake</hi>, vol. 1 (New Haven, Conn. and London: Yale University Press, for the Paul Mellon
        Center for Studies in British Art, 1981), no. 330, pp. 178-253. The system for numbering the
        water colors and the engravings, each by a series straight through from <hi rend="i">NT</hi>
        1 to <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 537, and from 1E to 43E, and their combined use in references like
         <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 1(31E), or 31E(<hi rend="i">NT</hi> 1) respectively, is explained on
        p. xv.</note></p>
            <pb id="p16-133" n="133"/>
            <p>Finally, there is the introduction which—apart from offering a valid and useful
       compilation of all the external sources and data connected with Blake’s <hi rend="i">NT</hi> project—makes an independent contribution to our knowledge of the history
       and development of these designs. In the first of the five chapters of this essay, the
       editors describe the "Occasion" which led to the production of the watercolors.
       They deal with the neglect of Young’s poem and Blake’s illustrations in
       twentieth-century scholarship, and claim that today Young may be rehabilitated if only read
       through these illuminations of his poetry (see p. 3). Then, quoting from the Farington Diary,
       Ann Flaxman’s letters, the Prospectus, and the Advertisement for the 1797 edition, the
       outward circumstances of Edwards’s commission are described.<ref target="n53" type="note">13</ref> Though there is some truly Blakean bias, and even some twisting of the
        evidence,<ref target="n54" type="note">14</ref> these pages are on the whole a sound
       recapitulation of all that is presently known about the history of the production of the
       watercolors, and of Blake’s relations with Edwards. For the first time, the editors
       offer a balanced account of the publisher’s role and his "personal enthusiasm for
       the project" (p. 5). Richard Edwards emerges almost triumphantly as a sort of
       anti-Cromek, and this view is more convincing to me than Bentley’s earlier stance, who
       could see in the Advertisement nothing but "a strange piece of puffing."<ref target="n55" type="note">15</ref><note id="n53"><hi rend="s">13</hi> No new documentary evidence seems to have surfaced; thus,

        from Bentley’s <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, passim. The letters from Ann Flaxman,
        however, previously believed to have been written some time in 1797, are now convincingly
        predated c. "16 March 1796" (see p. 4 and p. 85, n. 4).</note><note id="n54"><hi rend="s">14</hi> The motive here seems to be simply to put Blake in the
        most favorable light when, e.g., Farington is scorned as "an unsuccessful
        painter," just because he "was an unsympathetic witness" (p. 4) who did not
        appreciate Blake’s work. As secretary to the Royal Academy Farington was socially
        much more successful than Blake himself, and some arguments concerning Farington’s
        paintings are required to justify such a rash verdict which—in any case—will
        remain an unnecessary idiosyncrasy and rather out of place in this context. Also, we cannot
        know whether or not "Farington made nonsense of what must have been an effort by Fuseli
        to explain what was [positively] special about Blake’s use of imagination" (p.
        4). It <hi rend="i">must</hi> not; after all, Fuseli on the very same occasion is reported
        saying that "Blake has something of madness abt. him." This sentence, however, is
        not quoted by Grant, Rose, and Tolley. See <hi rend="i">The Diary of Joseph Farington</hi>,

        University Press, for the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, 1978), p. 589.

            <p>As regards the "Reception of the Engraved Edition," it remains conjectural
       whether or not it really "had a considerable sale" (p. 7). The authors themselves
       think it "probable" that the print run was limited to no more than 200 copies, and
       even if these were actually sold within the next ten years, it is rather an exaggeration to
       say the sale had been "considerable."<ref target="n56" type="note">16</ref> The
       following pages are occupied by an account of the history and ownerships of the watercolors
       from the time of their completion onwards (pp. 7-8). The editors’ sources for these

       Keynes’s <hi rend="i">Blake Studies.</hi><note id="n56"><hi rend="s">16</hi> I ought to point out, however, that the first printing of

        (New York: NYPL, 1964), pp. 54-56.</note></p>
            <p>Though including sections on the "Completion of the Series" and "A
       Frontispiece for Each Volume," the chapter on the "Preparation and Production"
       of the 537 watercolors is merely 3 1/2 pages long (pp. 10-13). These contain information on
       the Whatman drawing paper which was employed by the artist, on the inlaying and framing of
       the pages of Young’s text, on the masking of the latter before application of the
       colors, on the markings of lines which were to serve as a starting point for the
       illustrations, on Blake’s processes from underdrawing to coloring, and on the <hi rend="i">pentimenti</hi> and the problem of the preliminary sketches. Grant, Rose, and
       Tolley assume the possibility that at least some of the water colors were finished "only
       while [Blake was] making the plates," and that "he may easily be supposed to have
       given the final touches to some of them [i.e. the water color designs] only in order to
       perfect them as a complete series" (p. 11) even after any view of publishing a sequel to
       the 1797 edition of Nights I-IV had ceased to exist. This I believe to be particularly
       important because previously the <hi rend="i">NT</hi> water colors have often been considered
       as mere preparatory drawings for the engravings. For their first owner, however, they may
       well have held the status of an independent and self-sufficient work of art. The engravings
       then, which were to publish only a selection of the entire series of designs (be it 150, or
       even 200 plates), would have to be placed rather with the large reproductive engravings after
       the paintings from Boydell’s Shakespeare Gallery, or those initially planned by Fuseli
       for his Milton Gallery,<ref target="n57" type="note">17</ref> than to be considered the sole
       and <hi rend="i">prima causa</hi> for Blake’s sequence of the 537 water colors. There
       was of course a strong economic interest behind all the Gallery schemes of the day. The point
       I want to make, however, is that this economic interest in the 1790s was ideologically linked
       with the idea of establishing a British school of history painting, and that both Blake and
       Edwards may have thought of the <hi rend="i">NT</hi> designs as their personal contribution
       to its realization. To prepare a series of engravings, pencil drawings or monochrome wash
       drawings would have been completely sufficient, and there certainly would have been no need
       for mounting the pages of a precious copy of Young’s <hi rend="i">NT</hi> which later
       was said to have been the author’s own (see pp. 8 and 9). The careful outlining and
       coloring of these designs then may well accord to an additional, or rather the first part of
       Edwards’ commission, comparable only to that from Flaxman for the similar Gray
        series.<ref target="n58" type="note">18</ref> This view is also corroborated by what the
       authors have to report about the reception of the watercolors which in "any event . . .
       indicates considerable respect on Edwards’s part for both the poetry of Young, and the
       drawings of Blake" (p. 11).<ref target="n59" type="note">19</ref><note id="n57"><hi rend="s">17</hi> For Fuseli’s plan to have his Milton paintings

        watercolors differ markedly from the <hi rend="i">NT</hi> designs in both their often
        sketchlike style of drawing and their often unfinished coloring.</note><note id="n59"><hi rend="s">19</hi> Though David Erdman describes the series as a "vast
        gallery of illuminative art" (p. vii), and though the editors seem to be aware of some
        sort of connection between the <hi rend="i">NT</hi> designs and the various Shakespeare and
        Milton galleries (see p. 7), they prefer the view that the "decision to prepare the
        watercolours as a self-sufficient <hi rend="i">opus</hi>" (p. 12) was an afterthought
        and dates from a later period than the original commission.</note></p>
            <p>Speculations about the designing and the function of <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 1 (31E) and about
       Edwards’ printing schedule (pp. 12-13) lead on to the next section. This is devoted to
       the "Engravings," and here we learn about the difficulties with correct positioning
       of the plates and overprinting of the text panels in the 1797 edition (pp. 13-14), problems
       which in a few cases even made a "cropping of figures" unavoidable, "as in 3E
        (<hi rend="i">NT</hi> 14), for example" (p. 14). The penciled page numbers on some of
       the so-called "private proofs" from the collection of Philip Hofer are interpreted
       as an unsuccessful attempt to cope with those problems caused by "the tight economy of
       space required by the printed pages of text" (p. 14). Then, the often complicated
       development of the forty-three designs that were engraved for the edition of 1797 is
       presented in a "Table of Engraved Designs" (pp. 17-35). With the private proofs
       included which "only now [have been] made available for study" (p. 15), this
       account of all the variant states supplements and up-dates Easson and Essick’s
       bibliographical notes for the same set of engravings.<ref target="n60" type="note">20</ref>
       The publication of the Hofer private proofs with their remarques certainly adds a new facet
       to what we know about Blake as print maker, and it is only in a few cases that the usefulness
       of this "Table" may be lessened by some minor descriptive errors.<ref target="n61" type="note">21</ref><note id="n60"><hi rend="s">20</hi> See Roger R. Easson and Robert N. Essick, <hi rend="i">William Blake: Book Illustrator</hi>, vol. 1 (Normal, Ill.: American Blake Foundation,
        1972), pp. 15-27. Professors Rose, Tolley, and Grant also relied largely on Easson and
        Essick’s account of the printing process (see pp. 88, n. 29 and 89, n. 43); with
        respect to the size of the printing paper the information G. E. Bentley, Jr.,
        "Young’s ‘Night Thoughts’ (London: R. Edwards, 1797): A New
        Unillustrated State," <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, 14 (1980), 35, will now have to be taken
        into consideration.</note><note id="n61"><hi rend="s">21</hi> Thus, I see simply parallel lines, but no
        "cross-hatching in the shadow below Death’s toes" (p. 19) in 4E; and it is
        certainly wrong to describe the king "under the outstretched foot of Death" in <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 20 as having been "decapitated" (p. 19). In the watercolor the
        figure’s head is merely seen foreshortened and from below so that only the outline of
        the king’s chin shows; much the same contour is employed for a second time in <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 20 for the head of the other king who is seen from above. Obviously, Blake
        made use of the device of counter-, or mirror-images, a practice well known from
        Quattrocento paintings (see, e.g., the archers in the 1475 San Sebastiano altarpiece at the
        National Gallery in London [inv. no. 292], which is traditionally attributed to Antonio and
        Piero del Pollaiuolo). Blake’s departure from his water color design in the final
        engraving (5E) does not "reflect an inclination toward less provocative designs"
        (p. 13), but rather an attempt to make his image more easily recognizable in all its
        details. The editors’ fantastic interpretation of the water color proves that he was
        right in this decision.</note></p>
            <p>The chapter on "The Frontispieces" (<hi rend="i">NT</hi> 1 and 264) opens with a
       consideration of "the symbolic dramatic effect achieved by the placing of the vision of
       the Rising Christ in the fourth title-page of the engraved edition" (p. 35). Then, the
       title pages supplied for each of the four Nights in the 1797 edition are discussed as a
       sequence of designs, one relating to the others. From the following interpretation of the
       function of <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 1 and <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 264 <pb id="p16-134" n="134"/> we
       can get a foretaste of what is to be expected from the commentary. "One of the purposes
       of our commentary will be to make explicit some of the tensions of interpretation and
       contradiction that play in the reader-viewer’s response to Young’s
       ‘parson’d’ pages and Blake’s visionary pictures. Practically
       speaking, the question will generally be how and in what ways the designs, singly and
       cumulatively, manage simultaneously (or with lapses) to be faithful to the text of Young and
       true to the poetic and prophetic genius of Blake" (p. 39). This question has a venerable
       tradition in the history of Blake scholarship; it was much the same sort of question
        which—<hi rend="i">grosso modo</hi>—was central in Wicksteed’s studies
       of the <hi rend="i">Job</hi> illustrations, in Roe’s interpretations of Blake’s
       Dante, and in many of the more recent studies of Blake’s response to Milton.
       Ultimately, it might be traced back to Blake himself, notably to his <hi rend="i">Milton: A
        Poem</hi> (where, however, it resulted in poetry, not criticism). The task which Professors
       Rose, Tolley, and Grant have set themselves, will certainly require a method to proceed with
       the utmost caution against over-interpretation, and it is to be hoped that they will remain
       aware of their own warning against the dangers of mere "theorizing about . . . intended
       symbolism[s]" (p. 17). The present writer, however, already feels at a loss if he is
       supposed to judge the critical value of euphoria—as in the following statements about
       the resurrection scene in <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 264: "Instead of fixing the reader with
       the direct eye of Truth [a reference to <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 156 (43E)], his [i.e.
       Christ’s] upcast eyes direct the viewer to the above which is within, the home of
       intelligible meaning. The overcast is opened, not by effort, but by an explosion that is a
       celebration. The outstretched hands that need no longer push the clouds apart [as in <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 1 (31E)], by the piercing light that replaces darkness in all directions;
       opened and made one. The hands simultaneously display to doubters the proof that Jesus <hi rend="i">is</hi> the human family; as he suffered for all, he can offer the infinite expanse
       to all, and even prepare to offer the handclasp of Friendship. Blake never quite depicts this
       moment of fraternity . . . " (pp. 38-39). Such free flow of pseudo-Blakean associations
       (or should I say "illuminations"?)—which, if only translated into less
       ecstatic phrasing, are truisms as relevant for a painting of the resurrection by, for
       example, Sebastiano Ricci as for Blake’s <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 264—must be
       controlled by a more modest inspection of those levels of pictorial meaning which are closer
       to the graphic surface of the illustrations and closer to the eye of their beholder.<ref target="n62" type="note">22</ref><note id="n62"><hi rend="s">22</hi> One such modest consideration—which in fact I
        expect from Tolley’s future comments on the watercolor—would have been a
        reference to the typological connection between the self-sacrifice of Samson in the Old and
        of Christ in the New Testament while discussing the final design (<hi rend="i">NT</hi> 537)
        in the context of the Christologic frontispieces (<hi rend="i">NT</hi> 1 and <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 264). This would seem more relevant to an understanding of Blake’s meaning
        than the aperçu phrase about Samson’s broken pillars which "can now
        represent the conventional fame on which Blake [involuntarily!] turned his back" (p.
        39).</note></p>
            <p>In general, it seems problematic to me, for instance, to "explain" a design in
        <hi rend="i">NT</hi> by reference to some similarity in the artist’s much later
       illuminations in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> Blake was certainly conviced that the full
       meaning of one of his pictures was to be discovered without reference to his other
       productions (outside a given series), much less to those which had not yet been executed. His
       claim to unity in a (single) work of art ought to be taken seriously when attempting an
       interpretation, and it does assign to all comparisons a rather limited significance.
       Blake’s pictorial language is based—and this is especially true of the <hi rend="i">NT</hi> designs<ref target="n63" type="note">23</ref>—on a restricted
       "alphabet" of human postures. These, however, allow for an almost unlimited number
       of combinations. While we can see that one and the same gesture is used throughout
       Blake’s <hi rend="i">oeuvre</hi>, and often with the most contradictory implications,
       it is the combinations which count for an adequate understanding because only they determine
       the meaning of the otherwise isolated letters of this alphabet. A comparison, then, which
       takes into account just one element of a picture, for example the gesture of the outspread
       arms, remains arbitrary and inconclusive—it leads nowhere.<ref target="n64" type="note">24</ref><note id="n63"><hi rend="s">23</hi> See the introductory quotation from Gilchrist’s
         <hi rend="i">Life</hi>, which, I think, is not without some justification.</note><note id="n64"><hi rend="s">24</hi> For an example, see pp. 90, n. 58 and 47 (fig. 8) where
         <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 264 is compared with the last plate in <hi rend="i">All Religions are
         One</hi>, probably just because the latter design is considered as an early appearance of
        the motif of the outspread arms in Blake’s <hi rend="i">oeuvre.</hi></note></p>
            <p>Pages 39-51 describe and reproduce eleven "drawings" which "at least bear a
       closer resemblance to particular <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> designs than they do to
       other finished Blake pictures" (p. 39). The watercolor copy of <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 11,
       painted on a printed leaf of vellum (Henry E. Huntington Library; fig. 1, p. 41), is now no
       longer ascribed to Blake, and much doubt is cast on the authenticity of the drawing of
       "Timon" which is related to <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 115 (Yale University Library; fig.
       5, pp. 43-45).<ref target="n65" type="note">25</ref> The faint iconographic connection
       between the emblem drawing on page 42 of the <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> and <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 26 is described as the relation between a "basic design" and its
       "considerable amplification" (p. 41; fig. 2). With this drawing included, it is
       surprising that no mention is made, for example, of the resemblance between the design for
        <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 61 and the emblem drawing on page 17 of the <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi>,
       both representing the encounter of a youthful traveler with Death, who is waiting for
       him—once as a shrouded skeleton, and then as the usual white-bearded figure in <hi rend="i">NT</hi>—in a doorway. Figure 3 reproduces the fifth plate from "Series
       a" of <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion.</hi> Though one may be surprised to
       find a relief etching among what is said to be a group of "Drawings,"<ref target="n66" type="note">26</ref> no one will fail to recognize its connection with <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 27 (7E). But readers will probably wonder why, for example, the similar
       connection between the second plate of "The Little Black Boy" and <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 378 is omitted from this list. Next comes a labored interpretation of the supposed
       symbolic content of the amalgamation of the two superimposed pencil drawings on the sheet
       which is reproduced as figure 4 (Victoria and Albert Museum). This shows the back-view of a
       figure with arms raised at acute angles which has been drawn over a faint, yet more elaborate
       drawing of a seated female looking to the right. The latter bears some resemblance to
       "Night" in <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 103, and the figure seen from behind is connected
       by the editors with Christ as he appears in <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 127. The distinct stylistic
       differences between the first and rather finished drawing—which appears to be a <hi rend="i">pentimento</hi> that Blake did not care to erase before using the same sheet of
       paper for the second time—and the rough sketch which he drew over it at an apparently
       much faster speed are passed over without mentioning. It is of course difficult to calculate
       the lapse of time between the first and the re-use of the paper; it should have been noted,
       however, that stylistically the superimposed figure is much closer to the design on the verso
       of the sheet ("An Angel Taking a Huge Stride among the Stars") than to the
       underlying drawing of "Night."<ref target="n67" type="note">27</ref> This might
       have warned against an interpretation which to me appears to be a misconstruction of
       Blake’s workshop practice. If the authors say that this combination of the two
       "states" of the drawing suggests "that <pb id="p16-135" n="135"/> the first
       picture was meant to be blocked out" (p. 42) by the second, if they elaborate on this
       fascinating, but rather too brainy idea by asserting that "Christ in the second drawing
       would be intervening to stop Night from telling all she has learned" (p. 43), they are
       guilty of exactly that sort of "theorizing about [the] intended symbolism" (p. 17)
       which they had promised to refrain from.<ref target="n68" type="note">28</ref><note id="n65"><hi rend="s">25</hi> Martin Butlin, too, "finds it very difficult to see

        in the development of one or possibly various <hi rend="i">concetti</hi> all at a time. The
        authors allot symbolic weight to what appears to me an accidental concurrence of sketches,
        and it becomes clear at this point how much Blake studies would profit from a consideration
        of such stimulating new approaches toward descriptive and terminological precision and a
        critical understanding of the act of drawing as Alexander Perrig’s <hi rend="i">Michelangelo Studien I: Michelangelo und die Zeichnungswissenschaft—Ein

        ["Kunstwissenschaftliche Studien," vol. 1]).</note></p>
            <p>The discussion of the "Timon" drawing at Yale (fig. 5) is interesting mostly for
       the "rule" it serves to establish; "as a rule Blake’s successive
       versions of a subject are superior, in invention at least, to their predecessors" (p.
        45).<ref target="n69" type="note">29</ref> But what about the exceptions to the rule? To
       give just one example, one may say that Blake’s "Nebuchadnezzar" in <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> is—if isolated from its context in the
       illuminated book—inferior to its successor, the large color print of c. 1795; so far
       the editors’ rule is easily verified. And yet, if one looks at <hi rend="i">NT</hi>
       299, the third version of the same subject, I cannot accept the idea that "in invention
       at least" this has to be considered the superior treatment. Again, when comparing <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 117 (32E) with the so-called "Nimrod" drawing (Nelson
       Gallery/Atkins Museum of Fine Arts; fig. 6), the editors’ criteria for artistic
       quality prove to be disputable. There certainly ought to be some definition of
       "progression" (p. 46) in art, and a design ought first to be properly described
       before one assigns to it a higher or a lower rank.<ref target="n70" type="note">30</ref>
       Otherwise we will end up with possibly inspired but nonetheless apodictical statements which
       are useless for the "critical scholarship" that this publication is supposed to
       facilitate. The authors’ zeal for their "rule" must underlie their
       comparison of <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 196 to a related drawing from the Cleveland Museum of Art
       (fig. 7). The arguments which are supplied for judging the water color the
       "superior" design border on the ridiculous. How can the lack of detail and
       precision in <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 196 be seriously understood as a gain over the pencil
       drawing "in visual and symbolic statement" (p. 47)? Professors Rose, Grant, Tolley
       observe for themselves that <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 196 is a mirror-image of the drawing, and
       though they offer no explanation for this reversal they rema in in the affirmative about its
       being "most evidently a preliminary drawing" (p. 47). Their statement about the
       artist’s "broadening [of] the symbolic application" in the watercolor by
       means of what is called "small revisions" (p. 47) seems a mystification of
       Blake’s art and of his methods of designing, quite contrary to what he had to say
       about them himself. The Cleveland drawing is definitely superior to <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 196
       in delineation and modeling, and it is certainly the more convincing, though less <hi rend="i">outré</hi>, variant of the subject. But regardless whether one accepts this
       view of the drawing’s superiority over <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 196, or prefers to think
       of it as the preliminary and, "in consequence," the inferior design, this cannot
       supply a decisive clue for the exact dating of the drawing as the authors believe. <note id="n69"><hi rend="s">29</hi> In passing it ought to be mentioned that Blake claimed the
        unity of vision and execution for his works; this unity is not respected by the authors who
        are, it seems, ready to isolate what they call "invention" from the execution of a
        design.</note><note id="n70"><hi rend="s">30</hi> The "mighty hunter" in Blake’s "Let
        Loose the Dogs of War" is said to be "looking back . . . to cheer on his
        untethered single reserve dog" (p. 45). Indeed, the figure is looking back, but
        definitely not downwards at the second dog which appears in the lower right corner of the
        design—the cheering is clearly directed at someone whom we cannot see because he is
        not represented in the drawing as we now have it. Following the direction of the crowned
        hunter’s line of sight one will find, however, that the drawing appears to have been
        trimmed before mounting at least at the right margin where today the edge of the paper is
        cutting through Nimrod’s left foot and through the second of the bloodhounds. By
        means of the false description of the direction of the hunter’s cheering the actual
        incompleteness of the design is in effect converted into a self-sufficient image. The
        consequences of a possible later trimming and the necessity for a reconstruction of the
        original composition thus pass unnoticed because of the rash and prejudiced manner in which
        the editors discharged their duty of examining closely what is actually to be seen on the
        material surface of the drawing.</note></p>
            <p>The chapter ends with a consideration of some early sketches—including the four
       versions of "The Warring Angels"—which were employed for the composition of
        <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 372, 452, and 510 (see figs. 9-11). Though some speculations about
       "Blake’s conjectural repertoire portfolio" (p. 50, see also pp. 48 and 51)
       are brought forward with ever-growing confidence in its former existence, the overall result
       of this search for "Preliminary and Related Drawings" is a negative one. Even if
       all the designs that are represented in this listing are accepted as preparatory for designs
       among the <hi rend="i">NT</hi> watercolors, their quantitative disproportion would still
       confirm what the editors let us know beforehand: "Almost no evidence survives of
       preliminary sketches or drawings; yet he [i.e. Blake] may well have made and discarded
       many" (p. 10). Of course we cannot know how many of Blake’s preparatory sketches
       have been lost; however, the numerous erasures and corrections in the underdrawing of the
       water colors and, in fact, the very weakness of the drawing itself which is to be seen rather
       often even in the finished designs (see, e.g., the legs of the spinning-wheel table in <hi rend="i">NT</hi> 294) seem to indicate that he did not invest the same amount of work in the
       conception and execution of this enormous and—due to the fixed format and the
       repetition of much subject matter in the poem itself—necessarily tiresome series as he
       did in his best work.<ref target="n71" type="note">31</ref><note id="n71"><hi rend="s">31</hi> The chapter on the preliminary designs is followed by a
        discussion of two "Derivative or Possibly Derivative Designs" which had been
        mentioned in Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life.</hi> Both are justly dismissed as bearing
        no, or only a "dubious," relationship with the <hi rend="i">NT</hi> series (see
        pp. 51-52).</note></p>
            <p>The remaining pages of the introduction are entirely concerned with the intricacies of the
       colored version of the engravings and include a new census of twenty-two of the known
        examples.<ref target="n72" type="note">32</ref> Based on a first-hand examination of all
       these colored copies, this account supersedes the earlier compilations of Moss and
        Bentley.<ref target="n73" type="note">33</ref> Whereas in c. 1942 Moss still devoted much
       speculation to the identity of the colorists (preferably Blake or his wife), Grant, Rose, and
       Tolley set this straight by pointing out that any statement "as to when or by whom a
       particular copy was coloured must be regarded as inferential rather than factual" (p.
       53), though they do not exclude the possibility that Blake colored one or more model
        copies.<ref target="n74" type="note">34</ref> The authors describe and distinguish three
       basic schemes or "types" of coloring (see p. 53), with fifteen copies belonging to
       the first, six to the second, and just one copy to the third type (which—until further
       copies with similar coloring happen to turn up—cannot be considered as a proper
       "type," but rather has to be regarded as a unique exception<ref target="n75" type="note">35</ref>). The most important distinction between the three groups is that the
       figure of Death in plate 1E wears a white robe in copies of type I, a green robe in copies of
       type II, and a gray robe in the type-III copy. A further subdivision of the second group is
       based not on a particular difference in coloring, but on the observation that, for two of the
       copies, an earlier state of plate 11E, and, for the four remaining copies in this group as
       well as all the other colored copies, a later state has been used. There is, in any case,
       "a caution against assuming that the family characteristics [of the three types] are
       self evident" (p. 54). A list of thirteen "Major Variations" follows (pp.
       54-55), and three of these—the two states of plate 11, the J C ligature which the
       editors have discovered in several of the colored copies, and the so-called
       "grotesque" coloring of some of the designs in the first group—are discussed
       at length on the succeeding pages. All the empirical information presented in this section is
       new, yet so far these observations rather serve to introduce "further complication"
       (p. 57) than to clarify the matter. This, of course, is <pb id="p16-136" n="136"/> not to be
       blamed on the editors, who deserve our admiration for their close scrutiny of the copies.
        <note id="n72"><hi rend="s">32</hi> On p. 53 twenty-three copies are said to be known while
        the census lists only twenty-two of them. This discrepancy is due to the then untraced
        Gaisford copy (Moss-Bentley, Copy G); see also note 38, below.</note><note id="n73"><hi rend="s">33</hi> See W. E. Moss, ‘‘The Coloured Copies of

        the surest evidence of Blake’s own responsibility for the tinting of a particular
        copy," (p. 55) Professors Grant, Rose, and Tolley would vote for their Copies I-1,
        I-15, and IIB-1 as the most likely candidates (see pp. 54, 60-61, and the color specimen in
        vol. 2). In the case of Copy IIB-1 (Moss-Bentley, Copy B) this means that they agree with
        Moss’s connoisseur belief which is said to have been based on "faith [rather]
        than evidence" (p. 61), and, in a different context, is quoted as providing "a
        clear example of the limitations of impressionistic scholarship" (p. 4)! Yet another
        paragraph does at least allow for "the possibility that Blake himself had no
        responsibility for any of these [coloring] schemes" (p. 60).</note><note id="n75"><hi rend="s">35</hi> "Type III, is quite likely to have been done by some
        possessor of an uncolored copy for his own enjoyment, or as a forgery" (p. 60; see also
        p. 62).</note></p>
            <p>The "Need for a New Census" of the colored copies, its coding system, and the
       reasons for the particular sequence of copies which is chosen here are explained on pages
       60-62. The identification of each copy by the combination of roman and arabic numerals is
       meant as a source of information in itself.<ref target="n76" type="note">36</ref> The three
       "types" of coloring are referred to by the roman numerals I-III, and while the
       capital letters A and B mark the subdivision of type II, the arabic numerals attempt to group
       various copies according to some other characteristics they have in common.<ref target="n77" type="note">37</ref> This system has certain advantages over the alphabetization of copies
       which is so well known from the bibliographies of Sir Geoffrey Keynes and G. E. Bentley, Jr.
       A designation like "IIB-3" will translate to the initiated as "Green Death
       type of coloring: plate 11 in final state: Explanation sheet following front matter,"
       whereas "Copy H" carries none of these data. I am afraid, however, that when more
       copies come to light and need to be fitted in, this advantage of the new coding system will
       soon be lost. For example, there simply is no room for another copy of the White Death type,
       with the explanations following page [96] in the copy’s proper place, that is between
       Copy I-7 (which is the last of the White Death group with the explanations bound at the end
       of the book) and Copy I-8 (which is the first copy of the same group that has the
       explanations following the advertisement). The introduction of capital letters following the
       arabic numerals will be necessary in this case, and beside the growing complicatedness of the
       copy designation there is a limit to even that sort of rationalization (imagine a sequence
       like I-6, I-6A, I-6B, I-6AA, etc.). So in ten years’ time all this fuss about a new
       system of copy identifications will probably appear as much ado about nothing. <note id="n76"><hi rend="s">36</hi> This coding system is reminiscent of Nancy Bogen’s census in
        her edition of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> (in which Professor Erdman also took a hand). Whereas
        for Bogen the roman numerals served to designate various stages of textual revision, they
        are here employed to differentiate between the three coloring schemes. See William Blake,
         <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi>, A Facsimile and a Critical Text, ed. Nancy W. Bogen
        (Providence, R. I. and New York: Brown University Press and NYPL, 1971), pp. 53-55.</note><note id="n77"><hi rend="s">37</hi> Thus, copies with the Explanation sheet bound between the
        Advertisement and 1E follow those where it is bound at the end of the book; the
        "earliness of provenance that could be established" (p. 61) serves as another
        criterion for the grouping.</note></p>
            <p>While the two untraced copies from Bentley’s list (Copies G and T) are excluded from
       the new census—which is keyed to color schemes and does not allow for the insertion of
       copies which are not available for inspection—four previously unknown colored copies
       of the edition of 1797 have here been fully documented for the first time (Copies I-7, I-10,
       I-15, III-1).<ref target="n78" type="note">38</ref> To establish the provenances of some of
       the copies must have been extremely difficult. This is illustrated by the fact that no less
       than three copies (I-7, I-12, I-14) are said to have belonged, at one time or the other, to
       just one collector, A. Edward Newton.<ref target="n79" type="note">39</ref> Though—in
       the authors’ own words—"there are likely to be errors" (p. 62) in the
       lists of ownerships which they provide, they have dealt admirably with this task. Also, the
       minute descriptions of the bindings, page sizes, and collations which are supplied for each
       copy leave nothing to be desired. Like the table of engraved designs, this census is another
       piece of competent work. <note id="n78"><hi rend="s">38</hi> Most probably, however, one will
        have to identify Bentley’s untraced Copy T with Copy I-7 of the new census. The
        latter was "<hi rend="i">perhaps</hi> acquired by A. Edward Newton" (p. 65) before
        it passed through the hands of Mrs. George E. Edmunds to the Detroit Institute of Arts in
        January 1927, and Copy T is "untraced" since it was sold from the library of A.
        Edward Newton in May 1926. Bentley quotes the sale catalogue as stating that in this copy
        the "text has been ruled throughout" (Anderson Galleries, 29 May 1926, lot 25; see
        Bentley, suppl. 1977-78, p. 150). This is in keeping with the "most distinctive
        feature" of the Detroit copy, viz. "that the text on all the pages has been
        framed, not very neatly, in single or double lines of unpleasing violet ink . . . . Titles
        are single, double or triple overlined and underlined" (p. 65). For references to the
        Moss-Bentley Copy G see pp. 53, 61, and 92, n. 81, in the present edition; this copy has now
        been located in the collection of the Lutheran Church in America by Thomas V. Lange, and has
        been placed as copy I-12A in the 1980 census (see "A Rediscovered Colored Copy of
        Young’s ‘Night Thoughts,’" <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, 15
        [1981-1982], 134-36).</note><note id="n79"><hi rend="s">39</hi> Today, there are three copies, one of each type of
        coloring, at Harvard, and with two copies each the Paul Mellon collection, the Rosenwald
        collection, and the Pierpont Morgan Libary also provide the opportunity to study different
        copies side by side (see p. 62).</note></p>
            <p>At the end of the introductory essay readers will find a "Checklist of Studies and
       Reproductions" with short commentaries for many of the ninety-six entries (pp. 72-84). A
       classed bibliography like this, arranged chronologically, is useful primarily because it
       reflects something of the history of the reception of the <hi rend="i">NT</hi> illustrations
       in Blake criticism. This checklist, like all such lists, does not really include
       "every" relevant "published study" as the compilers claim (see p. 72).
       But just the same the list certainly does facilitate research on Blake’s <hi rend="i">NT</hi>, as I have found myself when preparing this review.</p>
            <p>At this point, and before an attempt is made to sum up the results, a word on book
       production may be in order. A large format type face which is as legible as it is well
       designed has been employed for the printing of the text, and the lavish layout of the
       introduction leaves those beautiful wide margins to which we are no longer accustomed. The
       disastrous effect of the creamy paper for pictorial printing has been noted above, but the
       same paper is excellent for the text. Misprints are few, and only the binding of these
       volumes might not have been designed for such heavy stuff.<ref target="n80" type="note">40</ref> Clarendon Press has possibly been the most active and important publisher for
       Blake books in recent years, and it hardly needs to be mentioned that they have produced
       books which show both "the full elaboration of colour-printing" and the
       "accuracy [of] fine-screen offset lithography" in plain black and white.<ref target="n81" type="note">41</ref> All the same it is to be regreted that the results
       achieved in the quality of reproduction for the first complete edition of William
       Blake’s <hi rend="i">NT</hi> will not figure as a page of glory in the annals of this
       distinguished firm. <note id="n80"><hi rend="s">40</hi> After only a few days of (careful)

            <p>The introductory essay, as a whole, does not really introduce the reader to the 537
       watercolors which—thus at least I suspected—are its designated object. Instead,
       the essay rather serves to trace the development of the forty-three engravings for
       Young’s <hi rend="i">NT.</hi> Though the basic information on the outward
       circumstances of the production of the water color designs, on their subsequent history, and
       on their preservation is all there, a curious disproportion caused most of the text to be
       occupied with bibliographic material relating to the engraved version of the designs.<ref target="n82" type="note">42</ref> Though no doubt much is added here to our knowledge, it is
       a bit of a disappointment if, after all these years of study on the editors’ side, and
       after all these years of waiting on the side of their Blakean audience, we are still left
       with the more important questions concerning the iconology, style, and aesthetic achievment
       of this series of illustrations. By the time the commentary appears in print, all this may
       eventually be forgotten, and yet I maintain that much of what has now been published unter
       the misleading title of an introduction would have made a splendid appendix. It offers
       answers to the sort of chalcographic questions which the student of the water color designs
       and the general reader are likely to ask not in the first but in the last place. <note id="n82"><hi rend="s">42</hi> Whereas there are only about twenty-one pages concerning the
        water colors and the supposedly preparatory drawings, some forty-five pages deal exclusively
        with the printed version and its colored copies.</note></p>
            <p>That this edition will nevertheless become a tool of major importance for the study of
       Blake’s art and its symbolic meaning is beyond doubt, and I hope that the very
       copiousness of my notes on both text and plates of the <hi rend="i">Complete Edition</hi>
       will convey <pb id="p16-137" n="137"/> something of this importance. At the same time I
       firmly believe that an irretrievable chance has been wasted as regards the overall quality,
       the potential usefulness, and the reliability of this tool. The editors deserve our gratitude
       for finally making available to a larger public these riches which were formerly hidden away
       in the unwieldy boxes at the British Museum Print Room. Yet gratitude is mingled with
       resentment for the editors’ and publisher’s sheer carelessness. As has been
       demonstrated above, it is hard to believe that any serious and responsible attempt has been
       made to properly check the proofs of the reproductions against the originals while seeing
       these volumes through the press.<ref target="n83" type="note">43</ref> Even today their
       production has been very costly; it is self-evident that in all likelihood a publication
       project of this scope for the <hi rend="i">NT</hi> series will not likely be possible again
       for at least half a century. During this time Blake scholars will have to work with this
       edition or none at all, and I cannot do otherwise than blame those who did not see to it that
       libraries and prospective private buyers get the very best that is to be achieved with modern
       printing techniques. More than 180 years after the initial publication of Edward’s
       selection from the complete series, Blake’s illustrations for Edward Young’s
        <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> remain ill-fated, and this to an extent they certainly do
       not deserve.<ref target="n84" type="note">44</ref><note id="n83"><hi rend="s">43</hi> It is not that I expected a Trianon Press facsimile of so
        large a number of designs, not even at $365. How much closer one can get to the original
        colors with the ordinary offset processes and at a moderate price is to be seen in various
        cheap volumes with reproductions from Blake’s work such as the Dover <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>, the OUP <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> and <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi>, and
        especially the sixteen color plates in the 1972 Gray exhibition handbook. See William Blake,

        discussion with the following "intellectual spears": "Dialogue is difficult,
        even with disputants who are thoroughly conversant with the issues and evidence, if their
        overriding concern is to vindicate themselves rather than to correct error whatever its
        origin. Strenuous encounter magnifies the danger, but mildness is no more reliable guarantee
        against indulgence in selfhood. Correspondents of the <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi>
        must believe that a number of essential truths in Blake’s art can be identified and
        that assertions about them can be evaluated. When the question at issue has a markedly
        empirical dimension a scholar must be prepared to lay out all his evidence for inspection.
        Most Blakeists would agree with these principles, at least in theory." (John E. Grant,
        "Mother of Invention, Father in Drag, or Observations on the Methodology that Brought
        About these Deplorable Conditions and What Then is to be Done," <hi rend="i">Blake
         Newsletter</hi>, 2 [1968], 29). My review of the <hi rend="i">Complete Edition</hi> of
        Blake’s <hi rend="i">NT</hi> illustrations is controversial, but I have tried to
        adhere to Grant’s principles and to lay out the evidence as far as even a long review
        article allows for that. And I surely hope that readers will find I have done so not merely
        in theory, but in practice.</note></p>

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>At lunch time on 6, 7, 13, and 14 July 1982 the City of London Festival included
      performances of a ballet, <hi rend="i">Songs &amp; Proverbs of William Blake</hi>,
      choreographed by Erica Knighton to the song cycle of the same name by Benjamin Britten. The
      selection of words for the cycle was made by Peter Pears. About twenty-two minutes in
      performance, the ballet was performed by two dancers—Anna McCartney, from the Scottish
      Ballet, and Christopher Blagdon, from the British Ballet—in simple costumes based on
      Blake’s drawings. The choreography is said to have been based in large part on
      Blake’s drawings as well. The music was performed live at each of the performances by
      Stewart Buchanan (baritone) and Paul Webster (piano). Further information might be obtained
      from Erica Knighton, the choreographer (32, Fellows Rd., London N.W. 3).</p>

          <p>Morris Eaves and Michael Fischer are team-teaching a year-long course on "The Romantic
      Self" at the University of New Mexico during 1982-83. The course is about the
      relationships between romanticism and contemporary critical theory. The first semester, which
      focuses on the historical contest between neoclassical and romantic theories of art, lays the
      groundwork for the second semester, which focuses on recent movements in critical theory.
      Throughout the year, visitors will come to campus to discuss their own work with the class.
      The visitors include, among others, W.J.T. Mitchell (Univ. of Chicago) in October, Stanley
      Cavell (Harvard) in November, Northrop Frye (Univ. of Toronto) in February, J. Hillis Miller
      (Yale) and M.H. Abrams (Cornell) in March. Each visitor will attend two class sessions and
      deliver a public lecture.</p>
