        <p>One of the special pleasures of studying William Blake’s prints is the
                    way new treasures keep turning up.<ref target="n0" type="note">*</ref><note id="n0">EDITORS’ NOTE: COPY h OF THE
                        SONGS OF INNOCENCE AND OF EXPERIENCE HAS RECENTLY RE-EMERGED. FOR MORE
                        INFORMATION SEE THE NEWS SECTION OF THIS ISSUE.</note> The following is a brief report on several of
                    his illuminated books and single leaves therefrom that have come to light in
                    recent months, supplemented by a discussion of some previously recorded
                    impressions with unusual characteristics deserving more attention than they have
                    received in the past.</p>
        <p>On 13 January 1830, Sotheby’s in London offered at auction a small
                    volume listed in the catalogue as lot 41 and described as
                    "Blake’s Phantasies, Songs of Innocence and of Experience,
                    on 55 PLATES, <hi rend="i">brown calf, elegant, very rare.</hi>"
                    According to an annotated copy of the catalogue in the British Museum Print
                    Room, the vendor was Robert Balmanno (1780-1865), the great Stothard collector
                    who apparently also owned copy U of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> and
                    other works by Blake. Lot 41 was sold to "Glynn" for the
                    munificent sum of one pound. Nothing further was known of this volume to either
                    Keynes and Wolf in 1953 or Bentley in 1977, in whose bibliographies it is listed
                    as untraced copy BB of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of
                        Experience.</hi><ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> After an absence of 150
                    years, the book reappeared to public view in the spring of 1980 and was offered
                    at auction once again at Sotheby’s, this time in their
                    Hodgson’s Rooms on Chancery Lane, on 1 May 1980, as lot 100.
                    According to a pencil note on the title-page, the volume was "Bought of
                    Blake May 1816," probably by Balmanno or someone acting for him. The
                    auction catalogue further indicates that, after Glynn’s purchase in
                    1830, the book passed to John Wild, whose initials are written "over
                    the small partly erased library stamp in the lower margin of the general title,
                    and who inserted his bookplate." Wild’s library passed to
                    his cousin and the book remained in the cousin’s family until its
                    sale from "The Property of a Lady" on 1 May. The volume
                    fetched £16,000 from Andrew Edmunds, the London printdealer, who sold it
                    shortly after the auction to the Oxfordshire bookdealer Colin Franklin. He sold
                    it by August 1980 to the New York bookdealer Justin G. Schiller, in whose
                    private collection the volume now resides. <note id="n1"><hi rend="s">1</hi>

                    importance deserves preliminary notice in this journal. The information
                    presented here is based on the auction catalogue and descriptions of the book
                    supplied by Donald Heald, who inspected the book for me prior to the auction,
                    and Andrew Edmunds. There can be no doubt that the volume now owned by Mr.
                    Schiller is copy BB. It is bound in early nineteenth-century brown calf, the
                    spine elaborately decorated in gilt tooling and stamped
                    "Blake’s Phantasies." These features explain the
                    description of the binding and odd title given the book in the 1830 auction
                    catalogue. At the inner margin of the general title-page are fragments of blue
                    paper—probably remnants of the original wrapper in which Blake or
                    Mrs. Blake bound the book. The 55 plates (the usual 54 plus pl. b, "A
                    Divine Image") on 55 leaves are printed in black ink with the delicacy
                    and maculated textures typical of Blake’s inking. The leaves (wove
                    paper, apparently without watermark) measure about 18.3 × 11.8 cm.
                    Many plates contain thinly inked areas that have been carefully painted over in
                    black, perhaps diluted India ink. This hand work suggests that the <pb id="p15-5" n="5"/> book was not simply left uncolored but was specifically
                    prepared for sale as a copy in black. Three plates, however, have some hand
                    coloring (see illus. 1). Unlike the black tinting in thinly printed relief
                    areas, the light washes in etched whites on these plates are not applied with
                    much skill and may have been added by someone other than Blake. The plates are
                    numbered consecutively in gray ink just above the upper right corner. The form
                    of these numbers is very similar to those in copy T of <hi rend="i">Songs of
                        Innocence and of Experience</hi>; they were in all probability written by
                    Blake. <note id="n2"><hi rend="s">2</hi> Mr. Schiller tells me, in a letter of 7
                        July 1980, that exclusive rights to inspect and describe the volume have
                        been granted to one individual (not me) until August 1982. There is,
                        however, a brief report, without reproductions from copy BB, by Sir Geoffrey
                        Keynes in <hi rend="i">The Book Collector</hi>, 30 (Spring 1980), 39-42. Sir
                        Geoffrey records the following sequence for the plates: 1-4, 6-7, 11, 25,
                        18, 19, 15, 16-17, 22-23, 20-21, 9-10, 12, 8, 27, 24, 5, 13, 14, 26, 54,
                        28-33, b, 38, 46, 51, 45, 47, 41, 39, 52, 43, 53, 37, 50, 42, 44, 49, 34-36,
                        40, 48. The plate offsets correspond to this sequence.</note></p>
        <p>Blake generally issued complete copies of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> in 54
                    plates. Only three early copies (B-D) contain the tailpiece (pl. a) without
                    text, and these lack "To Tirzah." Before the rediscovery of
                    copy BB, "A Divine Image" (pl. b) was known only through the
                    posthumous impressions in copies a, c, and n of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> and
                    a loose impression in Sir Geoffrey Keynes’ collection.<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> The impression of "A Divine
                    Image" (illus. 2) in copy BB is thus of considerable importance. It is
                    the only impression undoubtedly printed by Blake and included by him in a copy
                    of the <hi rend="i">Songs.</hi> It is also significant that the poem is included
                    as plate 35 in the volume, and thus is an integral part of the book rather than
                    a supplementary plate at the end. The presence of "A Divine

                    rejected tailpiece but including complete texts of all the poems of the
                    anthology. It certainly deserves more thorough bibliographic and chalcographic
                    study than the cursory description given here. <note id="n3"><hi rend="s">3</hi>
                        The Keynes impression, reproduced as pl. 3 in the Keynes and Wolf <hi rend="i">Census</hi>, is in gray with the upper border surrounding the
                        text wiped free of ink (except for residual smudges). Such cleaning of the
                        borders is typical of Blake’s pre-1800 impressions of relief
                        etchings, but is also found in a few posthumous impressions. This impression
                        is poorly printed, but it may be an early working proof pulled by
                        Blake.</note></p>

                    The front endpapers are marbled, followed by a blank fly-leaf showing a foolscap
                    watermark. The same binding papers are repeated at the end, except that the
                    blank fly-leaf is without watermark. The plates are numbered consecutively in
                    pencil, top right. As in other posthumous copies, most of the plates are heavily
                    inked and printed, although the borders of some are very lightly inked. The
                    white-line work on the title-page to <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> is badly
                    clogged with ink; the frontispiece to <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> and
                    "The Lamb" contain some foul inking of etched whites. The
                    first plate of "The Ecchoing Green" is very heavily inked, the
                    second rather lightly inked. That this is a posthumous copy is confirmed by the
                    fact that it is printed on J WHATMAN 1831 and 1832 paper, as indicated by the

        <p>This volume was acquired at an unknown time, probably in the 1920s, by Mrs.
                    George Madison (Alice) Millard of Pasadena, California. A note by her describing
                    the book is still preserved with it. Mrs. Millard, the proprietor of the Little

                        Innocence</hi>, sold the book for $100 to Mrs. John Hudson Poole (nee

                    husband, in whose house the book remained until his death in 1955 when his book
                    collection was packed and stored by his heirs. They placed the Blake

                    acquired the depleted collection by 1906. Written in ink below the image is
                        "<hi rend="u">Murder</hi>. (the Assassin awaiting his

                    to E. Weyhe Inc.) and is listed as untraced in Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake
                        Books</hi>, p. 341. The print was acquired by Mr. and Mrs. Philip Hofer,
                    probably directly from Weyhe, and given by Mrs. Frances Hofer in 1979 to the
                    Houghton Library, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts (illus. 5). The
                    unwatermarked wove sheet, 31.3 × 22.6 cm., bears stab holes along the
                    left margin, "36" in ink top right (George A.
                    Smith’s original foliation), "24" in pencil top
                    left (Macgeorge foliation?), "PX" in pencil bottom left (a
                    bookdealer’s coded price?), and "Europe page 10."
                    in pencil below the left corner of the image. A pen and ink framing line extends
                    along all four sides of the plate mark; a second frame in the same ink is 4 mm.
                    from the image. The basic printing color is brown, but the text (except for a
                    few words in lines 5 through 9) has been gone over with a pen in black ink. Much
                    of the design is poorly printed and the spider webs, insects, leaves at the
                    bottom, and outlines of the figure lower right have also been worked over in
                    black ink. The dark areas at the bottom are color printed in
                    green—rather patchy on the right, but thick and heavy in the lower
                    left corner. The impression appears to be an experimental pull, perhaps rejected
                    because of the poor inking and color printing. However, Blake (or someone else?)
                    spent a good deal of time with pen &amp; ink trying to salvage the print.
                    If this work was indeed done by Blake, perhaps he intended to hand color the
                    design further and transform it into an impression of sufficient quality to use
                    in a copy of <hi rend="i">Europe.</hi></p>
        <p>Mrs. Hofer has also given the Houghton Library a copy of <hi rend="i">Little Tom
                        the Sailor.</hi> It is printed in dull black ink on a wove sheet 49.9
                    × 17 cm., cut close on the right with the loss of a fraction of the
                    image. The dark areas in the designs may have been hand tinted with India ink.
                    This example, at one time in the Graham Robertson collection, is included as no.

        <p>While there are a good many unbound and now widely scattered proofs of the <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> plates, separate impressions from <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> are extremely rare: Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, p.

                    Harvey. I recently came upon an unrecorded impression of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, pl. 13 (illus. 6), at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which
                    received the print as a gift from Carl Zigrosser in 1975. On the back of the
                    unwatermarked wove sheet, 21.2 × 15.4 cm., Zigrosser has written the
                    following: "Milton Descending etching by William Blake trial proof
                    printed in two colors [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>; see below] #358
                    Binyon’s Engraved Designs of W. Blake [followed by a reference to
                    Blake’s <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and quotation of lines 13, 21-23
                    from pl. 12] This print was purchased by Alexander W Drake, former art editor of
                    The Century, from Gilchrists [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] in the 1890’s.
                    Sessler purchased it from Drake’s widow, living in Stockbridge Mass
                    and I purchased it from Sesslers." This is very probably the print
                    described by W. M. Rossetti, in his list of Blake’s engravings in
                    Alexander Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi>, as a
                    "Figure, with a glory, standing before a rising or setting sun or

                    did not realize that the plate was executed for one of the illuminated books. He
                    does not indicate as much, but the print was probably then (1863) in the
                    collection of Mrs. Gilchrist, from whom it passed to her son, Herbert H.
                    Gilchrist, and then by sale in the 1890s to Alexander W. Drake. <note id="n10"><hi rend="s">10</hi> Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Life of Blake</hi> (London

        <p>There is no reason to question Zigrosser’s provenance for this
                    impression, although Sessler’s purchase and sales records, 1919-1975,
                    contain no record of the print.<ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref> Zigrosser

                    was acquired from "Nicholson," not Drake, and is probably the
                    intaglio impression of the experimental relief and white-line etching, sometimes

        <p>I do not believe that it has been noticed previously that this plate exists in
                    two states. In comparison to the impressions in copies A, B (illus. 7), and C of
                        <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, the Philadelphia example shows fewer relief
                    plateaus between white-line cross-hatchings just below the figure’s
                    left breast, apparently the result of more tool work in this area. The clearest
                    difference, however, and one that can not be explained simply as inking and
                    printing variations, is the boldly scratched white lines below and to the left
                    of the man’s right foot, clearly visible in the Philadelphia
                    impression but not in copies A, B, and C.<ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref>
                    This same second state with additional white-line work also appears in copy D of
                    the illuminated book (illus. 8). Thus, the second state was executed rather late
                    in the production of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, sometime between c. 1808 when
                    copies A-C were printed and 1815 (or later) when copy D was printed.<ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref><note id="n13"><hi rend="s">13</hi> For a reproduction of the plate in copy A,

        <p>The figure and his immediate surroundings are lightly printed in reddish-brown.
                    The dark areas above (see illus. 6) are heavily inked and printed in blue-green;
                    the dark ground below the figure is in black. There is a small spot of olive
                    green—perhaps simply a thin droplet of the blue-green in the
                    sky—on the man’s torso just above his left hip. The
                    thickly printed colors show the dendritic reticulations of Blake’s
                    color printing, c. 1794-1796. I suspect, however, that these are not opaque gum-
                    or glue-based pigments, but thick ink, perhaps partly dried even before its
                    uneven application to the plate. Yet it is surprising to find that Blake
                    continued to experiment, well into the nineteenth century, with opaque coloring
                    techniques and reticulated textures so characteristic of his work of the
                    mid-1790s.</p>
        <p>Professor G. E. Bentley, Jr., was another recent visitor to the Philadelphia

                    treasures to a most assiduous prospector, and he has asked me to record his

                    nineteenth-century relief printing of plates intended for hand coloring. The
                    cadmium orange ink is similar to the ink in copies U (on paper watermarked
                    1815), Z, and AA (both printed c. 1825) of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and
                        of Experience.</hi> The coloring of the text area in the second plate of
                    "The Little Black Boy" and the ink framing lines (blue, rather
                    than the usual red) are typical of late copies of the <hi rend="i">Songs.</hi>
                    The India paper also bespeaks a late date of printing. None of
                    Blake’s original graphics on laid India were unquestionably printed
                    until the 1820s. As I have suggested elsewhere,<ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref> Linnell’s influence may have prompted the use of such
                    paper, for he favored laid India even for unfinished proofs. <note id="n16"><hi rend="s">16</hi> See my <hi rend="i">William Blake, Printmaker</hi>
                        (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1980), p. 220. Linnell’s
                        preference for laid India may perhaps be explained by the need for a paper
                        smooth and hard enough to take an accurate impression of the dense patterns
                        of fine lines and flick work on his engraved portraits.</note></p>
        <p>The inking and printing of the plates clearly point to Blake’s hand,
                    but I am much less certain about the incomplete hand coloring. The washes on all
                    three impressions are thin, even, and applied to fairly broad areas with some
                    disregard for printed outlines. These features can be found in
                    Blake’s hand coloring of the early 1790s, but by the nineteenth
                    century he had developed a far more sophisticated style with greater delicacy
                    and precision in the application of colors. The best examples show fine brush
                    work, similar to the technique of miniature painting, and subtle blending at the
                    borders between colors—yet without any violation of outlines.
                    Christ’s gown on the second plate of "The Little Black
                    Boy" is colored a bright scarlet found in no other impression.<ref target="n17" type="note">17</ref> None of these three plates contains any of
                    the drawing with pen and ink (or sometimes even pencil) so typical of
                    Blake’s work. It may be unfair to compare the coloring of these
                    plates to finished examples in complete copies of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>,
                    but my doubts persist nonetheless. <note id="n17"><hi rend="s">17</hi> At least

        <p>Proof impressions of Blake’s relief etchings with incomplete inking or
                    coloring are rarely as beautiful as finished examples, but they can provide
                    interesting information about his graphic processes. Even recorded impressions
                    of this type in well-catalogued public collections deserve more careful study.
                    Wandering through that enormous repository of information, Bentley’s
                        <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, one can all too easily overlook the special
                    qualities of odd proofs and unfinished pulls. Although New Haven, Connecticut,
                    is more famous for theoretical speculation than chalcographic treasures, the
                    city’s leading university offers several opportunities to study

                    Plate 25 (illus. 11) clearly demonstrates that Blake was able to color print
                    from etched areas (upper right, and the figure lower left) as well as relief
                        plateaus.<ref target="n19" type="note">19</ref> The extreme shallowness of

                    type of proto-planographic printing. The etching of the design provided little
                    more than a guide for the hand painting of the copperplate. <note id="n18"><hi rend="s">18</hi> Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, pp. 168, 341,
                        records these prints as still in Rosenbloom’s collection and does
                        not note their special features. Their bequest to Yale is noted in
                        Bentley’s "Supplement" (see footnote 1). They
                        are designated as copy H by Bentley. The three plates were once part of the
                        large collection of prints bound by George A. Smith with the
                        "Order" of the <hi rend="i">Songs.</hi> They were acquired
                        by Rosenbloom at the George C. Smith auction, Parke Bernet, 2 November 1938,

        <p>The Beinecke Library also owns two impressions of the title-page for <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi> and one of pl. 4 from the same illuminated book.
                    The first two (illus. 12, 13) constitute a rare set of progress proofs. The two
                    illuminated books etched in intaglio, <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi>, do not lend themselves to color printing
                    from the surface of the copperplates. The pressure necessary for good intaglio
                    printing is far too great for color printing from surfaces. The title-page to
                        <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> (copy A, British Museum) shows that the
                    design must have been color printed or blotted with a separate plate or piece of
                    paper rather than the copperplate bearing the etched text.<ref target="n20" type="note">20</ref> The exceptionally light printing of the text in the
                    first Beinecke proof (illus. 12) suggests that Blake may have been trying, at
                    least in this one case, to print simultaneously from the intaglio lines and the
                    surface of the plate in two colors. The results are not promising. The second
                    proof (illus. 13) is much better as an intaglio impression and the four-color
                    printing of the design area is more even with fewer streaks and uncovered spots.
                    It seems unlikely that work of this quality could have been produced in one run
                    through the press. Thus these two proofs may record Blake’s progress
                    from single to double printing for his intaglio, color printed
                    books—a progress that led to a technical division between printing
                    texts and printing designs with important consequences. In this same period
                    during the mid-1790s, Blake’s color printing began to develop
                    independent of his work as a poet, most successfully in the great 1795 color
                    printed drawings, and finally evolved into the so-called
                    "tempera" paintings of 1799-1800. <note id="n20"><hi rend="s">20</hi> See Essick, <hi rend="i">William Blake, Printmaker</hi>, p. 130

        <p>In "Blake in the Marketplace, 1976-77,"<ref target="n21" type="note">21</ref> I recorded the sale at auction of impressions of the
                    designs without text of "The Shepherd" and
                    "Spring" from <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence.</hi> These two
                    prints (illus. 14, 15) were acquired in 1978 by the Yale Center for British Art,
                    New Haven. They are not incomplete or working proofs, but highly finished color
                    prints of great beauty. They are two of only three known color printed designs
                    from <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>: in copies of <hi rend="i">Songs of
                        Innocence and of Experience</hi> containing color printing, such work is
                    confined to the <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> plates alone. The Yale Center
                    prints are cut close to the designs, and thus it is possible that the plates
                    were originally printed with the texts and cut apart by someone other than
                    Blake. I suspect, however, that both were printed as designs only with the texts
                    masked. If so, then these prints are similar to Blake’s work in the
                    "Large" and "Small" Books of Design.
                    "The Shepherd" and "Spring" now at the Yale
                    Center may have been produced for the conjectural copy B of the Small Book of
                    Designs or <pb id="p15-13" n="13"/> some similar collection of color printed
                        miniatures.<ref target="n22" type="note">22</ref> Like the other prints
                    described here, they testify to Blake’s life-long commitment to
                    innovation in the graphic arts. But far more than the others, these two small
                    prints demonstrate the excellence of his best work. <note id="n21"><hi rend="s">21</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly</hi>, 12 (1978), 31.</note><note id="n22"><hi rend="s">22</hi> See G. E. Bentley, Jr., "Dr. James

        <p>In his later works, William Blake occasionally fails to maintain his usual sharp
                    distinction between the God who brought about the fall into matter and uttered
                    the Ten Commandments and the Divine Humanity who manifests as Jesus and is
                    immanent in each individual. What, for example, are we to make of the couplets
                    on plate 3 of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, which announce that he who spoke on
                    Sinai inspires the epic, or of the Prologue to <hi rend="i">For the Sexes: The
                        Gates of Paradise</hi>, which informs us that Jehovah, having written the
                    Decalogue, repents and inters it under His Mercy Seat?</p>
        <p>Some commentators have recognized the problem which arises from such passages as
                    these. Sloss and Wallis complain that "Throughout the later writings
                    confusion arises from Blake’s use of the terms God, Jehovah, and
                    Jehovah Elohim"; Milton Percival, discussing Blake’s
                    treatment of the Incarnation, regrets that "The divine names are not
                    clearly differentiated from one another"; and Kathleen Raine confesses
                    that Blake does not always employ the name Jehovah consistently. Harold Bloom
                    tackles the problem by distinguishing between a "humanizing"
                    and a "Urizenic" Jehovah but does not specify the relations
                    between them. Probing more deeply, Jean Hagstrum sees Christian love
                    transforming Jehovah the tyrant into Christ-Jehovah the compassionate Father,
                    yet we are left to wonder about Jehovah’s origin and about his
                    pre-Christian forgiveness of Cain in <hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel.</hi> Anne
                    Mellor’s suggestion that Jesus the Imagination absorbs the reasoner
                    Jehovah, reconciling his law and energetic wrath with love and mercy, faces the
                    same objections and makes a puzzle of Jesus’ abundant energy in
                    "The Everlasting Gospel." Bo Lindberg locates the
                    inconsistency in Jehovah Himself, claiming that he favors his sons Satan and
                    Jesus alternately but overlooking the fact that it is Adam, not Jesus, who is
                    Satan’s brother in Blake’s myth. Finally, Thomas
                    Altizer’s argument that Blake’s God and Satan have an
                    underlying identity depends heavily on what he admits is "a single
                    symbolic image," namely the Seven Eyes of God, and, as Ronald Grimes
                    points out, he blurs the distinctions between God, Satan, and Urizen.<ref target="n23" type="note">1</ref><note id="n23"><hi rend="s">1</hi> D. J. Sloss and J. P. R. Wallis, ed., <hi rend="i">The Prophetic Writings of William Blake</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon

        <p>The question at issue should not be confused with two related but distinct
                    problems—the conundrum of who created the cosmos and the puzzle posed
                    by certain statements in Blake’s annotations to Watson’s
                        <hi rend="i">Apology for the Bible.</hi> It has long been recognized<ref target="n24" type="note">2</ref> that from <hi rend="i">The Book of
                        Urizen</hi> (1794) onwards Creation has two aspects in Blake’s
                    system. On the one hand it is "Error" (E555/K617), a
                    degenerate state into which a portion of Eternity falls in a process described
                    in the first chapter of Genesis; on the other hand it is "an act of
                    Mercy" (E553/K614), a limitation imposed on the Fall to make redemption
                    possible. Thus Blake can denounce Creation (the Fall) as the work of the
                        Devil,<ref target="n25" type="note">3</ref> yet praise Creation (the
                    limitation of the Fall) as the achievement of Los, Jehovah, and Jesus.<ref target="n26" type="note">4</ref><note id="n24"><hi rend="s">2</hi> See, for example, P. Berger, <hi rend="i">William Blake: Poet and Mystic</hi>, trans. Daniel H. Conner (London:

        <p>Once, in 1798, Blake goes beyond the defense of nature as a merciful limitation
                    on the Fall. In annotating Bishop Watson’s <hi rend="i">An Apology
                        for the Bible</hi>, a riposte to Thomas Paine’s Deist tract <hi rend="i">The Age of Reason</hi>, Blake states that the Bible tells him that
                    God created nature perfect and that its imperfections <pb id="p15-15" n="15"/>
                    result from Adam’s sin; he also endorses the sixth commandment when
                    he condemns Joshua for breaking it, and contrasts lethal
                    "Natural" disasters favorably with Joshua’s
                    "Unnatural" carnage describing the Lisbon earthquake as
                    "the Natural result of Sin" (E604/K388). In these notes Blake
                    is attempting to defend Paine at his weakest against Watson at his strongest,
                    for the Bishop is attacking the Deist claim—already refuted by
                        Hume<ref target="n27" type="note">5</ref>—that a flawless
                    creation reflects the perfection of its Maker. Blake, as Mark Roberts has
                    pointed out,<ref target="n28" type="note">6</ref> takes refuge in the
                    traditional Christian doctrine of the Fall. In his anxiety to vindicate Paine,
                    he retreats from the position which he otherwise maintains early and late<ref target="n29" type="note">7</ref> that the God of the first chapter of
                    Genesis is a corrupted spirit and he assesses even post-Adamic, fallen nature
                    with its destructive qualities as less morally deplorable than are wicked
                        men.<ref target="n30" type="note">8</ref> Towards the end of his
                    annotations, Blake momentarily steps out of his role as a defender of Paine and
                    exclaims, "The Bishop never saw the Everlasting Gospel any more than
                    Tom Paine" (E608/K394). The phrase "the Everlasting
                    Gospel" (from Revelation xiv.6) was, as A. L. Morton notes,<ref target="n31" type="note">9</ref> a term used by seventeenth-century English
                    antinomian sects to denote their doctrine, and Blake appropriates it for his own
                    version of Christianity, which is closely related to theirs but equally alien to
                    the orthodox and the Deists of his age. <note id="n27"><hi rend="s">5</hi> David

        <p>The distinction between the accusing, lawgiving God and the Divine Humanity (or
                    Poetic Genius) is essential to Blake’s Christianity from the early
                    1790s onwards. In <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> (c.
                    1790-1793), he identifies Jehovah, the Poetic Genius, with Energy, and Satan,
                    the Accuser of the Book of Job, with Reason. Although emotionally Blake leans
                    very heavily towards Energy, he admits that "Reason and Energy . . .
                    are necessary to Human existence" (E34/K149), for he is adapting
                    Boehme’s notion of a division of the primal unity into two Principles
                    as the basis of creation and also the source of evil. According to Boehme (in
                    Blake’s time known as Behmen), the two Principles can be represented
                    as Wrath, Fire, or the Power of God and as Love, Light, or the Heart of God, and
                    they are identical with the Father and Son of the Christian
                    Trinity—"The Father," states Boehme, "is
                    the eternal Power, or Virtue, and the Son is the Heart and Light. . . .
                    " When separated from the Light or Love, the Fire or Wrath becomes the
                    flames of Hell, yet on that Fire the existence of every created thing depends.
                    Without the Fire, Boehme asks, <q> where would be the Mobility, Kingdom, Power,
                        and Glory? Therefore we have often said, The Anger is the Root of Life; and
                        if it be without the Light, then it is not God, but Hell Fire; but if the
                        Light shines therein, it becomes Paradise and Fulness of Joy. </q> Either of
                    these Principles is incomplete without the other: <q> Indeed <hi rend="i">All</hi> is from one Eternal Original, but it severizes itself into a
                            <hi rend="i">twofold</hi> Source; a Similitude whereof we have in the
                        Fire, and Light; where the Fire is painful and <hi rend="i">consuming</hi>,
                        and the Light meek and giving; and yet the one were a Nothing without the

                    had by then come to follow Boehme in associating the First and Second Principles

                        <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Urizen (an individual) fades into the
                    background being displaced respectively by Satan (a state) and the Spectre of
                    Albion (who is also Satan), in whom the forces that work against a return to the
                    prelapsarian unity are focused: in these poems Satan—the Accuser as
                    distinct from the Miltonic rebel—confronts the Trinity. <note id="n34"><hi rend="s">12</hi> Only semi-Gnostic because Los voluntarily

        <p>The earliest sign that Blake is recovering his interest in the Trinity is a
                    reference to the Holy Spirit (E604/K387) in his annotations, dated 1798, to
                    Watson’s <hi rend="i">Apology for the
                    Bible</hi>—annotations which, with their allusions to
                    Blake’s professing himself a Christian, to the Everlasting Gospel,
                    and to the forgiveness of sins—adumbrate much in his later work. A
                    second mention of the Third Person occurs at the end of his letter of 30 January
                    1803 to James Blake (E696/K822), and in a late or relatively late addition to
                    Night VIIA of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> Enitharmon laments, "Such
                    is our state nor will the Son of God redeem us but destroy"<ref target="n36" type="note">14</ref> (E355/K331). In 1807, Blake represented
                    all three Persons of the Trinity in his painting <hi rend="i">The Fall of
                        Man.</hi><ref target="n37" type="note">15</ref> His many subsequent

        <p>In Blake’s fully developed myth, as in Boehme, the primal division is
                    not the gulf between God and the Accuser but a separation within the Godhead
                    Itself. The perfect harmony among the Eternals, who are at once a multitude and
                    a single being,<ref target="n38" type="note">16</ref> does not always prevail
                    even between the Father and the Son, and there are signs that each can be
                    imperfect when sundered from the other. <note id="n38"><hi rend="s">16</hi>
                            Cf., for example, <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, Night the First: <q>
                                Then those in Great Eternity met in the Council of God<lb/> As one
                                Man for contracting their Exalted Senses<lb/> They behold Multitude

                            error to declare on the brink of his fall, "We are not One: we
                            are Many" (<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 4:23;
                        E145/K622).
                    </note></p>
        <p>There is abundant evidence, both visual and textual, that Blake in his later
                    phase conceives of the Father divorced from the Son as possessing cruel,
                    tyrannical, and destructive attributes. To begin with the paintings, on the left
                    (the sinister side) of the Father at the top of the <hi rend="i">Epitome of

                    inscribes the text—non-biblical though related to Deuteronomy iv.24

                    flames radiating from the Father, and the latter holds the scepter of worldly
                    power which Satan bears in <hi rend="i">The Great Red Dragon and the Beast from
                        the Sea</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Number of the Beast is 666</hi> (both c.

                    a change. In the fourth painting, <hi rend="i">Christ Offers to Redeem Man</hi>,
                    the Father, who embraces the Son, is wingless and, judging from the vacant space
                    on the left of his right hand and forearm, beardless; light radiates from the
                    place where the heads of the Father and Son meet and, like the light in <hi rend="i">Jacob’s Ladder</hi> (c. 1805),<ref target="n43" type="note">21</ref> it progressively darkens as it travels down the picture
                    away from the eternal realm. In the fifth painting, <hi rend="i">Satan’s and Raphael’s Entries into Paradise</hi>, the
                    Father, now cut off from the Son, has become a winged, bearded, Urizenic god
                    hovering over Raphael.<ref target="n44" type="note">22</ref> The sky again grows
                    gradually darker towards the bottom, but though there is still radiance from the
                    Father it is much paler than in the previous illustration and, except for a
                    narrow area immediately above his head, it is streaked with dull yellow-green
                    stripes. This winged figure descends from the image of Urizen which Blake
                    incorporated in 1791 (before he had named the god) in his engraving <hi rend="i">The Fertilization of Egypt</hi> based on a rough sketch by Fuseli.<ref target="n45" type="note">23</ref> It has a successor in the drooping deity
                    who presides over Blake’s ninety-seventh illustration to <hi rend="i">The Divine Comedy</hi> (1824-1827).<ref target="n46" type="note">24</ref> A
                    comparable contrast may be present within a single painting, <hi rend="i">The

                    Death—seated in the cave between Sin and Hell, the figures being
                    identifiable from Blake’s description (E662/K441) and from one of his
                    paintings of <hi rend="i">Satan, Sin and Death</hi> (c. 1808)<ref target="n48" type="note">26</ref>—could well be a degenerate form of the
                    Father above. The latter has spiky hair like that of the deity in plate 2 of
                    Blake’s <hi rend="i">Illustrations of The Book of Job</hi>
                    (1825)—spikes which, as Bo Lindberg has noticed,<ref target="n49" type="note">27</ref> turn out to have been a sign of the bearer’s
                    Satanic character as they develop into the hideous projections from the
                    Devil’s head in plate 11. If the Father has indeed fallen to become
                    Death, he has acquired in his descent stylized wings and an iron crown, and his
                    beard has shrunk, but his hands and outstretched arms retain their pose (the
                    Urizenic pose of their counterparts in <hi rend="i">The Fertilization of
                        Egypt</hi>), his left foot remains a little in front of his right, and his
                    head still inclines to one side—now his right instead of his left. In
                    the complex pattern of the painting, the Father is separated from the Son, the
                    rebel from the heavenly angels, mankind from Paradise, and Paradise from the

        <p>Verbal references to the degeneration of the Father when He is cut off from the
                    Son are also plentiful. A famous passage in "A Vision of the Last
                    Judgment" caustically declares: <q> Thinking as I do that the Creator
                        of this World is a very Cruel Being &amp; being a Worshipper of Christ
                        I cannot help saying the Son O how unlike the Father First God Almighty

                    reunited with the Son in the Christian dispensation, he repents. Similarly, we
                    need no longer be surprised that the lawgiving God should be identified with the

        <p>The names Elohim, Jehovah, and Jesus appear in the list of the Seven Eyes of God
                    which is given in each of Blake’s three epics (E366, 106, 202/K351,
                    494, 686). It is widely agreed that the Eyes—Lucifer, Molech, Elohim,
                    Shaddai, Pa(c)had, Jehovah, and Jesus—constitute seven historical
                    (and religious) periods.<ref target="n51" type="note">29</ref> Though they seem
                    to be individuals from the viewpoint of the Eternals who commission them as

                    E130/K521) to be states from mankind’s standpoint and to be subject

                    Eyes are Elohim and Jehovah, "Elohim" being a Hebrew plural
                    rendered as "God" in the Authorized Version and
                    "Jehovah" a faulty transliteration of the sacred name piously
                    rendered as "the Lord." Blake frequently employs
                    "Elohim"—the only name used for God from Genesis
                    i.1 to Genesis ii.3—for the "Cruel Being" who is
                    "the Creator of this World,"<ref target="n53" type="note">31</ref> and in Night the Eighth of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, where
                    he first appears as the third Eye, he creates Adam to endure the sacrificial
                    death he himself shuns (E366/K351). In <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, however, Adam,
                    conceived as the Limit of Contraction, is defined or fashioned by "The
                    Divine hand" before Elohim descends (13:18-23; E106/K494). In <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, "Los who is of the Elohim" is
                    Adam’s maker (73:24-28; E226/K713). The fourth and fifth Eyes bear
                    the names Shaddai (Almighty) and Pa(c)had (Terror), which also denote the Hebrew
                    God, and indeed Thomas Altizer’s observation that the first six are
                    antithetical to the seventh<ref target="n54" type="note">32</ref> suggests that
                    all six may be aspects of the Father. Jehovah, the last of these six, becomes
                    "leprous," which recalls not only the Urizen of the earlier

                    "the Angel of Jehovah" and the Hebrew below as
                    "Jah" (an abbreviation for "Jehovah"), the

                    this Angel—who became the patron spirit of the Britain of the fallen
                    world with her oak groves—when they speak of "Jehovah

        <p>References to imperfection in the Son separated from the Father are rarer than
                    aspersions on the Father separated from the Son, but however much Blake, like
                    Boehme, leans emotionally towards the Son, as he leaned towards Energy in <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, they do occur. In
                    conversation with Crabb Robinson, Blake stated that Christ was <pb id="p15-19" n="19"/> wrong to attack the Government and to allow himself to be
                    crucified. On being asked how error was consistent with Christ’s
                    divinity he replied, "He was not then become the father,"<ref target="n60" type="note">38</ref> indicating that the separation of the
                    Persons had led to a temporary lapse from perfection. On a later occasion, he
                    told Robinson that Christ was wrong to expel the money-changers from the Temple,
                    that he "took much after his Mother And in so far he was one of the
                    worst of men,"<ref target="n61" type="note">39</ref> and in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Los says of him, "by his Maternal Birth he
                    is that Evil-One" (90:35; E247/K736). It is part of Christ’s
                    sacrifice to assume from his mother the corruption of the Natural Man, which he
                    must then put off before he can again become one with the Father. The point is
                    repeated in "The Everlasting Gospel": <q> He took on Sin in
                        the Virgins Womb<lb/> And put it off on the Cross &amp; Tomb<lb/>
                        (E515/K749) </q> In this poem Jesus, though dear to Blake, is not flawless.
                    The Father, Himself vindictive in His separation from the Son ("Gods
                    Mercy &amp; Long Suffering / Is but the Sinner to Judgment to

                    self-sacrifice, is not perfect, for the Seven Eyes have to unite with each other
                    and with the Eighth, the sleeping Humanity, to become "One Man Jesus

                        "Know that after Christs death, he became Jehovah"

                        from all encumbrances." The fact that Milton’s Satan is
                        Messiah from the biblical viewpoint and that Jesus acts "from
                        impulse. not from rules" (E42/K158) supports this view.</note><note id="n61"><hi rend="s">39</hi> Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, p.

                        earlier Jesus displays a wrath which might be thought more
                        characteristic of the Father; however it is not here contended that
                        Blake’s Father and Son embody precisely the qualities of
                        Boehme’s First and Second Principles, but that, like those
                        Principles, each is incomplete and therefore imperfect without the

        <p>Blake uses "the Names Divine / Of Jesus &amp; Jehovah"
                    (E266/K771) in two ways. Sometimes—as in the Prologue to <hi rend="i">The Gates of Paradise</hi>, the <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi>, and
                    the second Job engraving—"Jehovah" denotes the
                    Father separated to a greater or lesser extent from the Son. More often, this
                    sacred name is reserved for the Divine Humanity, who can manifest as Father,
                    Son, or Holy Spirit, but in whom the Father and Son <figure><head>6 Blake, <hi rend="i">Illustrations for The Book of Job</hi> (1825),

                    Western tradition, proceeds from the Father and the Son, there is no question of
                    its becoming cut off or incomplete.) It is Jehovah the Divine Humanity whose
                    Covenant is the forgiveness of sins,<ref target="n65" type="note">43</ref> whose
                    Spirit is the Divine Mercy,<ref target="n66" type="note">44</ref> whose visions
                    inspire the poet,<ref target="n67" type="note">45</ref> and who, as the Father,
                    "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain
                    on the just and on the unjust."<ref target="n68" type="note">46</ref>
                    In the fragmentary illuminated manuscript of the early chapters of Genesis that
                    Blake prepared in his last years, he tries to distinguish the fierce, fallen
                    Elohim from the merciful Jehovah. He inserts each of these names once, and only
                    once, in the King James text, making the serpent promise Eve "ye shall
                    be as Gods (Elohim)" (iii.5) and making Eve acknowledge after
                    Cain’s birth, "I have gotten a man from Jehovah"
                    (iv.1). Jehovah also appears, standing opposite Christ, on both versions of the
                    title-page preceding the text, where the Holy Ghost strides over their heads
                    emphasizing the balance between them. However, some of the drawings (often
                    indistinct) which punctuate the text show the Elohim—the Father
                    separated from the Son and often accompanied by two angels—creating
                    first the universe and then, probably, Adam, from whom he splits off Eve. The
                    final sketch seems to depict Jehovah, the Divine Humanity, kissing the brow of
                    Cain, over whose birth He presided and on whom He now places, as
                    Blake’s chapter heading tells us, the mark of forgiveness.<ref target="n69" type="note">47</ref><note id="n65"><hi rend="s">43</hi><hi rend="i"> Jerusalem</hi> 61:24-25 and 98:23, 45 (E210, 255/K694-95, 745,

        <p>Occasionally, as in "The Everlasting Gospel," Blake employs the
                    name Jesus for the Son severed from the Father, but usually he indicates by it
                    the Divine Humanity, in whom all the Persons are in fact comprehended. Thus
                    Blake’s rendering of the Lord’s Prayer can begin
                    "Jesus our Father who art in thy Heavns call’d by thy Name
                    the Holy Ghost" (E658/K788), and in plate 3 of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> he speaks of "Jesus our Lord, who is the God of
                    Fire and Lord of Love" (E144/K621) showing that in this Jesus, as
                    Morton Paley observes, Boehme’s First and Second Principles
                        coalesce.<ref target="n70" type="note">48</ref> Marrying word and image,
                    Blake uses the quotations from John x and xiv in the lower margin of his
                    seventeenth illustration to Job to show that within the Father who appears in
                    this and the four preceding plates the Son also is present. In the Rosenwald
                    drawing of the Last Judgment (c. 1810), some of the divisions represented in <hi rend="i">The Fall of Man</hi> are healed: at the top of the design human
                    beings, as Blake tells us (E552/K613), are again in Paradise, and the Father is
                    reunited with the Son in the person of Jesus sitting on Jehovah’s
                        throne.<ref target="n71" type="note">49</ref> In conceiving the Godhead
                    thus, Blake is following Swedenborg, who condemned conventional Trinitarianism
                    as tritheistic and held that the three Persons were all present in Christ, whom
                    he regarded as the incarnation of Jehovah.<ref target="n72" type="note">50</ref><note id="n70"><hi rend="s">48</hi><hi rend="i"> Energy and Imagination</hi>, pp. 257-58. Damon finds here

                        this combination of wrath and love with the division of wrath from pity on

                            Tradition</hi>, II, 202) make some of these points. Morton D.
                        Paley—"‘A New Heaven is Begun’:
                        William Blake and Swedenborgianism," <hi rend="i">Blake: An
                            Illustrated Quarterly</hi>, 13 (Fall 1979), 64-90—observes
                        that Blake’s interest in Swedenborg seems to have revived around
                        1800, which is about the time that he showed a renewed awareness of the
                        Trinity.</note></p>
        <p>Being a poet and artist, Blake thinks primarily in images and is less concerned
                    with strict consistency than is a philosopher. Nevertheless, when he is first
                    overwhelmed by the horrors of Experience he begins a long search for a coherent
                    solution to the problem of evil. Passing through non-dualism and a
                    quasi-Gnosticism, he reaches his final position about 1800. Confronted with an
                    apparent contradiction at the heart of this position, a grossly inconsistent use
                    of the name Jehovah, critics have tended to be evasive or perfunctory. However,
                    an investigation of the problem reveals that Blake develops a daring theology
                    rooted in Boehme to enable him to sustain with equal fervor a passionate
                    devotion to the Trinitarian God of Christianity and an unremitting protest
                    against the life-denying cruelty of the moral law and the created universe.</p>

        <p><hi rend="i">Works of William Blake</hi>, bearing no publisher’s
                    imprint and dated 1876 on its title page, has posed a minor conundrum in Blake
                    scholarship. The title page announces it as "Reproduced in Facsimile
                    From the Original Editions. One hundred copies printed For private
                    circulation." It is a facsimile of very poor quality, yet it made
                    available for the first time complete reproductions of <hi rend="i">Songs of
                        Innocence and of Experience, The Book of Thel, Visions of the Daughters of
                        Albion, America, Europe, The Book of Urizen</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The Song
                        of Los.</hi> These were not to appear in facsimile again until William
                    Muir’s considerably better productions of 1884-90.<ref target="n73" type="note">1</ref> Thus <hi rend="i">Works</hi> has some historical
                    importance as a pioneering albeit seriously flawed project, but the
                    circumstances of its publication have never been made clear up to now. In the
                    Keynes <hi rend="i">Bibliography</hi> it is assigned to the publisher F. S.
                        Ellis,<ref target="n74" type="note">2</ref> while the Bentley <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> gives no publisher for <hi rend="i">Works</hi> under the
                    main entry and assigns the facsimiles to John Pearson in individual entries for
                    each illuminated book.<ref target="n75" type="note">3</ref> In "A

                    that "The sponsor, who is not identified in the book, may be Andrew
                    Chatto." It now can be shown that the publisher was definitely Chatto
                    and Windus, that the actual date of publication was 1878, and that <hi rend="i">Works</hi> was probably the abortive result of an ambitious plan for a
                    complete Blake facsimile originally conceived by John Camden Hotten. <note id="n73"><hi rend="s">1</hi><hi rend="i"> The Edition of the Works of William Blake</hi> (Edmonton: The

        <p>In 1868 John Camden Hotten published the first complete facsimile of one of
                    Blake’s illuminated books, <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and
                        Hell.</hi> As I have shown elsewhere, this was intended as the first volume
                    in a series which Hotten announced as "facsimile copies (exact as to
                    paper, printing—the water-colour drawings being filled in by an
                    artist) of the ORIGINAL EDITIONS of the books written and illustrated by William
                        Blake."<ref target="n76" type="note">4</ref> This plan was
                    evidently set back by the sudden death in 1868 of Hotten’s artist,
                    Henry John Bellars. It appears that Hotten had difficulty in finding another
                    facsimilist of Bellars’ skill, for on 8 September 1870 Hotten wrote
                    to the printers Banks &amp; Co.: "I may ask if you have an artist
                    who can successfully reduce Cruikshank’s etchings &amp; draw on
                    stone (or engrave), the printing to be done in colours like the plates to <hi rend="i">Tom and Jerry.</hi>"<ref target="n77" type="note">5</ref>
                    When Hotten died in 1873 at the age of forty, no further Blake facsimiles had
                    been issued. <note id="n76"><hi rend="s">4</hi> See my article "John

        <p>After Hotten’s death, a chestful of drawings after Blake, some of
                    which may have been studies by Bellars for the projected facsimile, was found in
                    Hotten’s cellar. These drawings were bought by the New York dealer J.
                    W. Bouton and offered for sale as genuine Blakes, laying the ground for the
                    story of the "John Camden Hotten forgeries." Meanwhile
                    Hotten’s business was acquired by his former publishing associate
                    Andrew Chatto, who was joined in partnership by W. E. Windus. The plan for an
                    extensive Blake facsimile was not abandoned, and in the following year
                    considerable progress was made on it. On 17 September 1874 Chatto wrote to
                    William Michael Rossetti, who had assisted Hotten with his Blake projects: <q>

                    of "Blake reproductions" to be printed by Banks and that on 26
                    January 1878, 103 printed sets were dispatched to the binder Sotheran.<ref target="n78" type="note">6</ref> That this was a lithographic reproduction

                    previously been used for printing bonds. The word could equally be
                    "bands," but this makes no sense). The costs were
                    £100—a surprisingly large sum, especially in view of the poor
                    quality of the work—paid to an unnamed artist, £37/10 for
                    printing and £21 for binding. The disposition of stock is not indicated, an
                    unusual feature in these meticulously kept ledger books. <note id="n78"><hi rend="s">6</hi> Ledger 3, p. 185. The Huntington Library copy of <hi rend="i">Works</hi> bears the stamp of the binder Bone, who also worked
                        extensively for Hotten and for Chatto. It may be that Sotheran farmed out
                        some of the binding to Bone.</note></p>
        <p>In their list for 1877, Chatto and Windus advertised the facsimile as follows: <q><hi rend="i">Blake’s Works</hi><lb/><lb/> A series of

                            Albion." The latter was published in 1793, not 1789; <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> bears the publication date 1789 and
                            not 1794; and <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> was published in 1795
                            not 1794. For some reason <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi>, the sole
                            known copy of which had been sold to the British Museum in 1866, was not
                            part of the plan. Neither was <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi>, the
                            sole known copy of which was then in the collection of Lord Houghton.
                            The first facsimiles of these two books were published by E. J. Ellis
                            and W. B. Yeats in volume III of <hi rend="i">The Works of William
                                Blake, Poetic, Symbolic and Critical</hi> (London: B. Quaritch,
                            1893).</note></q> Apparently the advertisement was issued before Bouton had seen a copy of
                        <hi rend="i">Works</hi>, since the facsimile is <hi rend="i">not</hi>
                    "in the original colors," though Chatto had intended that it
                    be. When Bouton advertised <hi rend="i">Works of William Blake</hi> in his
                    catalogue 63 (c. 1885), the wording was almost identical with that of catalogue
                    56, but mention of color was omitted.</p>
        <p>With this information in mind, we are in a position to reconstruct the
                    circumstances leading to the publication of <hi rend="i">Works.</hi> The
                    facsimile scheme was initiated by John Camden Hotten and taken over after
                    Hotten’s death by his successor Andrew Chatto. Some proofs were ready
                    in September 1874. Publication was anticipated for 1876, for a letterpress title
                    page bearing that date was printed. (The absence of a publisher’s
                    imprint is not inconsistent with the practice of the time: neither
                    Hotten’s 1868 <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> nor Pearson’s
                    1877 <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> bears one.) The plan was to issue a
                    hand-colored facsimile, and some colored proofs may have been prepared, but
                    possibly owing to the poor quality of the facsimile work, the book was issued
                    uncolored and reduced in its scope. <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and
                        Hell</hi>, still available in Hotten’s edition, was left out, and
                    so were Blake’s two longest illuminated books, <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> The collection was published
                    in a single volume in 1878.</p>
        <p><hi rend="i">Works by William Blake</hi> comprises facsimiles of six of
                    Blake’s illuminated works, as follows:</p>
        <p>1. <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, 55 leaves <pb id="p15-26" n="26"/><figure><head>3 Freehand drawing of an enlarged detail from plate 18, copy F.</head><figDesc>In the original the cloth is colored pink.</figDesc></figure><figure><head>2 <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, plate 17.</head><figDesc>From 1876 <hi rend="i">Works</hi> (where it is numbered 15). By
                            permission of the Huntington Library, San Marino, California.</figDesc></figure> (including the rejected "A Divine Image"). The
                    foliation corresponds to that of no known original copy: no <hi rend="i">Songs
                        of Innocence</hi> ends in "Laughing Song," and in <hi rend="i">Works</hi> the "Introduction" to <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> comes not at the beginning but after seventeen
                    other poems! The inclusion of "A Divine Image," makes it
                    likely that the original used was, as Bentley (<hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, p.
                    426) suggests, copy a, which had been sold to the British Museum by B. M.
                    Pickering in 1864. "Laughing Song," missing from copy a, could
                    have been supplied from copy T, in the British Museum since 1856. However, Dr.
                    David Bindman informs me that copy BB, recently sold in London, also contains
                    "A Divine Image." This copy must therefore be considered an
                    alternative source. Its location was unknown from 1830 on.</p>
        <p>2. <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi>, 8 leaves. Copy D, in the British Museum
                    Print Room since 1856, had already been used for the reproduction of the <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> title page in A. C. Swinburne’s <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi>, published by Hotten in 1868. Presumably copy D was also
                    used for <hi rend="i">Works.</hi></p>
        <p>3. <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>, 11 leaves. Two copies, A
                    and B, were in the British Museum Print Room. Presumably one of these was used.
                    According to Bentley (<hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, p. 473), it was B.</p>
        <p>4. <hi rend="i">America</hi>, 18 leaves. The clue to identification here is the
                    number of tails on the serpent in plate 13. In the various original copies, the
                    serpent has either three tails or one. The serpent of <hi rend="i">Works</hi>
                    has three, and so must derive from one of the following copies: E, F, G, I, K,
                    or L. Bentley (<hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, p. 102) suggests that copy F,
                    acquired by the British Museum in 1859, was the one used.</p>
        <p>5. <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, 17 leaves. In <hi rend="i">Works</hi> the
                    "Ancient of Days" frontispiece is placed after the title page
                    by mistake. Page 3, found only in copies H and K, is not present. A very likely
                    source is copy D (as Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, p. 181, suggests);
                    this had also been acquired by the British Museum in 1859. There is, however,
                    one other possibility—copy F. In plate 18 (numbered 15 in <hi rend="i">Works</hi>) of the facsimile a garment obscures the penis of the
                    male figure. This may well be a concession to Victorian prudery, but it may be
                    significant that the penis is similarly obscured in copy F. (Owing to the
                    fragility of the original, it has not been possible to obtain a <pb id="p15-27" n="27"/> photograph, but I have made a freehand drawing of this detail.) In
                    the other copies, the male figure is nude, though as Bentley (<hi rend="i">Blake
                        Books</hi>, p. 156) notes, "In copy D there are lines on the
                    man’s left hip as if to represent cloth, but the cloth is not
                    colored." Copy F was acquired in 1866 by B. M. Pickering. Pickering
                    later sold it to an unknown collector whose monogram was D W J. It is now in the

        <p>As we have seen, it is virtually certain that the records in the Chatto and
                    Windus ledger entry headed "Blake reproductions" refer to the
                    "1876" <hi rend="i">Works.</hi> One other hypothesis
                    concerning these records should be mentioned here. <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>
                    assigns the facsimile of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> hitherto attributed to John
                    Pearson to Chatto and Windus on the basis of this same ledger entry.<ref target="n81" type="note">9</ref> However, it seems incontrovertible that
                    John Pearson did in fact produce the photolithographic black-and-white facsimile
                    of copy D of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> in 1877. Two reliable sources indicate
                    this. John Muir, in a prospectus included with his facsimile of <hi rend="i">The
                        Song of Los</hi> (1890), asserts that he has not published a <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> because Pearson has already done so. As Pearson acted as the
                    distributor of Muir’s first four Blake facsimiles in 1884,<ref target="n82" type="note">10</ref> Muir was surely in a position to know who
                    had published <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> in 1877. Furthermore, E. W. <figure><head>4 William Muir’s advertisement for <hi rend="i">The Edition

                    Harvard University Library), wrote: "Blake’s
                    ‘Jerusalem’ was reproduced by John Pearson, book-seller of
                    London. A Copy of this reproduction is in the Boston Public Library. I have
                    compared the reproduction carefully page by page with my original hand tinted

                        Blake,<ref target="n84" type="note">12</ref> to misrepresent the origin of
                    the <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> facsimile. It should therefore be restored to

            <p>If you were asked to name the significant minor writers of the Romantic
                            period, you would probably think of Southey or Crabbe or even John Clare
                            before James Montgomery. And yet, in his day Montgomery was known in
                            England and America as a poet, essayist, and humanitarian. His popular
                                <hi rend="i">Wanderer of Switzerland</hi>, a tribute to the fight
                            against French tyranny, inspired Byron to claim that it was
                            "worth a thousand ‘Lyrical Ballads’ and
                            at least fifty ‘degraded epics.’"<ref target="n85" type="note">1</ref> Although Byron’s
                            enthusiasm was extravagant, the historical and social range of
                            Montgomery’s work and his relationship to the major English
                            Romantics make him interesting to modern critics. <note id="n85"><hi rend="s">1</hi> See Byron’s notes to <hi rend="i">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</hi> in <hi rend="i">Byron:

                                York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1970), p. 866.</note></p>
            <p>The Garland Publishing Company’s five-volume facsimile edition
                            allows us to view Montgomery’s works in their original form,
                            with the poet’s prefaces and dedications, as well as with
                            illustrations by contemporary engravers.<ref target="n86" type="note">2</ref> While British and American collections of Montgomery are
                            available in most university libraries, the originals are rare.
                            Furthermore, with facsimiles, we can appreciate the poems as books that,
                            like the <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> and the
                                <hi rend="i">Lyrical Ballads</hi>, were designed to have a certain
                            impact on an audience. <note id="n86"><hi rend="s">2</hi> The volumes
                                are part of a Garland Series, Significant Minor Poetry, 1789-1831,
                                ed. Donald H. Reiman. All quotations from Montgomery’s
                                poetry refer to this edition and will be cited by line or
                                page.</note></p>
            <p>The Garland reproductions do not necessarily represent the poems that
                            Montgomery thought to be his best and collected in his <hi rend="i">Poetical Works of James Montgomery</hi> (1836). Nor do the volumes
                            include the works for which Montgomery is best remembered today, the
                            Christian hymns and imitations of psalms.<ref target="n87" type="note">3</ref> They emphasize instead Montgomery’s relationship
                            to the themes and commitments of the English Romantics: <hi rend="i">Prison Amusements</hi> are written when Montgomery is imprisoned
                            for libel during the repressive 1790s; <hi rend="i">The Wanderer of
                                Switzerland</hi> reflects disillusionment with the course of the
                            French Revolution; <hi rend="i">The West Indies</hi> celebrates the
                            abolition of the slave trade in England in 1807; and <hi rend="i">The
                                World Before the Flood</hi> is Montgomery’s
                            self-consciously Miltonic poem. <note id="n87"><hi rend="s">3</hi> The
                                    <hi rend="i">Greenland</hi> volume does contain some religious
                                poems, but neither Montgomery’s <hi rend="i">Christian
                                    Psalmist</hi> nor his <hi rend="i">Songs of Zion</hi> is
                                reprinted.</note></p>
            <p>Donald H. Reiman’s editorial choices generally make sense from
                            this perspective, although I wonder why the <hi rend="i">Verses to the
                                Memory of the Late Richard Reynolds</hi> (1816) were reproduced with
                                <hi rend="i">The World Before the Flood</hi> (1813), since the poems
                            offer nothing but sincere praise for a pious Quaker from Bristol.
                            Perhaps instead of these <hi rend="i">Verses</hi>, the series could have
                            included <hi rend="i">Pelican Island</hi> (1827),
                            Montgomery’s last long poem and his only venture in blank
                            verse. Also, the facsimiles, necessarily without modern editorial
                            comments, would be more useful with new, separate introductions covering
                            the material in each volume, instead of Reiman’s general
                                essay.<ref target="n88" type="note">4</ref><note id="n88"><hi rend="s">4</hi> I depend on John Holland and James

                                speeches, and editorials, as well as for anecdotes, comments, and
                                letters by others concerning Montgomery. I refer to this work by

            <p>Montgomery was born in Scotland in 1771, the son of Moravian
                            missionaries. When he was six years old, his parents left for the West
                            Indies after placing him in the Moravian School at Fulneck near <pb id="p15-29" n="29"/><figure/> Leeds. He excelled for a while, but became more dedicated to
                            poetry than to the required curriculum. After leaving Fulneck, trying
                            several jobs, and unsuccessfully peddling his poems in London,
                            Montgomery was hired as a clerk on the <hi rend="i">Sheffield
                                Register</hi> by the editor Joseph Gales. When Gales fled to America
                            in 1794 under the threat of political imprisonment, Montgomery took over
                            the paper, now the <hi rend="i">Sheffield Iris</hi>, and remained editor
                            until 1825. During these years and until his death in 1854, Montgomery
                            published several volumes of poetry, reviewed other poetry in the <hi rend="i">Eclectic Review</hi>, lectured on <hi rend="i">belles
                                lettres</hi> and literary history in London, and participated in the
                            workaday world of Sheffield.</p>
            <p>Such is the bare outline of Montgomery’s life. But Montgomery,
                            like Wordsworth, would no doubt have directed us to look for his life in
                            his works. The Garland facsimiles invite us to view the works
                            chronologically from <hi rend="i">Prison Amusements</hi> in the 1790s
                            through <hi rend="i">The Chimney Sweeper’s Friend and
                                Climbing Boy’s Album</hi>, published in 1824 a year
                            before his retirement from the <hi rend="i">Iris.</hi></p>
            <p>The first volume includes both <hi rend="i">Prison Amusements</hi> and
                                <hi rend="i">The Wanderer of Switzerland</hi>, the former published
                            in 1797 in London under the pseudonym Paul Positive as <hi rend="i">Prison Amusements, and Other Trifles: Principally written during
                                Nine Months of Confinement in the Castle of York.</hi> Montgomery
                            found himself in York Castle twice as a result of his position as editor
                            at a time when charges of libel and sedition were regularly leveled. But
                            Montgomery was not a Radical; the motto of the <hi rend="i">Iris</hi>
                            read "Ours are the plans of fair, delightful Peace, / Unwarped
                            by party rage, to live like brothers" (<hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi>, I, 175). Montgomery warned that the staff of the <hi rend="i">Iris</hi> "Have not scrupled to declare themselves
                                <hi rend="i">friends</hi> to the cause of <hi rend="i">Peace</hi>
                            and <hi rend="i">Reform</hi>, however such a declaration may be likely
                            to expose them in the present times of <hi rend="i">alarm</hi> to
                            obnoxious epithets and unjust and ungenerous reproaches. . . . they
                            scorn the imputations which would represent every reformer as a Jacobin,
                            and every advocate for peace as an enemy to his King and
                            country" (<hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi>, I, 177).</p>
            <p>Although Montgomery commented bravely on politics in the <hi rend="i">Iris</hi>, his <hi rend="i">Prison Amusements</hi> deal neither
                            with the political climate nor with the events leading up to his
                            imprisonment. They are simply about passing the time in prison. In the
                            lyrics and verse epistles in the volume, Montgomery uses conventional
                            imagery and allegorical plot structures featuring free-spirited robins
                            and captive nightingales. Because his treatment of his situation is
                            superficial and his allegorical pose suggests a distance incompatible
                            with often inflated language, the poems remain trifles. Their occasion
                            may be curious and revealing, but the texts are limp.</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">The Wanderer of Switzerland and other Poems</hi>, published
                            in London and printed by Montgomery in 1806, has more life. Montgomery
                            wrote <hi rend="i">The Wanderer</hi> in a ballad meter and structured it
                            as a dialogue between a Swiss patriot forced to flee his homeland after
                            the French invasion and a hospitable Shepherd living "beyond
                            the frontiers." The theme of natural liberty against political
                            tyranny and what Daniel Parken of the <hi rend="i">Eclectic Review</hi>
                            termed Montgomery’s "warmth of sentiment"
                                (<hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi>, II, 84) attracted British readers. But
                            even the sympathetic Parken noted that the metrical style and debate
                            structure were monotonous in a long, six-part poem, and that
                            Montgomery’s expression was not "brilliant"
                                (<hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi>, II, 84). In the <hi rend="i">Edinburgh
                                Review</hi>, Francis Jeffrey was typically less charitable, charging
                            that "Mr. Montgomery has the merit of smooth versification,
                            blameless morality, and a sort of sickly affectation of delicacy and
                            fine feelings, which is apt to impose on the amiable part of the young
                            and the illiterate" (<hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi>, II, 133).</p>
            <p>Perhaps Montgomery himself best explains both the popularity of <hi rend="i">The Wanderer</hi> and its failings in a comment written
                            years later: "the original plan of a dramatic narrative for a
                            poem of any length beyond a ballad was radically wrong, and nothing
                            perhaps but a little novelty (now gone by) and the peculiar interest of
                            the subject—at once romantic and familiar to our earliest
                            feelings and pre-possessions in favour of liberty, simplicity, the
                            pastoral life, and the innocence of olden times—could have
                            secured to such a piece any measure of popularity" (<hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi>, III, 221). The form of <hi rend="i">The
                                Wanderer</hi> does seem wrong because the regularity of ballad
                            rhythms is not complemented by a sparce, fast-paced narrative of
                            events—the style of the traditional folk ballad debates, of
                            many of the <hi rend="i">Lyrical Ballads</hi>, and of
                            Montgomery’s own "Vigil of St. Mark." <pb id="p15-30" n="30"/> Furthermore, despite the debate structure, the
                            poem lacks dramatic development.</p>
            <p>In "The Vigil of St. Mark" (published with <hi rend="i">The Wanderer</hi>, pp. 137-46) Montgomery fuses ballad rhythms with
                            structural compression. This poem is based on a legend, which Keats used
                            in his fragmentary "Eve of St. Mark," that on this eve
                            the ghosts of all the people who will die in the coming year walk in a
                            gloomy procession. In Montgomery’s poem, a nobleman named
                            Edmund sees his love Ella in such a procession while he is away from
                            home; he arrives home to discover Ella’s funeral procession,
                            a scene described in eerie flashes of action and a quick rhythm: <q>
                                ‘Twas evening: all the air was balm,<lb/> The heavens
                                serenely clear;<lb/> When the soft magic of a psalm<lb/> Came
                                pensive o’er his ear.<lb/><lb/> Then sunk his heart; a
                                strange surmise<lb/> Made all his blood run cold:<lb/> He
                                flew,—a funeral met his eyes;<lb/> He
                                paused,—a death-bell roll’d. </q> The poem
                            then concludes with a vision of Edmund walking with Ella’s
                            ghost on each eve of St. Mark. Montgomery compresses the narrative but
                            suggests action by showing the result of events, their emotional
                            impact.</p>
            <p>There are other good poems in the volume, such as "The Common
                            Lot," but many of the pieces share the same weakness:
                            Montgomery presents a situation <figure/> as allegorical or metaphorical
                            and then explains it, making it so fixed and brittle that it loses
                            whatever imaginative freedom it had. In "The
                            Snow-Drop" (pp. 154-60), for example, the narrator discovers a
                            snowdrop on a walk and welcomes it as a harbinger of spring. But then
                            the power of the metaphor is explained away: <q> There is a Winter in my
                                soul,<lb/> The Winter of despair;<lb/> O when shall Spring its rage
                                controul?<lb/> When shall the SNOW-DROP blossom there? </q></p>
            <p>Despite its poetic weaknesses, <hi rend="i">The Wanderer of Switzerland
                                and other Poems</hi> established Montgomery as more than the editor
                            of the <hi rend="i">Iris.</hi> In response to this popularity, Robert
                            Bowyer of Pall Mall asked Montgomery to write a poem celebrating the
                            parliamentary bill outlawing the slave trade in England. Bowyer wanted
                            to publish a volume of several poems accompanied by engravings which
                            would illustrate selected passages. Long devoted to abolition and
                            remembering his parents who died helping slaves in the West Indies,
                            Montgomery wrote <hi rend="i">The West Indies</hi>, a poem which traces
                            the history of the slave trade from the days of Columbus to the present.
                            Besides Montgomery’s poems and engravings by Raimbach,
                            Scriven, and Worthington from illustrations by Smirke, the volume
                            includes shorter poems by James Grahame and Elizabeth Benger, as well as
                            prose sketches of the activities of Granville Sharpe, Thomas Clarkson,
                            and William Wilberforce. Bowyer’s idea was to produce a
                            magnificent volume founded on the principle of making the sister arts
                            "allies" in the cause of freedom. But the distance
                            between <pb id="p15-31" n="31"/> conception and execution was great, and
                            the relationship of poetry to illustration has nothing of the
                            imaginative tension of Blake’s illustrated poems. When the
                            book was finally published in 1809 after many printing delays and
                            problems with the engravers, it did not sell quickly, although
                            Montgomery’s later, less expensive edition of <hi rend="i">The West Indies</hi> had a wider circulation.</p>
            <p>The narrative of <hi rend="i">The West Indies</hi> wanders the globe as
                            Montgomery progresses through the history of the slave trade, showing
                            the degeneration that profiteering in human lives brought on master and
                            slave alike, the one a "tether’d tyrant of one
                            narrow span; The bloated vampire of a living man" (Part III,
                            11. 235-36) and the other "dead in spirit" and
                            "toil degraded" (Part IV, 1. 59). The poem ends
                            cheerfully with a vision of the entire world renovated from slavery to
                            freedom as a result of British leadership and the establishment of the
                            "church of God" (1. 266) in the wilderness. Choosing
                            to ignore the ambiguities surrounding the slavery debates, Montgomery
                            confidently sees the freedom of all men and women leading to the
                            millenium: <q> —All hail!—the age of crime and
                                suffering ends;<lb/> The reign of righteousness from heaven
                                descends;<lb/> Vengeance for ever sheathes the afflicting
                                sword;<lb/> Death is destroy’d, and Paradise
                                restor’d;<lb/> Man, rising from the ruins of his
                                fall,<lb/> Is one with GOD, and GOD is All in All.<lb/> (11. 279-84)
                            </q></p>
            <p>Although sincere and passionate, <hi rend="i">The West Indies</hi> often
                            lapses into long sermons on the plight of <figure/> slaves. Montgomery
                            is too eager for the poem to succeed as social history and rhetoric: he
                            even provides his own footnotes on such works as Clarkson’s
                                <hi rend="i">History of the Abolition</hi>, Captain
                            Stedman’s <hi rend="i">Narrative of a Five Years’
                                Expedition</hi> (which Blake illustrated), and Mungo
                            Parke’s <hi rend="i">Travels.</hi> Furthermore, the poem
                            suffers from typical formal ailments; Montgomery’s heroic
                            couplets are tiring and his explanations of conventional imagery
                            annoying: "Bondage is winter, darkness, death, despair /
                            Freedom the sun, the sea, the mountains, and the air" (Part I,
                            155-56).</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">The West Indies</hi>, which Romantically begins with the
                            origins of history and ends with the "New Creation,"
                            Montgomery planned a poem on a grand scale. Like his greater
                            contemporaries, he also wanted to write an epic poem; he judged his
                            lesser pieces the way Keats more wrongly judged his shorter works: as
                            trifles. Even as a schoolboy Montgomery tried to write
                            epics—one based on Genesis and Milton and the other on the
                            achievements of Alfred the Great. With the example of Milton always
                            before him, Montgomery longed to write of things yet unattempted in
                            prose or rhyme, even though he sensed early in his career that he might
                            never succeed.<ref target="n89" type="note">5</ref><note id="n89"><hi rend="s">5</hi> During his second imprisonment in
                                York Castle, Montgomery wrote to his friend Joseph Aston of
                                Manchester: "I determined to rival—nay
                                outshine—every bard of ancient or modern times! I have
                                shed many a tear in reading some of the sublimest passages in our
                                own poets, to think that I could not equal them. I planned and began
                                at least a dozen epic poems . . . " (<hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi>, I, 258-59).</note></p>
            <p><hi rend="i">The World Before the Flood</hi>, the major poem in the next
                            Garland volume, represents Montgomery’s attempt on a Biblical
                            theme. Inspired by the eleventh book of <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>,
                            Montgomery set out to write an account of the struggle between the
                            Patriarchs of God and the Giants of the Earth descended from Cain.
                            Montgomery borrows liberally from <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>,
                            often, it seems, relying on the <pb id="p15-32" n="32"/> associations
                            that readers would have with Milton’s imagery and scenes. For
                            instance, when Montgomery wants to underscore the moral and theological
                            confusion of the assembly of Giants, he reminds us of the discord of
                            Pandemonium: <q> A shout of horrible applause, that rent<lb/> The
                                echoing hills and answering firmament,<lb/> Burst from the
                                Giants,—where in barbarous state,<lb/> Flush’d
                                with new wine, around their king they sate;<lb/> A Chieftan each,
                                who, on his brazen car,<lb/> Had led a host of meaner men to
                                war.<lb/> (Canto 8, p. 146) </q> Montgomery wants to give the Giants
                            reality by using the Miltonic context, just as Milton brings the Fallen
                            Angels to life by identifying them with the pagan gods.</p>
            <p>In letters written at the time, Montgomery claimed that he was inspired
                            by Milton’s Enoch, one of the Just Men in <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>, a man like Abdiel and the poet-hero Milton, who
                            resists the temptations of cheap glory. But the focus in <hi rend="i">The World Before the Flood</hi>, as far as there is a center in
                            this loosely-constructed poem, is on Javan, the prodigal poet who
                            returned to the land of the Patriarchs after succumbing to temptations
                            of fame and glory. Montgomery was more attracted to the greater humanity
                            of the flawed poet than to the rock-like Just Man. Like Wordsworth, he
                            was moved by the human misery of the eleventh book, and like Keats, he
                            wanted to see more deeply into the human heart than Milton had.</p>
            <p>Montgomery does make the tensions in Javan’s heart seem real,
                            but the character probably interests us more because we view him as a
                            Romantic type, such as Byron’s Cain, than because of the
                            sustained power of Montgomery’s creation. Byron, in fact, may
                            have drawn on Montgomery’s Javan and Zillah for his
                            characters in <hi rend="i">Cain</hi>, although Montgomery creates an
                            orthodox and hopeful fiction. Montgomery’s characters enjoy
                            fellowship because they have first established their faith in a God whom
                            Byron’s Cain sees as an unacceptable tyrant and whom Byron
                            sees as a product of man’s alienation from his own
                            humanity.</p>
            <p>The two major interests in <hi rend="i">The World Before the Flood</hi>,
                            the story of Javan’s return and the fate of the Patriarchs
                            who are threatened by the hostile Giants, are not tightly interwoven.
                            Nor is Montgomery’s narrative skillful. The long stories of
                            the history of the race, including the last days of Adam and Eve, do not
                            have dramatic propriety; the storytelling is not structured so that
                            hearing a story changes the way a character looks at the world, as the
                            Bard’s Song inspires Milton in Blake’s <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> or the Wanderer’s tale affects the
                            poet in <hi rend="i">The Ruined Cottage.</hi> Javan has already returned
                            to the flock, at least emotionally, when the poem begins; he
                            doesn’t need to be moved to action by a story. Furthermore,
                            heroic couplets do not give Montgomery enough freedom for the extended
                            periods that add power and variety to long narrative verse.</p>
            <p>In the years that he was working on <hi rend="i">The World Before the
                                Flood</hi>, Montgomery considered himself an outcast. After
                            abandoning the Moravian religion of his youth, he lost direct contact
                            with church members, and, while he always considered himself a
                            Christian, he was troubled by restlessness and doubt. At the same time,
                            he yearned for fellowship with other Christians, for the communion and
                            community so central to the Moravian Brethren.<ref target="n90" type="note">6</ref> Perhaps we can see this yearning in the
                            character of Javan, who gives up what Milton calls "renown on
                            Earth" (<hi rend="i">PL</hi>, XI, 698) and returns to his
                            native land. In any event, in the year following the publication of <hi rend="i">The World Before the Flood</hi>, Montgomery officially
                            returned to the Moravian faith and remained an active member for the
                            rest of his life. <note id="n90"><hi rend="s">6</hi> In <hi rend="i">The

            <p>If <hi rend="i">The World Before the Flood</hi> is the story of the
                            prodigal’s return to his faith, Montgomery’s next
                            long poem, <hi rend="i">Greenland</hi>, is a tribute to the faithful,
                            the Moravian missionaries who were risking their lives in an
                            inhospitable land. Greenland—the poem and the
                            country—had been on Montgomery’s mind for years
                            before he finally published the poem as a fragment in 1819. The first
                            three cantos sketch the history of the Moravian church and the first
                            voyage to Greenland in 1733; the fourth and fifth cantos refer to the
                            lost Norwegian colonies of the tenth through fifteenth centuries. The
                            projected cantos were to have dealt with "that moral
                            revolution, which the gospel has wrought among these people, by
                            reclaiming them, almost universally, from idolatry and
                            barbarism" (Montgomery’s Preface, p. vi). Although
                            Montgomery’s reasons for not completing <hi rend="i">Greenland</hi> are unclear, this sketch should indicate the
                            difficulty of using such material with no central plot or character. The
                            most likely assumption is that Montgomery wanted to publish the
                            unfinished poem in order to bolster his campaign in the <hi rend="i">Iris</hi> to save the missions, and simply never returned to it. As
                            if to strengthen the impact of the poem as propaganda, the completed
                            cantos have long, detailed footnotes and appendices on the Moravians,
                            information that the reader of 1819 or today could gather more
                            efficiently from a history text. Such frequent and minute interruptions
                            destroy the rhythmical momentum of long narrative poetry.</p>
            <p>Despite these faults, <hi rend="i">Greenland</hi> does contain
                            imaginative descriptive passages: <q> On rustling pinions, like an
                                unseen bird,<lb/> Among the yards, a stirring breeze is heard;<lb/>
                                The conscious vessel wakes as from a trance,<lb/> Her colours float,
                                the filling sails advance;<lb/> While from her prow the murmuring
                                surge recedes:<lb/> —So the swan, startled from her nest
                                of reeds,<lb/> Swells into beauty, and with a curving chest,<lb/>
                                Cleaves the blue lake, with motions soft as rest.<lb/> (Canto III,
                                pp. 47-48) </q> What is most striking about Montgomery’s
                            imagery is the apparent influence of Shelley. Throughout <hi rend="i">Greenland</hi> Montgomery describes atmospheres full of energy and
                            movement: rushing meteors, powerful glaciers, expanding vapours,
                            crashing mountain ice, winds yelling like demons. The imagery of
                            Montgomery’s earlier poetry was more static and conventional;
                            but in <hi rend="i">Greenland</hi> his images reflect the harsh and
                            unyielding power of the natural world. Like Shelley in "Mont
                            Blanc" (published in 1817 at <pb id="p15-33" n="33"/><figure/> the end of the <hi rend="i">History of a Six Weeks’
                                Tour</hi>), Montgomery invokes geological time as well as human
                            history.</p>
            <p>But unlike Shelley, Montgomery did not abhor didactic poetry. He wrote
                                <hi rend="i">Greenland</hi> as veiled propaganda, and even more to
                            the point, he edited <hi rend="i">The Chimney Sweeper’s
                                Friend and Climbing Boy’s Album</hi> for the
                            "direct enforcement of reform."<ref target="n91" type="note">7</ref> This volume combines actual accounts of abuses
                            with selected poetry, all designed to prove what Montgomery states in
                            the Preface: <q> This book will exhibit such testimonies concerning the
                                subject, in all its bearings, as ought to satisfy the most
                                supercilious, obdurate, and prejudiced, that such an employment is
                                inhuman, unnecessary, and altogether unjustifiable. The barbarity of
                                the practice cannot be denied:—nor can it be mitigated,
                                for it is next to impossible to teach a child this trade at all,
                                without the infliction of such cruelties upon his person, as would
                                subject a master in any <hi rend="i">other</hi> business to the
                                discipline of Bridewell, were he to exercise the like on <hi rend="i">his</hi> apprentices. Nor can any necessity, except
                                that which is the tyrant’s pleas, be proved in support of
                                it. There are <hi rend="i">machines in use</hi>, with which
                                ninety-nine chimneys out of a hundred might be swept . . . (vi-vii)
                            </q> Montgomery proposes that the legislature "prohibit the
                            masters from taking any more children as climbers" (vii) and
                            replace human beings with machines. His central contrast recurs
                            throughout the volume: Parliament passed a bill outlawing the trade in
                            Negroes but it allows the trade in British children. <note id="n91"><hi rend="s">7</hi> I am refering to Shelley’s argument

            <p><hi rend="i">The Chimney Sweeper’s Friend</hi> consists of
                            pleas, testimonies, case histories, "true" stories,
                            medical reports, legal resolutions, and petitions; the <hi rend="i">Climbing Boy’s Album</hi> contains mostly poems (with
                            the exception of brief prose fictions and a dramatic sketch)
                            illustrating the misery of the "profession." For the
                                <hi rend="i">Album</hi> Montgomery solicited works from all over the
                            kingdom, getting many responses—mostly from sincere souls
                            rather than literary talents. Some declined to contribute on the grounds
                            that a poem on such a subject would be neither useful nor poetical:
                            Walter Scott responded with instructions (printed in
                            Montgomery’s general preface) for constructing chimney vents
                            so that very little soot accumulates, and what does accumulate can be
                            cleaned with a machine; Joanna Baillie said that such a collection of
                            poems "is just the way to have the whole matter considered by
                            the sober pot-boilers over the whole Kingdom as a fanciful and visionary
                            thing. I wish, with all my heart, that threshing-machines and
                            cotton-mills had first been recommended to monied men by poets"
                                (<hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi>, IV, 61). Nevertheless, Montgomery felt
                            that the two-part miscellany, which included three engravings by
                            Cruickshank, would attract readers in support of the cause. And, hoping
                            to interest the King more deeply in the plight of climbing boys,
                            Montgomery dedicated the volume to George IV.</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">The Chimney Sweeper’s Friend</hi> includes
                            graphic and gruesome details of such miseries as chimney
                            sweeper’s cancer (of the scrotum), permanently deformed
                            limbs, and stunted and crooked growth. The picture is grim: children as
                            young as four or five sold to a master, unwashed for as long as six
                            months, and starved so they would not grow and thrive. Masters were
                            known to stick pins in children’s feet or to light fires
                            under them so that they would climb narrow chimneys; the instances of
                            children dragged senseless out of chimneys either dead or soon to die
                            occurred frequently. The massive evidence against using children is
                            complemented by the testimony of George Smart, who invented and had been
                            using a machine for cleaning chimneys since 1803. But repeated testimony
                            proves that while machines existed, slavery was more profitable and some
                            Englishmen had more reverence for their chimneys than for the children
                            who swept them.</p>
            <pb id="p15-34" n="34"/>
            <p>Beyond testaments to physical injustices, the selections include subtle
                            personal observation. In an introductory address written by a Mrs. Ann
                            Alexander of York for a pamphlet on the subject, the writer pleads as a
                            mother to mothers: <q> Could we have endured the idea, that those who
                                had been nursed at our bosoms, with all a mother’s
                                tenderness; those who had repaid the toils of maternal solicitude
                                with the sweet smiles and endearing actions of unconscious
                                innocence; should, at the early age from five to seven years, when
                                probably their natural or acquired dread of darkness was in full
                                operation, be forced into the rough and obscure recesses of a
                                chimney, in the manner described in this pamphlet? (p. 86) </q> Such
                            a detail as the child’s fear of darkness adds poignancy to
                            the evident physical dangers of sweeping. Mrs. Alexander consistently
                            calls attention to the emotional deprivation of the children:
                            "As climbing boys are brought up under those who had their
                            feelings of tenderness early blunted by their disgusting profession,
                            and, who, probably have received little, if any, education themselves;
                            what means of improvement can we therefore suppose such masters will
                            provide for their apprentices?" (p. 88). This kind of life
                            blunts the feelings and affections associated with a child’s
                            development, so that he becomes deformed mentally as well as physically.
                            He is deprived of the natural bonds which connect children to a
                            responsive world.</p>
            <p>The theme of mental and emotional deprivation runs through the pieces in
                            the <hi rend="i">Climbing Boy’s Album.</hi> Many of the
                            fictions are based on actual accounts of children either stolen from
                            parents or sold by them to master sweeps. "The Lay of the Last
                            Chimney Sweeper" (pp. 369-77), dated optimistically in the year
                            1827, tells the story of a child who for a time enjoyed a healthy, free
                            childhood in his native glen; but when his father’s death
                            brought hard times, his mother made her way into the city and was
                            tricked and tempted into bartering her boy. <q> A sooty man, of mien
                                austere,<lb/> Pursued her steps behind:<lb/> Stern were his features
                                and severe,<lb/> And yet his words were kind.<lb/><lb/> Her boy
                                should learn his trade, he said,<lb/> Nor would he aught
                                withhold;<lb/> He’d lodge him, clothe him, give him
                                bread;—<lb/> He show’d the tempting gold. </q>
                            The lay typically contrasts natural love and country freedom with the
                            corruption of the city. The chimney sweep becomes the outcast from
                            society, marked by soot and deprived of fellowship.</p>
            <q> When too, upon the village green, among the lads I stand,<lb/> No
                            friendly voice my presence hails, I press no friendly hand;<lb/> I fain
                            would mingle in their sports, but, ah! my brow doth wear<lb/> A mark
                            that bids that noisy crew my converse to beware.<lb/> ("A
                            Ballad of the House-Tops," p. 360) </q>
            <p>Readers of this journal will be interested to find Blake’s
                            "Chimney Sweeper" from <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> in

                            Blake and Montgomery had no direct contact, although Montgomery was
                            familiar with some of Blake’s illustrations and owned a copy
                            of the illustrations to Blair’s <hi rend="i">The

                                may add, was extracted 35 years later in a curious little volume
                                (1824) of James Montgomery’s editing, as a friend of the
                                then unprotected Climbing Boys. It was entitled "The C.S.
                                ’s F. &amp; C. B. ’s A," a
                                miscellany of verse and prose, original and borrowed, with
                                illustrations by R. C. Charles Lamb, one of the living authors
                                applied to by the kind-hearted Sheffield poet, while declining the
                                task of rhyming on such a subject, sent a copy from the
                                "Songs of Innocence", communicating it as

                                Boy’s Album</hi> reminds us of Montgomery’s
                            commitment to both journalism and poetry, since some of the selections
                            were first printed in the <hi rend="i">Iris.</hi> This dual commitment
                            set him apart from many of his greater contemporaries. His work as an
                            editor stole time from poetic composition, and even when he finally gave
                            up the editorship of the <hi rend="i">Iris</hi>, he wrote essays,
                            lectured, and participated actively in religious and secular affairs.
                            Blake and Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats, put poetry first, since they
                            considered it the most powerful means of reform: the poet could hammer
                            away tyranny, sharpen the discriminating powers of the mind, legislate
                            quietly over the world. Perhaps Montgomery sensed that his poetry alone
                            could not have exerted a major influence on the spirit of the age.</p>
            <p>Montgomery failed because his poetry of sincerity lacks formal discipline
                            and depth of thought. His poems often lapse into a rhetorical and
                            preachy style that cannot rest in imaginative uncertainties; nor does he
                            create his own sustained, coherent poetic system. The faults of much of
                            his poetry resemble those named by Jeffrey in his review of <hi rend="i">The Excursion</hi> (<hi rend="i">Edinburgh Review</hi> [24] Nov.
                            1814): prolix and long-winded ideas without discipline. Overwhelmed by
                            the sentiments of <hi rend="i">The Wanderer of Switzerland</hi>, Byron
                            claimed in <hi rend="i">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</hi> that
                            Montgomery’s works "might have bloomed at

                                <hi rend="i">Edinburgh Review.</hi> We do not have to agree with
                            Byron to be grateful for the return of Montgomery’s works in

            <p>To consider Erasmus Darwin and Blake is to join the widening discussion
                            over Blake’s knowledge and use of Science, and the debate
                            over the sources of his information. This discussion has thus far found
                            its most extreme formulation in Donald Ault’s important book,
                                <hi rend="i">Visionary Physics.</hi> Ault’s book, it must
                            be said, leaves some incredulous readers with the impression that Blake
                            compassed the <hi rend="i">Principia</hi>—and while that may
                            be true, it is important for accepting Blake’s active use of
                            scientific ideas to realize that they were available through various and
                            more popular sources. If, for example, one stands the scientifically
                            acute Swedenborg on his head, as he did Newton, one ends up with a kind
                            of basic Newtonianism again: core ideas can be disseminated through
                            unlikely texts. Erasmus Darwin is similarly important for Blake
                            studies—turned on his head, considered in the light of what
                            he was attempting rather than the way it was realized, one could argue
                            that Darwin is the English poet contemporary with Blake who most shares
                            Blake’s breadth of vision and his aim of ushering in the
                            reign of "sweet science" (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi>
                                finis).<ref target="n94" type="note">2</ref> Whether or not Blake
                            actually works from some of Darwin’s images is not the real
                            issue here; what is important is that Darwin represents a conduit of the
                            latest scientific information easily available to Blake: "there
                            is no better way," writes one historian of the period,
                            "of ascertaining the state of science in 1789-90, or a more
                            agreeable one, than by consulting Darwin’s poems and his

                                Blake. For Desmond King-Hele, "Blake detested the

            <p>We can assume that Blake read <hi rend="i">The Loves of the Plants</hi>
                                (<hi rend="i">LP</hi>), as did nearly everyone else in 1789. It was
                            published by Joseph Johnson (as were Darwin’s succeeding
                            works) though an arrangement which Fuseli evidently helped to bring
                                about.<ref target="n96" type="note">4</ref> Two years later, Blake
                            undoubtedly had read the succeeding volume, <hi rend="i">The Economy of
                                Vegetation</hi> (<hi rend="i">EV</hi>, dated 1791, probably
                            published May 1792), since he engraved and in part designed several
                            plates for the first edition (another followed in a later edition).
                            These two titles represent, respectively, Part II (already in a third
                            edition) and Part I of <hi rend="i">The Botanic Garden</hi>, the order
                            of publication reflecting an astute marketing decision since the more
                            "scientific" Part I proved less spectacularly popular
                            than the sexual double-entendres of <hi rend="i">The Loves of the
                                Plants.</hi> Given this history, it seems probable that Blake also
                            read parts of <hi rend="i">Zoonomia</hi> (Z; 1794-96), the most
                            significant of Darwin’s mammoth prose works. Almost forgotten
                            today, <hi rend="i">Zoonomia</hi> enjoyed wide republication and

                            collapsed and his posthumous poem, <hi rend="i">The Temple of

            <p>Like Hayley, Darwin is little read today—poetically he seems
                            to merit regard mostly as a quintessential example of the diction
                            against which the "Preface" to <hi rend="i">Lyrical
                                Ballads</hi> exclaims.<ref target="n100" type="note">8</ref> But as
                            encyclopedias—and all three poems, with their indexes, their
                            very extensive Notes, and still more extensive Additional Notes force
                            that comparison—they are fascinating. And for the poet who,
                            as W. J. T. Mitchell reminds us, delights in encyclopedic form, Darwin
                            would represent a benighted but sincere fellow-traveller, some of whose
                            entries were worth studying. And with respect to the present viability
                            of Blake’s science-based imagery, it is significant that
                            Darwin was in fact one of the most knowledgable scientific intellects of
                            the age,<ref target="n101" type="note">9</ref> making reference to the
                            latest theoretical and experimental work in his poems and notes (for

                                may offer a place to start looking at Blake’s
                                "use" of Darwin. After the prayerful and oracular
                                declarations, the poem announces, "Begin with Tharmas
                                Parent power. darkning in the West" (4.5). We begin with
                                Tharmas, evidently, because of an action—his
                                darkning—and an attribution, "Parent
                                power." To begin this way is then to begin at the
                                beginning, but also to defer the question of origin: not the parent,
                                but the power of parenting or generating is at stake. This suggests
                                a curious reflection of a favorite, almost formulaic expression of
                                Darwin’s which appears first in the famous "Of
                                Generation" section in <hi rend="i">Zoonomia</hi> and then
                                twice in <hi rend="i">The Temple of Nature.</hi> In <hi rend="i">Zoonomia</hi> Darwin notes that Hume "places the
                                powers of generation much above those of our boasted reason; and
                                adds, that reason can only make a machine . . . but the power of
                                generation makes the maker." Darwin goes on to support
                                Hume’s conclusion "that the world itself might
                                have been generated rather than created, . . . increasing by the
                                activity of its inherent principles rather than by a sudden
                                evolution of the whole by the Almighty fiat." Darwin then
                                stops to interject, "—What a magnificent idea of
                                the infinite power of THE GREAT ARCHITECT! THE CAUSE OF CAUSES!

              <p>Also relevant in this context is Darwin’s notion of the
                                origin of life from a primordial muscular fibre; this argument is
                                detailed in <hi rend="i">The Temple of Nature</hi>, which tells that
                                "Imperious Man" "Arose from rudiments of
                                form and sense, / An embryon point, or microscopic ens!"
                                (I.313-14). A note explains "that all vegetables and
                                animals arose from such a small beginning, as a living point or
                                living fibre." Fibre is, one remembers, one of
                                Blake’s pervasive thematic conceptions: Tharmas asks
                                Enion why "every little fibre" of his soul is to
                                be examined, and soon after that the Parent power
                                falls—"he sunk down." Directly
                                following: <q> His spectre issuing from his feet in flames of
                                    fire<lb/> In gnawing pain drawn out by her lovd fingers every

                                    them. . . . (5.15-17) </q> Here the syntax indicates that his
                                spectre consists—in part—of the fibres of
                                nerve, vein, and lacteal which Enion weaves into "a form of
                                vegetation": "She drew the Spectre forth from
                                Tharmas in her shining loom / Of vegetation" (6.1-2). Blake
                                would not have been the first to connect the primordial fibre (line)
                                and the Parent power—shortly after <hi rend="i">Zoonomia</hi> was published, Richard Edgeworth wrote the author
                                to say that the attempted deistic cover-up did not deceive him:
                                "Your Ens Entium is the same as your living
                                filament—your God of God!" (cited in King-Hele,
                                p. 251). For Blake also they are the same: "this Spectre of
                                Tharmas / Is Eternal Death;" the present embodiment,
                                perhaps, of the Darwinian powers of life that "seize,
                                digest, secrete,—dispense / The bliss of Being to the
                                vital Ens" (<hi rend="i">TN</hi> I.149-50, cf. 446). The
                                creation of the circle of Destiny, the Ulro, the system of
                                generation is Blake’s beginning, the darkning of the
                                Parent power which underlies Darwin’s spurious homage to
                                an apparent "Parent of Parents" and governs his
                                self-confident vision of comprehensible, ultimate Nature.</p>
              <p>A further example may serve to characterize the spectral presence of
                                Darwin. In Canto III of <hi rend="i">The Temple of Nature</hi>: <q>
                                    "The GIANT FORM on Nature’s centre

                                Darwin’s beginning, in "Night the
                                Ninth" his ending commences where Darwin’s
                                leaves off: <q> Los his vegetable hands<lb/> Outstretchd his right

                                shows Los, Blake’s "giant form," trying
                                to engineer a Darwinian apocalypse—his vegetable hands
                                representing the admittedly grand extension of a vegetable
                                imagination ("Thus all the suns, and the planets, which

                                may resemble the present one, and at length undergo the same

                                Los’ dramatic action, after all, comes from being
                                "Terrified at Non Existence / For such they deemd the death

                                idea of planets born by explosions: a note adds, "If these

              <p>But three years later, Chapter I of <hi rend="i">The Book of

                                grander idea in the mind of Blake was first suggested in David
                                Worrall’s important and detailed discussion of
                                Blake’s adaption of Darwin’s geophysical
                                speculations—the second section of his "William
                                Blake and Erasmus Darwin’s <hi rend="i">Botanic
                                    Garden</hi>"<ref target="n110" type="note">18</ref> is
                                essential reading for any student of Blake. Darwin’s idea
                                of cosmogenic explosions involves volcanos and earthquakes:
                                "We can have no idea of a natural power, which could
                                project a Sun out of Chaos, except by comparing it to the explosions
                                or earthquakes owing to the sudden evolution of aqueous or of other
                                more elastic vapours; of the power of which under immeasurable
                                degrees of heat, and compression, we are yet ignorant" (<hi rend="i">EV</hi> I.105n.). A note on "Solar
                                Volcanos" suggests that "cavities are made in the
                                sun’s body by a process similar to our
                                Earthquakes" (<hi rend="i">EV</hi> Add. N. XV), and,
                                correspondingly, as the earth’s volcanos show its center
                                to consist of "a large mass of burning lava . . . . a
                                second sun,"<ref target="n111" type="note">19</ref>
                                "the first earthquakes, which produced immense changes in
                                the globe, must have been occasioned by central fires" (<hi rend="i">EV</hi> Add. N. VI). So in <hi rend="i">The French
                                    Revolution</hi>, already beginning Blake’s
                                correspondence between head and (astronomical) orb, the King of
                                France appears with "his forehead . . . in affliction, /
                                Like the central fire" (79-80). A striking instance of
                                geophysical dynamic was the creation of the moon: <q> And
                                    Earth’s hugh sphere exploding burst in

                                several times, first, as Worrall observes, in <hi rend="i">The
                                    French Revolution</hi> when Aumont "compares and dates
                                man’s first <hi rend="i">enslavement</hi> to changes in

                                nations" (211-12). In <hi rend="i">American</hi> the
                                "close hall of counsel"—the skull is

                                "built when the moon shot forth, / In that dread night when
                                Urizen call’d the stars round his feet."<ref target="n112" type="note">20</ref> One of the most intriguing
                                developments occurs in <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi>, where
                                Darwin’s cosmological dynamic seems to inform both
                                Urizen, "rent from [the] side" of Los,
                                "By earthquakes riv’n, belching sullen
                                fires" (6.4, 10.4); and Los, "His bosom
                                earthquak’d with sighs" (13.49) and then
                                dividing to produce the first female form—all on a stage
                                of the Void, "the endless Abyss of space" <pb id="p15-39" n="39"/> (15.10). As R. E. Simmons first noted,
                                these passages—which result in Urizen as a "clod
                                of clay" and the globe of blood or incipient female
                                "Wand’ring wide on the bosom of
                                night"—suggest "a geophysical theory of
                                the origin of the earth as a chunk of matter thrown off by the
                                    sun."<ref target="n113" type="note">21</ref> The
                                developing analogy can be pressed even further, for, as Darwin
                                illustrates, gravity was commonly imaged as a chain:
                                "Chain’d to one centre whirl’d the
                                kindred spheres" (<hi rend="i">EV</hi> II.91). So, directly
                                after being rent from the side of Los (/sol), Urizen is chained
                                up—in "chains of the mind" to be sure,
                                but also gravity (that serious matter). This points to the
                                ontological relation between present existence, enslaved, and
                                "creation," for in Eternity "Earth was
                                not: nor globes of attraction" (<hi rend="i">BU</hi> 3.36).
                                "Creation" was the fall from energy/imagination
                                into matter and its accompanying systems of gravity and space-time,
                                a conception which has roots in Swedenborg’s
                                science-based fantasy of the "spiritual" universe
                                mirrored by our tangible one. The important point, as Worrall
                                concludes, is that "After <hi rend="i">The French
                                    Revolution</hi>, Darwin’s geophysical speculations
                                are quickly absorbed into the expanding synthesis of
                                Albion’s Angel, Urizen, and Los, where the scientific
                                version of the relations of chaos, sun, and earth are freely
                                interchanged" (p. 417); this opens the way to one key
                                analogy guiding the cosmology of Blake’s
                                "cosmic" myth, an analogy which should somewhat
                                refocus our sense of Blake’s concerns. Los is, on <hi rend="i">one</hi> level, the actual sun; Urizen the Earth;
                                Enitharmon the moon.<ref target="n114" type="note">22</ref> The most

                                Unfortunately, D. C. Leonard<ref target="n115" type="note">23</ref>
                                uses relevant quotations to support forced relations. Darwin, to
                                repeat, is spectrally present in Blake—his importance
                                lies in the compendium of scientific imagery he offered rather than
                                in massive direct influence. Consider, for example, as Leonard does,
                                Darwin’s memorable lines on embryonic development as
                                exemplified in the crocodile. The passage itself, significantly, is
                                introduced to establish a comparison with seed development, the
                                subject of preceeding lines. To suggest the less specific but more
                                pervasive nature of Darwin’s
                                "influence" on Blake, we must look at the movement
                                of these eighty-some lines as a whole, for their real (and Blakean)
                                burden is a vision of interpenetrating, interacting correspondences.

                                little orbs hanging in air suggest stars and, indeed, the following
                                four lines make the comparison explicit: <q> "So, late

                                like those in Blake’s first illustration to <hi rend="i">Il Penseroso.</hi> The star-seed-orbs as "husk, or

                                analogy to some stellar, etherial nutrient. The comparison of seeds
                                to stars leads to a digression: <q> Flowers of the sky! ye too to

                                Herschel’s conclusion "that the nebulae or
                                constellations of fixed stars are approaching each other, and must
                                finally coalesce in one mass." The
                                "Flame" of Nature’s wings reappears as
                                the lines following return to the discussion of seeds: <q>
                                    "Lo! on each SEED within its slender rind,<lb/>
                                    Life’s golden threads in endless circles wind;<lb/>

                                    design."<lb/> (IV.381-88) </q> The "living
                                flame" is vegetation, an image frequent enough in
                                Blake’s illustrations. More than that, it reflects
                                organic energy, the vital power that haunts Darwin—it is
                                but a shift of focus to see this power as spiritual or mental
                                flames. The image of "Life’s golden threads . .
                                . Maze within maze" picks up an earlier image of the
                                body’s circulatory system, which
                                "O’er . . . tissued membrane spreads / In living
                                net-work all its branching threads; / Maze within maze;"
                                just as, in turn, "So shoot the Spiderbroods at breezy dawn
                                / Their glittering net-work o’er the autumnal
                                lawn" (<hi rend="i">EV</hi> III.531-33, 555-56). The
                                discussion of seeds culminates in a picture of Earth, "the
                                mighty ball": <q> And the GREAT SEED evolves, disclosing
                                    ALL:<lb/> LIFE <hi rend="i">buds</hi> or <hi rend="i">breathes</hi> from Indus to the Poles,<lb/> And the vast

                                form" (<hi rend="i">BU</hi> 18.1, 7). These sorts of
                                associations help to gloss some of the multi-dimensions of creation
                                in <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi>: <q> . . . A Web dark &amp; cold,

                                "wings of flame" cannot break the net of its own
                                laws. Dampened by the melancholy of natural abstraction, these
                                flames of nature or natural inspiration are merely "another
                                and the same," or, as Blake saw the process, "the
                                Ashes of Mystery" animating again, "as of old so
                                now anew began / Babylon again in Infancy Calld Natural
                                Religion" (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> VIII, 111.22-24). <note id="n116"><hi rend="s">24</hi> Darwin stated at the outset of

                                    37), suggests that they are not entirely unrelated to
                                    Blake’s "mighty ones"—or

              <p>Darwin’s discussion of seeds now moves to the conclusion
                                which interested D. C. Leonard: <q> While in bright veins the

                                Leonard’s analogy to the first four lines of
                                "the Monster’s" creation (<hi rend="i">BU</hi> 10.19-23)<ref target="n118" type="note">26</ref> seems
                                too ground-less to bear repeating; nonetheless, every reader will
                                probably sense something Blake-like at work. Here again, what seem
                                to reverberate are words and minute images, rather than larger
                                patterns or trains of images (Blake metonymizes rather than
                                metaphorizes Darwin). Through the use of
                                "cobweb-threads" and "tissue,"
                                Darwin’s image of the brain recalls the seed and its
                                "lucid webs" and the body’s
                                "tissued membrane" with its "living
                                net-work" similar to that made by the Spider. So <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi>’s development of
                                Urizen’s "spiders web," the
                                "Female in embrio," is not altogether without
                                precedent: <q> 8. So twisted the cords, &amp; so knotted<lb/>
                                    The meshes: twisted like to the human brain<lb/> 9. And all

                                    <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> says, "is the Seat / Of Satan
                                in its Webs" (20.37-38). Darwin’s description of
                                "the glistening spine descends" is for Leonard a
                                picture of Urizen <q> In a horrible dreamful slumber;<lb/> Like the
                                    linked infernal chain;<lb/> A vast Spine writh’d in
                                    torment<lb/> (10.35-37) </q> This association serves to remind
                                us that Blake’s vision has a far greater (and more
                                compressed) complexity than Darwin’s: Urizen’s
                                "geophysical" chain of gravity is doubled by a
                                "biogenetic" spine; both are, inferentially,
                                serpentine or worm-like, and both the result of "horrible
                                dreamful slumber"—as was, perhaps,
                                Darwin’s entire vision for Blake.<ref target="n119" type="note">27</ref> Drawing on Albert S. Roe’s

              <p>Leonard also reminds us of the central importance and wide
                                applicability of Darwin’s proposal "that all
                                warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which THE
                                FIRST GREAT CAUSE endued with animality" (<hi rend="i">Z</hi> 39.4, p. 505), relating it to the
                                "fibrous" branching of the globe of life blood,
                                whose "fibres or filaments" Leonard sees as
                                "the life roots of creation." More interesting,
                                though equally lacking in credible support, is Leonard’s
                                intuitive analogy linking Orc in his initial, simple, form of a worm
                                to Darwin’s primordial filament. <q> . . . Enitharmon,
                                    sick,<lb/> Felt a Worm within her womb.<lb/><lb/> 4. Yet

                                    it grew to a serpent<lb/> (<hi rend="i">BU</hi> 19.19-26) </q>
                                This may be seen, in part, as a description of the penis in the
                                vagina and also, evidently, as the male seed (already known to
                                consist of worm-like forms<ref target="n121" type="note">29</ref>).
                                Leonard and also Carmen S. Kreiter<ref target="n122" type="note">30</ref> develop the idea that the worm’s change to
                                "Many forms of fish, bird &amp; beast" which
                                "Brought forth an Infant form" suggests embryonic
                                "evolutionary" recapitulation. Of equal interest
                                is the development of "the worm" into
                                Blake’s general silk-worm imagery, and the obliquely
                                related idea of some form of "line" at the source
                                of creation. This idea might be summarized as follows: <q> (chain =

              <p>For Darwin, the idea of the first filament/fibre/line seems to have
                                accompanied some sort of imaginative revelation, since while lines
                                pass unremarked in <hi rend="i">The Botanic Garden</hi>, after the
                                discussions of fibres in <hi rend="i">Zoonomia</hi> they come to
                                prominence in <hi rend="i">The Temple of Nature.</hi> A reference to
                                spiders in the earlier work evokes a tag from Pope while hinting, as
                                mentioned above, at an analogy between the spider’s

                                "Inventress of the Woof, fair LINA"
                                (II.67)—cotton’s appropriate Latin
                                name—in whose loom is worked "the
                                fibre-line" (II.78; lines become linen). Among the primal
                                microscopic forms of life are "Self-moving lines"
                                    (<hi rend="i">TN</hi> I.286), while in seeds, "The

                                living fibre shoots" and "new embryon fibrils . .
                                . form the living line" (<hi rend="i">EV</hi> II.63, 65,
                                79-80). Out of such reproductive techniques "heaven born

                                Darwin’s note on "Imagination’s
                                power" over reproduction says, "It is not to be
                                understood, that the first living fibres, are produced by
                                imagination, with any similarity of form to the future animal, but
                                with appetencies or propensities, which shall produce . . .

                                (II.118n.). For Blake, imagination is the father of all
                                reproduction, the creator (not reproducer) of the line which (as for
                                Darwin) is only "tinctured" in the loom/womb
                                textile machinery of the mother: <q> And first he drew a line upon

                                    "It must be admitted that [Darwin] narrowed down the

              <p><hi rend="i">The Temple of Nature</hi> also presents the livingline
                                or fibre as the basic unit of animation because of its power of
                                contraction. A note to the lengthy passage quoted above says that
                                "The power of contraction, which exists in organized bodies
                                and distinguishes life from inanimation, appears to consist of an
                                ethereal fluid which resides in the brain and nerves of living
                                bodies, and is expended in the act of shortening their
                                fibres" (I.245n.). A power of expansion, which Darwin
                                nowhere posits (expansion being the result of another contraction),
                                was already part of Blake’s conception of Eternity:
                                "The will of the Immortal expanded / Or contracted his all
                                flexible senses" (<hi rend="i">BU</hi> 3.37-38). Eternity,
                                evidently, is non-linear: the pure state, perhaps, of the
                                "etherial fluid" or "spirit of
                                animation" (<hi rend="i">Z</hi>, p. 30).<ref target="n126" type="note">34</ref> Given the heritage of Locke and Newton (in

                                Darwin), our textured universe of lines and fibres testifies to the
                                impossibility of Edenic perception; for Darwin, indeed,
                                "The word <hi rend="i">idea</hi> . . . is defined as a

                                become chains, "links of the chain of fibrous

                                sound" (<hi rend="i">TN</hi> III.398, IV.266, 268). Darwin
                                himself realizes one now much-discussed consequence of this
                                imprisonment: "the acquirement of different languages in
                                their infancy may affect the modes of thinking and reasoning of
                                whole nations, or of different classes of society; as the words of
                                them do not accurately suggest the same ideas, or parts of ideal
                                trains; a circumstance which has not been sufficiently
                                analysed" (<hi rend="i">TN</hi> IV.398n.). <note id="n126"><hi rend="s">34</hi> Darwin continues, "The
                                    circumstances attending the exertion of the power of ATTRACTION
                                    constitute the laws of motion of inanimate
                                    matter"—Eternity precedes the constitution
                                    of these laws ("Earth was not: nor globes of
                                    attraction").</note></p>
              <p>The silk-worm occupies an interesting position in this universe of
                                lines: a kind of "living line," it cocoons itself
                                with self-produced line, only to burst its "well-woven
                                house of silk" (<hi rend="i">TN</hi> Add. N. IX) after
                                transformation. Darwin’s images also serve to remind us
                                that "worm" was a standard term for
                                "silk-worm," a convention which has ramifications
                                for Blake’s references: <q> The Silk-Worm broods in
                                    countless tribes above<lb/> Crop the green treasure,
                                    uninform’d of love;<lb/> Erewhile the changeful worm

                                    II.295-304) </q> The rationale for this is "sexual
                                reproduction only which seems to have been the
                                chef-d’oeuvre, or capital work of nature;<ref target="n127" type="note">35</ref> as appears by the wonderful
                                transformation of leaf-eating caterpillars into honey-eating moths
                                and butterflyes, apparently for the sole purpose of the formation of
                                sexual organs, as in the silk-worm, which takes no food after its
                                transformation, but propagates its species and dies" (<hi rend="i">TN</hi> Add. N. VIII). The silk-worm’s
                                change raises in particular the question of instinct: <q> Conscious

                                here, but Darwin’s discussion of the Portland Vase in <hi rend="i">The Economy of Vegetation</hi> pointed the way to an
                                analogy that might have interested Blake. Instinct, the
                                "dumb language," and the "spirit of
                                imagination" exist outside the immediate organization of
                                lines to effect the transformation of line into expanded plenum:
                                each parted linear link of word is also like a worm, waiting for its
                                wings. <note id="n127"><hi rend="s">35</hi> This same argument in

                </title>
              </head>
              <p>The famous Barberini Vase, which had been brought to England eighteen
                                months previously, was acquired by the Duke of Portland in June
                                1786. A few days later it was loaned to Josiah Wedgwood, who had
                                long desired to create some copies of it. Wedgwood was another close
                                friend of Darwin’s: their families were to be linked by
                                marriage, and Wedgwood’s remarkable industrial pottery,
                                "Etruria," was so named by Darwin because he
                                thought that Wedgwood had rediscovered a kind of ceramic painting
                                previously known only to the ancient Etruscans. Darwin no doubt
                                studied the original and in 1790 was sent the first copy for
                                approval. Against this background it is no surprise to see a slight
                                reference to the vase in <hi rend="i">The Economy of
                                Vegetation</hi>— <q> Or bid Mortality rejoice and
                                    mourn<lb/> O’er the fine forms in

                                —occasion several different views of the vase (illus.
                                1-4) and a lengthy "Additional Note" whose
                                explanation of the scenes on the vase "is still regarded as
                                the best."<ref target="n128" type="note">36</ref> The views
                                were evidently copied and engraved by Blake, who—judging
                                from Johnson’s letter to Darwin of 23 July
                                1791—was for a time entrusted with the vase itself.<ref target="n129" type="note">37</ref> Darwin’s remarks
                                would in any event have interested any student of Bryant and the
                                other mythologists, for, according to Darwin, the vase
                                "represents what in antient times engaged the attention of
                                philosophers, poets, and heros, I mean a part of the Eleusinian
                                mysteries" (Add. N. XXII). Darwin’s deep
                                interest in these matters emerges more strongly in the
                                "Preface" to <hi rend="i">The Temple of
                                    Nature</hi> where he writes that "in the mysteries the
                                philosophy of the works of Nature . . . are believed to have been
                                taught by allegoric scenery . . . which gave rise to the machinery
                                of this poem." The scenes on the vase he describes as
                                "the first part of this scenery," representing
                                "Death, and the destruction of all things." In <hi rend="i">The Economy of Vegetation</hi>, Darwin sees the central
                                figure, a female in a dying attitude (represented by the inverted
                                torch in her hand, "an antient emblem of extinguished
                                life"), as "an hieroglyphic of the Eleusinian
                                emblem of MORTAL LIFE, that is, the lethu, or death, mentioned by
                                Virgil amongst the terrible things exhibited at the beginning of the
                                mysteries." Another figure, "The MANES or GHOST
                                appears lingering and fearful, and wishes to drag after him a part
                                of his mortal garment, which however adheres to the side of the
                                portal through which he has passed." Such images <figure><head>1 The Portland Vase.</head><figDesc>Courtesy of Robert Essick.</figDesc></figure><pb id="p15-43" n="43"/><figure><head>2 The First Compartment.</head><figDesc>Courtesy of Robert Essick.</figDesc></figure><figure><head>3 The Second Compartment.</head><figDesc>Courtesy of Robert Essick.</figDesc></figure><figure><head>4 The Handles and Bottom of the Vase.</head><figDesc>Courtesy of Robert Essick.</figDesc></figure> perhaps helped to point Blake toward his later use of
                                body-as-garment. And while there are many sources, conscious and
                                not, for Blake’s varied and multivalent serpent images,
                                the following passage must have occasioned some interest:
                                "A little lower down in the group the manes or ghost is
                                received by a beautiful female, a symbol of IMMORTAL LIFE. This is
                                evinced by her fondling between her knees a large and playful
                                serpent, which from its annually renewing its external skin has from
                                great antiquity . . . been esteemed an emblem of renovated
                                youth." This may suggest another interpretation for the
                                mysterious design in <hi rend="i">America</hi>, pl. 14, where a
                                would-be scholar prays to a seated woman with a fondled serpent
                                between her spread knees. The "death-preaching
                                sibyl" seen by David Erdman is an academic
                                projection—the serpent at the bottom of the plate
                                ejaculates those same flames from which the student, as Orc or
                                "renovated youth" in the design of pl. 10, could
                                emerge. So also the serpent of pl. 11 ridden by children and reined
                                by a young girl could offer extremely positive associations: in the
                                text of pl. 15, the female spirits "glowing with the lusts
                                of youth . . . feel the nerves of youth renew. and desires of
                                ancient times." As the same design of the ridden serpent
                                appears at the end of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi>, these same
                                associations may affect the interpretation and dating of that final
                                plate, already generally considered as a later addition to the poem.

              <p>But the most interesting explanation comes towards the close of the
                                note; it offers information available elsewhere, but in succinct and
                                memorable form summarizes an emblem essential for considering, <hi rend="i">inter alia</hi>, the title page of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>: <q> The Psyche of the AEgyptians was one of
                                    their most favorite emblems, and represented the soul, or a
                                    future life; it was originally no other than the aurelia, or
                                    butterfly, but in after times was represented by a lovely female
                                    child with the beautiful wings of that insect. The aurelia,
                                    after its first stage as an eruca or caterpillar, lies for a
                                    season in a manner dead, and is inclosed in a sort of coffin, in
                                    this state of darkness it remains all the winter, but at the
                                    return of spring it bursts its bonds and comes out with a new
                                    life, and in the most beautiful attire. The AEgyptians thought
                                    this a very proper picture of the soul of man, and of the
                                    immortality to which it aspired. But as this was all owing to
                                    divine Love, of which EROS was an emblem, we find this person
                                    frequently introduced as a concomitant of the soul in general of
                                    Psyche. (Bryant’s Mythol. Vol. II. p. 386). </q> This
                                rich description could serve to gloss many of Blake’s
                                images which point to the cocoon or chrysalis stage of lepidoptral
                                metamorphosis: the couch of death, covering veil, golden bed.<ref target="n130" type="note">38</ref> "In Eden [Beulah,

                                Beulah—reminding us that in the Blakean <hi rend="i">aufhebung</hi> of the image Darwin’s aurelia becomes
                                Blake’s human larva. Time itself is a cocoon: <pb id="p15-44" n="44"/> "every Moment has a Couch of gold
                                for soft repose" (<hi rend="i">M</hi> 28.45ff). The
                                sleeping (time=sleeping) "for a season in a manner
                                dead" is only prologue to the main event which interested
                                Blake, pupation or "bursting": "Graves .
                                . . bursting with their births of immortality" (<hi rend="i">VLJ</hi>, E 543). Such references assume a formulaic
                                dimension, emphasizing—curiously—the
                                "bottom" of the grave/couch/cocoon, as when
                                multitudes of warlike sons "Burst the bottoms of the Graves
                                &amp; Funeral Arks of Beulah" (<hi rend="i">J</hi>
                                89.6, et al.). This bursting consistently represents a kind of
                                deevolution or birth (as <hi rend="i">descent</hi>, perhaps) into
                                cruel "male forms without female counterparts or
                                Emanations" (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> VIIa 85.19). The dynamic
                                is perhaps similar to that of "The Crystal
                                Cabinet"—the bursting of which suggests that the
                                cabinet is in part a chrysalis—where the male gets
                                wrapped up in Beulah-love, but by intellectually striving to seize
                                its inmost form breaks the intended pattern of his development and
                                falls back to the weeping babe stage. For all Blake’s
                                emphasis on mental fight and individual exertion, there is a
                                contrasting faith in a kind of spiritual "genetic
                                programming," a saving "inmost
                                form"—"this was all owing to divine
                                Love," to use Darwin’s words. But Blake reverses
                                Darwin’s conception of emblem and actuality. <note id="n130"><hi rend="s">38</hi> "Gold" enters

                                    or holy person. It is now become a symbolic language of
                                    painting, and it is much to be wished that this kind of
                                    hieroglyphic character was more frequent in that art; as it is
                                    much wanted to render historic pictures both more intelligible,
                                    and more sublime; and why should not painting as well as poetry
                                    express itself in a metaphor, or in indistinct allegory? A truly
                                    great modern painter lately endeavored to enlarge the sphere of
                                    pictorial language, by putting a demon behind the pillow of a
                                    wicked man on his death bed. Which unfortunately the cold
                                    criticism of the present day has depreciated; and thus barred
                                    perhaps the only road to further improvement in this

                                experiments in expression would probably have elicited
                                Blake’s interest:<ref target="n132" type="note">40</ref>
                                the serpents of <hi rend="i">America</hi>, for example, seem to
                                offer a "kind of hieroglyphic character" in their
                                part of that work’s metaphor or "indistinct
                                allegory." <note id="n132"><hi rend="s">40</hi> There is,
                                    indeed, some special pleading in Darwin’s argument;
                                    for as Logan notes, no one can write a poem on scientific
                                    processes and be pictorial without being abstract except through
                                    allegory, personification, and simile: "Everything must
                                    be interpreted through symbols, if fantastic none the less
                                    concrete. If no concrete symbol can be found, then the
                                    abstraction must be addressed directly, hailed by name and
                                    importuned, and thus dragged bodily before the mind of the
                                    reader" (pp. 138-39). For example, "an illicit
                                    love affair is used as an allegory for the chemical reaction of
                                    nitric acid with oxygen to produce what is probably a nitrate
                                    salt. During the course of this reaction, a reddish vapor is
                                    given off and heat escapes; and Darwin likens this result to
                                    Mars’ seduction of Venus and to Vulcan’s
                                    ensuing anger, which ties them together with a net, that, the
                                    chemical bond" (Hassler, p. 56). For Blake, such
                                    limited symbols must ultimately be subsumed to apparent
                                    confusions of text—that is, the whole text itself is
                                    the only adequate "symbol."</note></p>
              <p>Striking also is Darwin’s spectre-like conception of <q>

                                vital energy—here he is not far from a foreshadowing of
                                natural selection. He notes that the horns of stags "have
                                therefore been formed for the purpose of combatting other stags for
                                the exclusive possession of the females, who are observed, like the
                                ladies in the times of chivalry, to attend the car of the
                                victor" (<hi rend="i">TN</hi> II.321n.). So Darwin
                                concludes this theme with a reference to the "Knight on
                                Knight, recorded in romance" who looked to the admiring
                                eyes of the female bands, "Bow’d to the Beauty,
                                and receiv’d her smiles" (<hi rend="i">TN</hi>
                                II.333). Faint reward indeed, but perhaps remembered by Blake in the
                                dark conception of Vala-centered strife through <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Chapter 3: <q> This is no warbling brook, nor
                                    shadow of a mirtle tree:<lb/> But blood and wounds and dismal
                                    cries, and shadows of the oaks:<lb/> And hearts laid open to the

                                    hear thy sighs in trumpets shrill when morn shall blood
                                    renew.<lb/> (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 65.50-55) </q> Given
                                "the importance of the sexual love which Darwin believes to
                                be the most highly developed kind of love" (Hassler, p.
                                84), it is not surprising that Darwin turns from sexual strife to
                                the domestic "triumph of despotic LOVE"; even
                                "the enamour’d Flowers": <q> Breath

                                </q> But for Blake such deification is woven to dreams, and
                                "Sexes must vanish &amp; cease / To be, when Albion
                                arises from his dread repose" (<hi rend="i">J</hi>
                                92.13-14). This may serve as Blake’s final response to
                                what must have been the most compelling aspect of
                                Darwin’s vision<ref target="n134" type="note">42</ref>—a positive delight in sexual organization that

              <p>Darwin’s vision of the sexual universe reaches heights of

                                this idea is evident in the catalogue of poetic paraphrases he finds
                                for women’s breasts: "velvet orbs,"
                                "milky fount," "the Paphian

                                </q> Concerning "wavy lawns," Darwin offers a long
                                and detailed footnote (taken verbatim from <hi rend="i">Zoonomia</hi> XIV.6) to support his contention that when we see
                                any object of vision which bears any similitude to the form of the
                                female bosom, "if the object be not too large, we
                                experience an attraction to embrace it with our arms, and to salute
                                it with our lips, as we did in our early infancy the bosom of our
                                mother." This may suggest an additional link between
                                    "beauty"<ref target="n136" type="note">44</ref> and "Beulah"—as in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> 30.10-11, "Beulah to its
                                Inhabitants appears within each district / As the beloved infant in
                                his mothers bosom round incircled." <note id="n136"><hi rend="s">44</hi> In connection with Darwin’s
                                    "breast-esthetic," Logan observes:
                                    "Here we have the whole foundation of
                                    Darwin’s theory of poetry and art. Beauty is frankly
                                    sensuous; it arises from those things, belonging to nature which
                                    have given us pleasure through our different senses. . . . It is
                                    a much cleverer, and certainly more modern, explanation of the
                                    delight that we receive from curving lines than
                                    Hogarth’s ‘wanton chase’
                                    theory" (p. 62).</note></p>
              <p>The third edition of <hi rend="i">The Economy of Vegetation</hi>
                                (1795) included a new illustration, engraved by Blake, of
                                "The Tornado" (illus. 5). A Note, as usual,
                                contains the meat of the discussion; this one follows a note on the
                                "Maelstrom" which labels that phenomenon
                                "an extensive vortex, or eddy," testifying to the
                                general linguistic equivalence between
                                vortex-eddy-whirlpool-(tornado) which would have informed
                                Blake’s reading. Darwin tells us that two major winds
                                meeting in contrary directions cannot be supposed to balance each
                                other, and as a result "a rotatory motion will be produced
                                as they ascend like water falling through a hole [sic], and an
                                horizontal or spiral eddy is the consequence; these eddies are more
                                or less rapid, and are called Tornadoes in their most violent
                                state" (<hi rend="i">EV</hi> Add. N. XXXIII). This violent
                                eddy "has not only its progressive velocity, but its
                                circular one also, <pb id="p15-46" n="46"/> which thus lifts up or
                                overturns every thing within its spiral whirl." This offers
                                a potentially significant lesson in Blakean psycho-physics:
                                expressed more simply, "The surface of contact between two
                                currents curls over to form a vortex"<ref target="n137" type="note">45</ref>—perhaps even the surface of
                                contact between "currents of creation," or even,
                                contrary ideas. Blake’s engraving is striking in
                                comparison with others done about this time—as a Tornado,
                                or spiral eddy, the various coiled serpents represent the circular
                                velocity of the vortex. The left-hand figure in plate 6 of <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> suggests, in particular, the
                                inverse, inverted image of "The Toronado." <note id="n137"><hi rend="s">45</hi> Theodor Schwenk, <hi rend="i">Sensitive Chaos: The Creation of Flowing Forms in Water and

              <p>But there are other pleasures to reading Darwin aside from reading-in
                                Blake. One can only feel great admiration for the man, and for the
                                growing power of experimental science, after pondering
                                Darwin’s note that the larynx is "something like
                                the trumpet stop of an organ, as may be observed by blowing through
                                the wind-pipe of a dead goose" (<hi rend="i">TN</hi> Add.
                                N. XV). And there is a certain charm in Darwin’s style,
                                when taken in small doses: <q> [the NEREID’s] playful
                                    Sea-horse woos her soft commands,<lb/> Turns his quick ears, his
                                    webbed claws expands,<lb/> His watery way with waving volutes
                                    wins,<lb/> Or listening librates on unmoving fins.<lb/> (<hi rend="i">EV</hi> III.227-80) </q> And there are haunting
                                lapses—as in the verses on the "electric
                                kiss" (<hi rend="i">EV</hi> I. 349-56), or the story of the
                                plague-diseased Aegle and her lover Thyrsis, who "clasps
                                the bright Infection in his arms" (<hi rend="i">EV</hi> IV.
                                106). And there is still the pleasure of
                                "archeological" discovery; who
                                knows?—someone may yet vindicate Richard
                                Edgeworth’s belief that "in future times some
                                critic will arise who shall re-discover <hi rend="i">The Botanic
                                    Garden</hi> and build his fame upon this discovery. . . . It
                                will shine out again to the admiration of posterity" (cited
                                in Logan, p. 94). But anyone, surely, can safely take the pleasure
                                of reading Darwin once.</p>
              <p>Darwin’s poetical works are now available in facsimile as
                                part of the Garland "Romantic Context" series,
                                with a serviceable introduction by Donald H. Rieman.<ref target="n138" type="note">46</ref> Unfortunately, these are not
                                as successful as the facsimile editions published by the Scholar
                                Press in 1973—most importantly with regard to the
                                illustrations, which in the Garland edition look like bad xeroxes,
                                with the names of artist and engraver sometimes cropped off. The
                                Garland series chooses, curiously, to reproduce the second edition
                                of <hi rend="i">The Loves of the Plants.</hi> This opens the way to
                                some interesting comparisons<ref target="n139" type="note">47</ref>
                                for the student having access to both reprints or to other later
                                editions, but offers a slightly less successful text for the
                                single-copy reader. The Garland <hi rend="i">Temple of Nature</hi>
                                also includes <hi rend="i">The Golden Age</hi>, a parodic epistle in
                                verse issued under Darwin’s name; the fact that one
                                university bibliographer once accepted the attribution hardly
                                justifies its inclusion, which only serves to make one the more
                                regret the exclusion of the truly damaging parody, "The
                                Loves of the Triangles." Still, every undergraduate library
                                should now include Darwin, and for those that do not, the Garland
                                edition would be the easiest solution. <note id="n138"><hi rend="s">46</hi> Erasmus Darwin, <hi rend="i">The Botanic

            <p>Students who learn from their mentors only that Blake left Felpham in a
                            snit, that thereupon he "immortalized [Hayley] as a fool not to
                            be endured," and so conclude, "no one much cares what
                            Hayley said," are unlikely to be affected by, much less
                            interested in, historical judgments of Blake’s
                            patron—are indeed apt to be impatient with them and
                            unappreciative of an effort, such as Donald Reiman’s, to
                            situate Hayley in a "Romantic Context." They may even
                            be suspicious, if not wholly contemptuous, of an enterprise that would
                            publish four volumes of Hayley’s verse under the caption,
                                "<hi rend="i">Significant</hi> Minor Poetry" (my
                            italics). This poetry is not by current standards, much less by the
                            standards of Hayley’s more astute contemporaries, good. It
                            is, in the most generous terms, an achievement of the left hand, yet
                            offers its own rewards, even to the most recalcitrant Blakeans,
                            presuming they are able to cast off prejudice long enough to ask the
                            right questions. Why Blake left Felpham we know. Why he went to Felpham
                            in the first place and what he and Hayley talked about, off and on for
                            three years, are matters of interest that these four volumes might fuel.
                            They do not answer such questions, to be sure, but set forth clues for
                            answering them; they might even inspire a more enterprising student to
                            heed the Hayleyan plea—"extend that biographic
                            page!"—and, in the process, to adjudicate between
                            widely discrepant assessments of Hayley’s place in literary
                            history and of the role he might have played in Blake’s life
                            and art, even in the formation of an aesthetic that underlies it.</p>
            <pb id="p15-49" n="49"/>
            <p>The simple allegorizing of Hayle into Hayley, invented in our century and
                            popularized by Blake’s editors, is analogous to the
                            allegorizing of Prometheus against which Hayley himself registered a
                            protest in <hi rend="i">An Essay on Sculpture</hi>; it would seem,
                            moreover, to run counter to Blake’s own preference for a
                            visionary over an allegorical mode of poetry and to become increasingly
                            more dubious as one weighs the judgments of history against those
                            imposed upon Hayley by the Blake cult. Against its generally hostile
                            evaluations are the more temperate estimates of literary historians and
                            critical theorists (such as H. T. Swedenberg and Northrop Frye) and of
                            reviewers and poets roughly contemporary with Hayley, yet not nearly so
                            rough in their appraisal of him (such as Southey, Coleridge, and even
                            Byron). There are finally the highly laudatory remarks about Hayley that
                            come from Miltonists of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
                            centuries: the editor of the <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> printed by
                            C. Whittingham in 1799 draws upon Hayley for his epigraph and admits he
                            is chiefly indebted to Hayley; and Charles Dunster, in his 1800 edition
                            of <hi rend="i">Paradise Regained</hi>, portrays Hayley as the
                            age’s best knower of Milton. Perhaps the truth about Hayley,
                            especially about Blake’s regard and disregard of him, is too
                            complicated to be fairly represented by a single spokesman and thus is
                            to be approached through a variety of perspectives that in their very
                            contrariness lead one closer to that truth. As Samuel Palmer might say
                            in this instance: "Truth . . . seems . . . to stand at a fixed
                            centre between its two antagonists, Fact and Phantasm."</p>
            <p>Reiman’s Introduction, not tailored to individual volumes but
                            expediently (for the publisher) reprinted four times, formulates the
                            paradox of Hayley’s once being among "the most
                            respected poets, as well as the most popular . . . in England"
                            (p. v) and now being scarcely remembered except by Blakeans, and then
                            usually scornfully. The praise bestowed upon this poet by the popular
                            culture, which contributed to his being offered the Laureateship in
                            1790, was an anathema to most of the major Romantic poets who even if
                            they judged Hayley unworthy of that honor (so Hayley also judged
                            himself!) could accept, albeit grudgingly, Southey’s estimate
                            of him quoted in the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>:
                            "everything about that man is good except his poetry."
                            Like his fellow Romantics, Blake probably judged Hayley to be a
                            rhymester not a poet, but, again like them, may have found something,
                            both in his prose writings and in conversation, to redeem Hayley. Even
                            if Blake was as jealous in his independence, as petty in his
                            relationships, and as stingy in his praise, as some critics make him out
                            to be, he might have concurred in the following sentiment so long, that
                            is, that he did not know its author was Leigh Hunt: "two things
                            must be remembered to his honour, . . . he has been the quickest of our
                            late writers to point out the great superiority of the Italian school
                            over the French; and . . . has been among the first . . . in hailing the
                            dawn of our native poetry." To be remembered too, though not
                            always to his honor, is Hayley’s relationship with Blake, a
                            three-year encounter, which, having for so long been caricatured, needs
                            now to be humanized and then re-viewed along the lines that Reiman
                            proposes: "His work on plates for a number of
                            Hayley’s titles suggests that a study [of them] . . . in the
                            light of Blake’s ideas is likely to point to the origin of
                            details (perhaps parodying Hayley’s ideas) in
                            Blake’s own writings after 1803" (pp. xii-xiii). In
                            this way the blankness of the historical record regarding the extent of
                            their agreements and disagreements might be filled in with plausible
                            speculation that remains faithful to the principles of both men.</p>
            <p>What did Blake and Hayley talk about? Why might Blake have felt
                            intellectually in his debt despite deep, even irreconcilable,
                            differences? Hayley’s poetry, along with the accompanying
                            notes, provides some ground for conjecture. They talked about Milton
                            certainly (in <hi rend="i">An Essay on Sculpture</hi>, 1800, Hayley
                            calls him "The hallow’d Homer of the Christian
                            world" [II. 170]); and they probably talked about the whole
                            epic tradition of which Milton was England’s mighty exemplar,
                            of Sidney and Spenser perhaps, and of Dante and Tasso. Hayley thought
                            Dante’s poetry, especially the Ugolino episode, might provide
                            a new subject matter for painters and, in <hi rend="i">An Essay on Epic
                                Poetry</hi>, 1782, offered the first sustained English translation
                            for the <hi rend="i">Commedia</hi>—a rendering in <hi rend="i">terza rima</hi> of the first three cantos of the Inferno.
                            As early as <hi rend="i">A Poetical Epistle to an Eminent Painter</hi>,
                            1778, addressed to George Romney, Hayley urged, "Let
                            Milton’s self" lead the artist to portray
                            "the scenes that blaze in his immortal song," singling
                            out his Michael and especially his Satan who is "more sublimely
                            true" than that of Raphael, Guido, and West—a Satan
                            who has not yet lost his original brightness as he awakens his legions
                            or, still earlier, as he is "falling from the Realms of Bliss,
                            / Hurl’d in the Combustion to the deep Abyss" (II.
                            451-74, Notes, p. 76). Allusions to Milton elsewhere in
                            Hayley’s poetry reveal a mind captivated by the episode of
                            Ithuriel’s spear. Romney picked up such hints, and Blake may
                            have responded to them as well. In <hi rend="i">An Essay on
                                Sculpture</hi> Hayley returns to Milton, this time to celebrate him
                            with Tasso as one who "Imbib’d the fervour of
                            sublime design" (I. 133); with Michelangelo as one who,
                            achieving a perfection that no precepts teach, "close[d] / A
                            life of labour in divine repose, / In that calm vale of years"
                            (I. 157-60); and with Newton as an example of men in whom
                            "ceaseless toil" produced "pure
                            minds" and who "to glory climb’d"
                            (I.230-38). Here again Hayley urges sculptors "To quicken
                            marble with Miltonic fire" (II.194) and, later, praises the
                            industry and genius of Fuseli’s Milton Gallery. Here too he
                            will praise <hi rend="i">Paradise Regained</hi> for containing
                            "the sublimest censure of the national conduct of
                            Rome" (Notes, p. 306) and, in <hi rend="i">An Elegy on the
                                Death of Sir William Jones</hi>, 1795, the "local
                            exactitude" of Milton’s descriptions (Notes, p. 25).
                            But in <hi rend="i">An Essay on History</hi>, 1780, he had already
                            complained of the "Danger of dwelling on the distant and minute
                            parts of a subject really interesting," observing
                            Milton’s "Failure . . . in this particular"
                            (III, Argument). There are poems like <hi rend="i">The Eulogies of
                                Howard</hi> that through an epigraph, "to tell of deeds /
                            Above heroic," will establish a Miltonic context or that
                            through a subtitle, "A Vision," will invoke a
                            tradition of which, in comparison with Blake, Hayley has but a
                            diminished awareness.</p>
            <p>Subjects raised by Hayley’s poetry might also have provided
                            topics for conversation: Michelangelo and Raphael; John Howard, the
                            prison reformer; <pb id="p15-50" n="50"/> Newton, religionist and
                            scientist; Cowper, Romney, Reynolds, Flaxman, and Fuseli; William Jones,
                            Thomas Maurice, and their Asiatic researches; Bishop Lowth and his
                            lectures on the bardic poetry of the Hebrews. Individual phrases,
                            however puerile their contexts, might have captured Blake’s
                            attention—"mental eyes," "mental
                            vision," "optics of the mind," "a
                            mental mist," "unfetter’d forms,"
                            "art divine," "living forms,"
                            "vast design," "radiant
                            structure"—perhaps even an entire line like this one
                            from <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>: "I see thee riding in the sun,
                            / Upon the Eagle’s back" (III). Certain of
                            Hayley’s ideas, however inadequate their poetic embodiment,
                            might similarly have provided occasions for conversation: "the
                            removal of . . . galling fetters" from mankind; "Jesus
                            enthron’d in every human heart"; "boundless
                            vision . . . uncrampt by time and space"; "the bard,
                            to rhymes no more confin’d";
                            "Adam’s race redeem’d from woe . . .
                            [and] Paradise to man restored." Blake would have entered his
                            demurrals, of course; and Hayley may have been patronizing, or worse, in
                            receiving them. But if our renewed consideration of their relationship
                            were to suggest a more human and civilized dimension, a modulation of
                            rancor into guarded respect, we might sense that Blake came to feel with
                            Hayley that an appropriate tribute to such respect is to realize another
                            man’s ideas, even if realizing them means sometimes altering
                            so as to improve upon them.</p>
            <p>If Blake had read Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Felpham</hi>, 1814, he
                            might have cast himself into the role assigned to Cowper, that of a
                            Miltonic bard laboring to unfetter the human mind. Blake might even have
                            imagined himself accomplishing what Hayley says his son—had
                            he lived—would have accomplished: "Confederate
                            arts" joining "to see / Their English Michael Angelo
                            in thee" (p. 22). The extent to which Blake came to Felpham as
                            a surrogate son who disappointed, and was disappointed in, his father
                            needs exploring. With Hayley’s conception of the arts and of
                            artistic objectives as they are set forth in <hi rend="i">An Essay on
                                Sculpture</hi> Blake could not help but have agreed. He would have
                            joined Hayley in resisting those "mental tyrants" in
                            their effort "To limit England in the sphere of Art"
                            (II. 165-66); with Hayley he would also have belittled "foreign
                            Theorists, with System blind, / Prescrib [ing] false limits to the
                            British mind" as Hayley puts it in <hi rend="i">A Poetical
                                Epistle</hi> (II. 15-16). He would have agreed with Hayley that
                            through the arts a nation makes bold advances to ideal life, that the
                            arts, while they reveal the "destin’d
                            havoc" of the world, are also heralds of a purer day
                            (IV.578-86). He would probably have found Hayley’s
                            analogizing of the young artist to "A young Prometheus in a
                            vulture’s clasp" (VI.20) pointedly relevant, even
                            ironically apt, to his own situation of which the very man who hoped
                            that young artists would not be tyrannized by engravers and who, in <hi rend="i">A Poetical Epistle</hi>, allowed as how fashion
                            "fetters the creative hand" (I.53-56) now seemed so
                            remarkably insensitive. It remains one of the ironies of literary
                            history that Hayley who chastized others for confounding, depressing,
                            dampening the genius of young poets seems to have done just that, at
                            least for a time, with Blake.</p>
            <p>Hayley must have seemed a strangely divided personality to Blake, as he
                            did to other of the Romantic poets. Yet all of them, including Blake,
                            would be expected to see art, along with Hayley in <hi rend="i">An Essay
                                on Sculpture</hi>, as emerging, still emerging, from darkness and
                            "shin[ing] through Oppression’s storm" (IV,
                            22-23),—as being a projection of that history, at once epical
                            and tragical, which it would alter. The very alignment that Hayley, in
                                <hi rend="i">An Essay on History</hi>, perceives between history and
                            art, the former lending a dramatic center to the latter, must have fired
                            Blake’s interest in, impelled his scrutiny of both history
                            and art, the former not chronicled but mythologized however, and the
                            latter raised to the key of prophecy and vision. In the very act of
                            identifying Hayley with Hyle, some of Blake’s critics have
                            scandalized a relationship that begs to be psychologized; moreover, they
                            have Newtonized a vision whose ultimate goal is to save us from single
                            vision and Newton’s sleep. Blake’s poetry is not,
                            in the words of <hi rend="i">An Essay on Sculpture</hi>, "mere
                            allegory" (Notes, p. 188). If Donald Reiman’s Hayley
                            helps to redeem us from the simple equation, Hyle = Hayley, it will have
                            performed a valuable service for Blakeans; and in the very act of
                            setting Hayley within a Romantic context Reiman has brought us one step
                            nearer capturing the spirit of an age that is as much the age of Hayley
                            and Hunt as of Southey and Shelley, of Byron and Blake.</p>

            <p>This book is a collection of essays all but two of which were delivered
                            as lectures during the past decade or so. The essays are:
                            "England’s Prophet";
                            "‘Everthing that Lives is
                            Holy’"; "Blake’s
                            Christianity"; "Blake’s Last
                            Judgement"; "Taylor, Blake and the English Romantic
                            Movement"; "Blake, Wordsworth and Nature";
                            "Innocence and Experience"; and "Berkeley,
                            Blake and the New Age." The book is intended, says the Preface,
                            "not for the academic, but for the common reader and especially
                            for those in search of what Blake himself claims to have possessed,
                            spiritual knowledge, and all the essays are said to be "studies
                            of Blake’s thought as it has an immediate bearing on changes
                            taking place at the present time" (vii).</p>
            <p>Raine sees the new age that Blake called for in the Preface to <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> as the "change of premises"
                            going on in the last part of the nineteenth century and the first half
                            of the twentieth that will replace materialism and restore mind as the
                            first principle of the universe. She does not deal with these changes or
                            with the direct relevance of Blake’s thought to them except
                            very generally, almost incidentally. And, as readers of Miss
                            Raine’s <hi rend="i">Blake and Tradition</hi> would know,
                            Blake’s thought is conceived of less as ideas developed by
                            himself than as spiritual knowledge received and transformed from the
                            esoteric tradition of the west, especially from Plotinus and Plato
                            through their contemporary interpreter and translator, Thomas
                            Taylor.</p>
            <p>Blake’s originality is vigorously denied in this book:
                            "Blake was not an original thinker, and the arrows he loosed
                            with such force from his bow of burning gold, though tipped with his own
                            fire, were seldom of his own making" (p. 151). And "At
                            the risk of shocking those lovers of Blake who see in him a visionary of
                            absolute originality, I must say that with better knowledge of
                            Blake’s own deep studies it seems to me that his most
                            remarkable gift was that of imaginatively assimilating the ideas of his
                            chosen teachers" (p. 115). While on one I think during the past
                            three decades at least would claim for Blake "absolute
                            originality," taking away as much of it as these statements do
                            is to take away too much of the reason for being interested in him at
                            all.</p>
            <p>In addition to what is called here "the Platonic
                            tradition," among Blake’s immediate teachers are not
                            only Thomas Taylor but also Swedenborg and Berkeley—who again
                            share in the Platonic tradition as conceived here. Returning in the last
                            essay of the book to the theme of the New Age, Raine writes: <q> It was
                                Blake who proclaimed the new age; not on his own authority but upon
                                that of Emanuel Swedenborg . . . When in his <hi rend="i">Marriage
                                    of</hi><pb id="p15-52" n="52"/><hi rend="i">Heaven and Hell</hi> Blake announced ‘a new
                                heaven is begun’, the prophecy is
                                Swedenborg’s; and the new vision of the age
                                is—allowing for common sources within a
                                tradition—Berkeley’s philosophy. (p. 151) </q>
                            Though recognizing that such a sweeping statement may "well be
                            challenged" and may need definition and limits, the only limits
                            set by Raine consist of her saying that in the Platonic tradition
                            "it is not always possible to say which particular writer is
                            the source of some common idea" (p. 151). There is no
                            indication that a reader looking into <hi rend="i">The Marriage of
                                Heaven and Hell</hi> would there find Swedenborg very vigorously and
                            unambiguously attacked, though it is true that Blake did owe more to
                            Swedenborg than his treatment of him in <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>
                            would suggest. In the discussion that follows there are many suggestive
                            parallels between Berkeley and Blake drawn piecemeal from a variety of
                            works. But if, as was suggested, the new vision announced in <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> was based on Berkeley’s
                            philosophy, there are only four incidental references to <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> to show for it, and no mention of
                            Blake’s idea of the Contraries, one of the central themes of
                            the new vision.</p>
            <p>Thomas Taylor is mentioned throughout the essays, but the strongest
                            claims for his importance not only to Blake but to the Romantic movement
                            as a whole come in the fifth essay, where Raine asserts that, though no
                            "great flowering of the arts could ever have one cause, . . .
                            the most powerful source of inspiration of the Romantic Movement was a
                            revival of the Platonic philosophy" through the translations
                            and commentaries of Thomas Taylor. There is a good deal of useful
                            information here about Taylor and the extent to which he was known in
                            his time. But the view of Romanticism we get is limited to literary
                            Romanticism and that only in England. Romanticism was indeed a
                            "great flowering of the arts"—not only
                            literature—and of politics, etc., in numerous languages and
                            cultures, in which influences of the Platonic tradition or, much less,
                            Taylor do not always seem to appear.</p>
            <p>It seems to me very unfortunate that Raine feels she must deny
                            Blake’s originality as much as she does. Blake is certainly
                            not the completely culturally isolated phenomenon he was thought to be
                            by some many years ago, and he has some roots in the esoteric tradition
                            as well as many other places. But if he was not as original as once
                            thought—and probably no one ever was—he was
                            fiercely independent; and it is very difficult to imagine his being as
                            derivative as he is said here to be. It seems to me that
                            Blake’s sources may be more profitably studied if we
                            don’t deny the affective impression we all had on first
                            looking into him, of an enormously fresh and original poet and artist
                            with depths of meaning only to be guessed at, rather than a visionary
                            transmitter of ideas merely assimilated from Platonic
                            tradition—and from Swedenborg and Berkeley. In considering
                            his debt to the Platonic tradition and to Plato himself as made
                            available in his time by Thomas Taylor, there is the stubborn fact that
                            Blake in all his works has few kind words to say about Plato.</p>

            <p>Johann Heinrich Füssli has been repatriated. Posthumously the
                            Swiss painter who, under the name of Henry Fuseli, became Professor of
                            Painting and Keeper of the London Royal Academy is now accepted as one
                            of the major figures of eighteenth-century Continental art,<ref target="n140" type="note">1</ref> and many of his most celebrated
                            works have, during the past seventy years or so, found their way
                            "back" into Swiss, German, and Italian collections.
                            Also, much of the scholarly work on Fuseli has been published on the
                            Continent, and now two aspects of his work which are not readily
                            available to the museum public, his poetry and his drawings, seem on the
                            verge of gaining the recognition they deserve. <note id="n140"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Thus, the first modern monograph, Arnold
                                Federmann’s <hi rend="i">Johann Heinrich
                                    Füssli: Dichter und Maler 1741-1825</hi> (Zurich and
                                Leipzig: Orell Füssli, 1927) was published as vol. 1 of a
                                series entitled "Monographien zur Schweizer
                                Kunst;" similarly, the <hi rend="i">catalogue
                                    raisonné</hi> is vol. 1 of the
                                "Oeuvrekataloge Schweizer Künstler,"
                                published for the Swiss Institute for Art Research (Gert Schiff, <hi rend="i">Johann Heinrich Füssli 1741-1825</hi>, 2
                                vols. [Zurich: Berichthaus, and Munich: Prestel, 1973]). Recently
                                Herbert von Einem discussed Fuseli in his book on <hi rend="i">Deutsche Malerei des Klassizismus und der Romantik 1760 bis
                                    1840</hi> (Munich: C. H. Beck, 1978).—It was in Rome
                                and in England that Fuseli developed from a gifted amateur into a
                                professional artist. Still, there might be a kernel of truth in
                                Pevsner’s hint that Fuseli’s
                                "Swiss-ness" may explain the basic discrepancies
                                between his and Flaxman’s style (see <hi rend="i">The
                                    Englishness of English Art</hi>, London: Architectural Press,
                                1956, pp. 126f.). Thus, I do not mean to ridicule, in a precipitant
                                way, what has been termed the "national character"
                                in art. Together with all milieu and social theory of art this
                                complex of questions undoubtedly belongs to the realm of unsolved
                                problems in post-war art history. The painter’s own
                                feelings for Switzerland obviously remained unsettled, which is
                                hardly surprising with an emigrant. (Compare, e.g., the satirical
                                drawing Schiff no. 568 and the poem on "Schweizerlands
                                Künstler."). In any case, it appears to be an
                                irresponsible—though probably
                                unconscious—chauvinism when Fuseli’s art is
                                "claimed" for the annals of this or that nation as
                                long as we know so little about the complex interplay of personal
                                style, national character and the
                                "internationalism" (Rosenblum) of late
                                eighteenth-century art.</note></p>

            <p>As a poet Fuseli indeed has to be considered in the context of
                            German-language literature. The relation between painting and poetry in
                            his <hi rend="i">oeuvre</hi> differs considerably from that in
                            Blake’s, where the terminology of the "sister
                            arts" and a "composite art" seems more
                            legitimate. The <hi rend="i">Sämtliche Gedichte</hi> do not
                            follow the concept of <hi rend="i">ut pictura poesis</hi> at all; on the
                            contrary, with few exceptions they are quite abstract and non-visual,
                            written in the manner and under the marked influence of Friedrich
                            Gottlieb Klopstock.<ref target="n142" type="note">3</ref> Guthke points
                            out what the reader of Fuseli’s poetry feels from the
                            beginning: the author favored the classical ode; his stanzas are alcaic
                            or asclepiadeic; he makes use of hexameters or distichs—all
                            rather complex poetic devices employed with an extensive knoweldge of
                            antique traditions. These suit much of his subject matter, which is full
                            of learned allusions and sometimes close to an allegorical
                            hide-and-seek. <note id="n142"><hi rend="s">3</hi> See

            <p>Many of these verses are addressed to Fuseli’s friends in
                            Switzerland; then there are the odes on patience, "auf den
                            Portwein," and "an das Vaterland." Other
                            groups are devoted to the <hi rend="i">Nibelungen</hi> saga and Germanic
                            history, the anti-slavery campaign and the American War of Independence,
                            or the author’s theory of art. That Fuseli’s
                            finest achievement as a poet is one of his few love poems,
                            "Nannas Auge," has long been accepted. Though Fuseli
                            has been identified as one of the major exponents of the
                            Storm-and-Stress movement, Guthke justly emphasizes that his poetry is
                            far from being impeccable. Often <pb id="p15-54" n="54"/> there are
                            signs of rhetorical over-working, a fault that Fuseli recognized and
                            criticized himself.<ref target="n143" type="note">4</ref> Judging the
                            quality of his literary work, however, we ought to remember that what we
                            have of his later poetry is in most cases known from working drafts
                            only, and Mason’s earlier hypothesis, that many of the poems
                            might have reached a maturer state in the lost fair copies, still seems
                                valid.<ref target="n144" type="note">5</ref><note id="n143"><hi rend="s">4</hi> See Bircher &amp; Guthke 1973,

            <p>The majority of the forty-six poems, printed here in an often tentative
                            chronological sequence, were written early in Fuseli’s
                            career, and only two of them in English. If seen in the context of
                            contemporary German and English literature, all of them bear witness to
                            the stylistic conservatism of their author. The mature work of Goethe
                            and Schiller, of Hölderlin and Kleist, of the German and
                            British Romantics made no mark. The odes bear an especially strong
                            resemblance to Klopstock’s "Hermann und
                            Thusnelda"—which Fuseli deliberately remodelled in
                            about 1760—while the prose poem "Klagen" is
                            somewhat reminiscent of Young’s <hi rend="i">Night
                                Thoughts.</hi> Another group reflects Fuseli’s admiration
                            for his countryman Rousseau,<ref target="n145" type="note">6</ref> and
                            throughout he shows a critical awareness of the decaying feudal
                            structures of European society, as seen through his own republicanism.
                            The cult of artistic creativity that is apparent in "Die Gaben
                            Gottes," the attack on colonialism and slavery and his
                            "prophecy" of the American Revolution in
                            "Chincona" and "Colombo" are
                            close—but close in subject matter only—to
                            Blake’s works of the early 1790s. Though Fuseli’s
                            poetry clearly suggests that his friendship with the engraver grew out
                            of a number of political and artistic ideas that they shared, I cannot
                            see any direct <hi rend="i">poetic</hi> influence of the one on the
                            other of the two men. [Mis-]reading the <hi rend="i">Gedichte</hi> as
                            prose essays, however, we find Fuseli’s "Erste [und
                            Zweite] Ode über die Kunst" of the early 1770s
                            foreshadowing Blake’s <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>
                            in its praise of Michelangelo and outline at the expense of Titian,
                            Correggio, and coloring. (Though Raphael, too, was one of
                            Fuseli’s effeminate demons!) Fuseli’s exclamation
                            "Hölle, sei mir gegrüsset!"
                            appears to echo Blake’s <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi>, and any
                            Blake scholar will feel at home with the attacks on kings and priests
                            that are launched repeatedly. <note id="n145"><hi rend="s">6</hi> Cf.

            <p>Guthke’s "Nachwort" supplies the reader with
                            yet another short biography of Fuseli which, though there is nothing new
                            in it, is necessary to an understanding of the various auto-biographical
                            pieces. Rather more important is the analysis of the obvious
                            discrepancies between Fuseli’s poetic and pictorial <hi rend="i">oeuvres</hi>, and Guthke is also helpful with respect to
                            the formal development of Fuseli’s poetry in its historical
                            context. Mason’s introduction to the edition of 1951,
                            however, is not superseded by Guthke and Bircher. In my opinion it
                            remains the most detailed and balanced account of Fuseli’s
                            poetic achievement that has been published to the present day.<ref target="n146" type="note">7</ref><note id="n146"><hi rend="s">7</hi> See Mason 1951, pp. 7-45. The

                                learned about the Fuseli poems in the

            <p>Though the title promises <hi rend="i">Sämtliche

                            unknown reasons the lyrical fragments among Fuseli’s letters,
                            which are known from Federmann’s book,<ref target="n147" type="note">8</ref> have been left out. Also, I am not entirely
                            comfortable with the editorial principles employed in this first, and
                            probably for a long time to come the only, collection of
                            Fuseli’s poetry that is available to a wide public. Too much
                            may have been left to the uncontrollable "Ermessen des
                                Herausgebers"<ref target="n148" type="note">9</ref> and the
                            extent of Bircher’s "modernizing" can be
                            only estimated by comparing the facsimile reproductions of the
                            manuscripts with the edited versions.<ref target="n149" type="note">10</ref> This may be justified by the attempt to achieve
                            "eine lesbare . . . Textform;" I doubt, however, that
                            the same text can meet with the demands of a "wissenschaftlich
                            zuverlässige Textform."<ref target="n150" type="note">11</ref> In any case, the incompleteness in the
                            apparatus of variants will be regretted in the long run, especially by
                            those scholars who cannot easily consult the original manuscripts in
                            Appledore (Ashford, Kent), Berlin, and Zurich. And yet, if Bircher and
                            Guthke’s edition is measured against what we had before,
                            these criticisms shrink to their proper proportions. While Fuseli may be
                            only a minor Swiss poet, the publication of this handsome little
                            volume—about the size of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi>—should nevertheless be welcomed
                            for the insight it makes possible into the painter’s feelings

                            exhibition, concentrating on the Auckland Fuselis, travelled to various
                            cities in Australia and New Zealand from April to November 1979. The
                            Auckland drawings did not come to scholarly light until 1963; they were
                            then published in Peter Tomory’s important catalogue of 1967.

                            Fuseli’s designs were put into proper perspective: the 100

                            Jefferys, Mortimer, Romney, and Alexander Runciman, forming, according

                            enthusiasts, Tomory’s new hypothesis that the engraver

            <p>Besides the Milan catalogue, another Italian effort in Fuseli studies
                            ought to be mentioned. <hi rend="i">L’opera completa di

                            often show a beastly tinge of red which of course is absent from the

            <p>In spite of the warnings of Anthony Blunt and others,<ref target="n159" type="note">20</ref> both Blake and Fuseli scholars, where dealing
                            with the relation between the two artists, have all too often been
                            preoccupied with establishing dubious priorities in the use of this or
                            that motif. It is to be hoped that the wealth of materials published by
                            now, including some listed in this announcement, will help in tackling
                            more ingenious questions. Thus, the similarities in subject matter may
                            be weighed against the basic differences in personal style; Fuseli, the
                            outsider inside the academic system may confront Blake, the outsider
                            outside all systems but his own; Fuseli, as a representative of the <hi rend="i">Cinquecento</hi> tradition may be set against Blake, the
                            "creator as destroyer."<ref target="n160" type="note">21</ref> I can think of no Fuseli painting which would be mistaken
                            as a Blake—in the present state of research it seems to be
                            worthwhile to accept the challenge and to ask why. What is needed now is
                            a comparistic investigation of the formal constituents of a number of
                            iconographically similar works by both artists. I should think that we
                            all have had enough of the narrow-minded and partial quarrels between
                            Fuselians and Blakeans, which often appear to be as irrelevant as they
                            are subjective, characterized by a mutual ignorance of the results of
                            the literature in the neighboring field of studies.<ref target="n161" type="note">22</ref> The latter, at least, need not be, and in the

                                "Antiquity" in Blake’s work; he made
                                use of them, however, in a radically non-affirmative way. To
                                simplify matters: where the Swiss-born painter draws on artistic and
                                intellectual traditions, he does so as an
                                "imitator" (understood according to the definition
                                in his own first Academy lecture); Blake’s strengths and
                                weaknesses, on the other hand, originate in a method of
                                "Copying" based on
                                "Inspiration," not "Mnemosyne."

            <p>From Aardvark to Z Theatre Company, in music, dance, mime and drama,
                            there were over 330 shows, including 180 premieres, on offer at the 1980
                            Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Listed in the Fringe program between a revue
                            called <hi rend="i">West Ham v. Hearts</hi> and a play named <hi rend="i">The Human Puppet Theatre</hi>, the eye was arrested by the
                            detail that Marlborough College’s production of
                            Blake’s <hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi> would be playing
                            three shows a day during the second week of the Festival, sponsored by
                            the prestigious and enterprising Richard Demarco Gallery.</p>
            <p>The Edinburgh Fringe is a unique jewel in the cultural life of Britain.
                            For three weeks in late summer a bewildering mixture of professional and
                            amateur groups from both sides of the Atlantic compete to fill
                            excruciatingly uncomfortable seats hastily installed in countless church
                            halls, schools, <pb id="p15-57" n="57"/> youth centers, at least one
                            enlightened nightclub, the odd marquee and perhaps even a few
                            "legitimate" theatres. Audiences can be tiny even at
                            the very low prices charged and Fringegoers can be as choosy as they
                            please. If Prickly Heat University’s production of
                            Genet’s juvenilia proves to be less than definitive, it can
                            be consoling to know that Add Hock Th. Co. will be opening at the other
                            end of the street in ten minutes’ time.</p>
            <p>Not that more philosophical tastes are neglected. <hi rend="i">The Ghost
                                of Abel</hi>, produced by one of Britain’s leading
                            independent schools, under the direction of Michael Davis, proved an
                            engaging and demanding event that crammed much into its half-hour
                            playing time. Rather than leaving Blake crying in the wilderness to a
                            passing audience perhaps unfamiliar with English romanticism (or even
                            Cain and Abel), it had been decided to present Blake’s drama
                            as the last statement in a gradually unfolding Christian myth beginning
                            with Genesis 4 and then proceeding to <hi rend="i">The Ghost of
                                Abel</hi> via extracts from Coleridge’s <hi rend="i">The
                                Wanderings of Cain</hi> and Byron’s <hi rend="i">Cain: A
                                Mystery.</hi></p>
            <p>Marlborough College was not the only company operating from St.
                            Francis’ Hall, and its show was sandwiched between two other
                            groups performing almost immediately before and after. Such a quick
                            change around must have been difficult for everyone. A church-hall
                            accommodating a succession of performances cannot offer much in the way
                            of normal theatrical facilities and Michael Davis was wise to opt for
                            simple uniform of jeans and kaftans for his cast.</p>
            <p>The play began with a semi-ritualistic enactment of the Cain and Abel
                            section of Genesis with each verse spoken by a different actor. In this
                            scene, and at times throughout the play, a seated chorus of onlookers
                            was used to good effect in echoing the stylized facial and grouping
                            characteristics of the Job designs. Indeed, one could have wished that
                            the nettle of the language of stylized gesture had been grasped more
                            firmly and confidently by the company, because it is a mode of
                            expression that seems particularly well suited to swiftly moving
                            epigrammatic language.</p>
            <p>Coleridge’s <hi rend="i">The Wanderings of Cain</hi> does not
                            adapt easily to the stage, even in abridgement, but Cain’s
                            subtle edging towards repentance is quite close to Blake’s
                            lines on the forgiveness of sins which concluded this episode.
                            Furthermore, the Coleridge piece was dramatically relevant because it
                            introduces Abel’s ghost, which is not present in
                            Byron’s play. Byron’s <hi rend="i">Cain: A
                                Mystery</hi> was a successful third movement not merely because it
                            directly gave rise to <hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi> but also
                            because it contains promisingly dramatic writing. Adam’s
                            "Eve! let not his, / Thy natural grief, lead to
                            impiety" sounded eminently mealy-mouthed in contrast to
                            Eve’s almost shrewish "His will! . . . . May all the
                            curses / Of life be on him!" These are appropriate colleagues
                            for Los and Enitharmon in their weaker moments and suitable precursors
                            for elements in Blake’s Adam and Eve. The skillfully cut <hi rend="i">Cain: A Mystery</hi> ended with Cain in painful
                            self-knowledge addressing Abel’s corpse and providing a cue
                            for <hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi>: "Now for the
                            wilderness!"</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi> was heralded by choice Blake epigrams
                            and part of the preface to <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> The slightly
                            augmented title, "A Revelation In The Vision of Elohim Jehovah
                            Seen by William Blake, Dedicated to Lord Byron in the
                            Wilderness," made a convincingly firm curtain opener and even
                            Blake’s "stage" directions sounded well. In
                            this strenuous evening one was driving four-handed with the Bible,
                            Coleridge, Byron and Blake, but the easy syntax of <hi rend="i">The
                                Ghost of Abel</hi> came across with exceptional clarity, as did the
                            movements of the actors. A line of standing figures became first a grave
                            and then a row of flames from which Satan emerged. One caught fleeting
                            echoes of the illuminated books in the stances and positions of the
                            players.</p>
            <p>Marlborough College ended by following Blake’s invitation to
                            "Sing," and it was here that I had my only
                            reservations. Blake’s "Peace, Brotherhood and
                            Love" has a grand simplicity of message that makes it suitable
                            for the refrain of a song, as Michael Davis correctly recognized, but
                            one felt that they too easily translated it into a Sixties-type pop
                            culture hymn. However, this may have been a sensible arrangement for a
                            cast in its mid-teens and without benefit of musical accompaniment.</p>
            <p>Was this a successful theatrical experiment? The answer must be yes. The
                            Bible stories are the stuff of the oldest traditions of English drama
                            and seeing Coleridge’s, Byron’s and
                            Blake’s interpretations of the same story together in the
                            space of half an hour was a valuable experience. The virtue of Michael
                            Davis’ production was that it set all three in vivid context.
                            One may now ask others with bigger and better resources to try and do
                            likewise in this surprising and largely untrodden area of
                            romanticism.</p>

          <p>Perhaps it is well to have further discussion of the inscription on
                        Blake’s sketch: see David Bindman, "The Dead Ardours
                        Revisited," <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 56, Spring 1981, p. 211,
                        querying my "Leonora, Laodamia, and the Dead Ardours," <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 54, Fall 1980, pp. 96-98. Bindman and I have both
                        examined the original sketch, in his collection, while the photograph of it
                            <hi rend="i">as reproduced</hi> in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 54 has given
                        people a wretchedly faint image to examine. Here, with better reproductive
                        results be it hoped, is a re-photographing on high-contrast paper, giving
                        much sharper definition.</p>
          <p>"There can be no doubt about the initial words ‘The
                        dead’," Bindman agrees, adding: "nor, I
                        believe, that they are in Blake’s own formal script, but it is
                        still not even clear how many words follow." He also questions
                        whether Blake was the one who put his initials in the far left and whether
                        "Perry" can possibly be the word crowded in at the end of
                        the inscription—though he apparently takes it to be in
                        Blake’s hand: to Bindman it seems "very improbable that
                        Blake would have brought in the name of such an obscure engraver in this
                        way, in the same formal script as the title, even if there were other
                        evidence to connect it with the <hi rend="i">Leonora</hi>
                        engravings."</p>
          <figure>
            <head>W B. The dead ardours Perry David Bindman Collection.</head>
          </figure>
          <p>I find it hard to conceive of anything that would more powerfully connect
                        this design with the design which Blake made and Perry etched for <hi rend="i">Leonora</hi> (see plate 380 in Bindman’s <hi rend="i">Complete Graphic Works of Blake</hi>) than the striking
                        resemblances between the "dead" somethings in this sketch
                        and the "Forms" "of Death" (according to
                        line 2 of its inscription) in that plate that was etched and published. To
                        Blake, Perry need not have been "an obscure engraver" even
                        though he was a bad one and we may suppose that Blake disliked, not his
                        obscurity, but his ugly transformation of Blake’s faces and
                        bodies with his stippling deconstruction.</p>
          <p>That the word I have read as "Perry" might rather be a word
                        integral to the caption, as Bindman implies, seems to be ruled out by the
                        nature of the caption as a mock-up or layout, something I alluded to before
                        but have now given closer attention to, thanks to the questioning.
                        Lettering, in a design plan, is not inscribed but positioned. Bindman makes
                        no note of the letters "VOLUME" which have been partly cut
                        off but are visible in the upper left portion of the sketch. It will be left
                        to a lettering engraver to inscribe that half-title. And even the caption
                        itself, far from being all in "Blake’s own formal
                        script," is approximately formal only in the opening
                        "The" and the second and third "d". The
                        smaller letters are only roughly indicated, to lay out the spacing, if later
                        revised a bit for legibility. In short, this is not a finished inscription
                        but a mock-up for an engraver to follow in his own style. In the three
                        stipple engravings actually used in <hi rend="i">Leonora</hi> it seems
                        evident that the identifying phrases "Blake inv:" and
                        "Perry sc:" in the corners of the plates were not
                        inscribed by Blake: quite possibly they were not inscribed by Perry either
                        but by a specializing lettering engraver.</p>
          <pb id="p15-59" n="59"/>
          <p>Thanks to David Bindman’s query, I can now see that the
                        "P" of "Perry" is rather more like the
                        "P" as engraved in the published plates than it is like
                        Blake’s—though, <hi rend="i">pace</hi>
                        Bindman’s other viewers of the original sketch, nothing like a
                        formal "L" can be seen here. The letter is a formal
                        "P" in the style of copperplate hand employed by Blake
                        (see "O Prince" for a flourished example, in <hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 38:15) as well as in that of the lettering engraver.</p>
          <p>Why should "Perry" be crowded up so against the last word
                        of the caption, and too close for a properly flourishing
                        "P"? And why "W.B." put off toward the
                        left edge? I take it that although the caption itself had to be carefully
                        spaced and its style indicated, the placing of the names would depend on the
                        final shaping of the plate. They were simply jotted here, by Perry or by
                        some foreman, as reminders. If the design were used as a vignette under
                        "SECOND VOLUME" (to guess at a number) it might float as a
                        cloud above blank space and the names be tucked inconspicuously under the
                        corners of the cloud: compare Bindman, plates 381 and 382.</p>
          <p>As for the caption itself, however, infrared photography yields no trace of
                        any letter where Bindman hesitantly conjectures (and abandons) a
                        "b" for "bard." But
                        "ardours" stands out even more clearly than
                        "dead"; the pencil mending Bindman mentions I take to be
                        Blake’s turning the sketch into setting-copy, so to speak. If the
                        New Mexico printer doesn’t now betray us, I think no one need
                        worry further about this transcription. David Bindman, however, has
                        generously invited the curious to consult the original.</p>
          <p>And what next? Perhaps someone working in publishing history will discover
                        what aborted Volume these ardours were intended to adorn.</p>

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>A session on "Blake and Criticism," organized by Thomas A.
                        Vogler (Univ. of California, Santa Cruz), has been approved for the 1981
                        annual meeting of the MLA in New York. The theme of the session will be
                        "Blake as a self-conscious critic and theorist of language and
                        literature, one who anticipated the principal issues in the current
                        theoretical debate, and addressed them in ways that deserve exploration at
                        this time." Brief papers will be presented by Nelson Hilton (Univ.
                        of Georgia), Morris Eaves (Univ. of New Mexico), and Paul Mann (Univ. of
                        Texas at Dallas), and the papers will be followed by a response from W. J.
                        T. Mitchell (Univ. of Chicago). The time and place for this session will be
                        announced later this year.</p>

                        re-emerged on the auction market after a disappearance of over sixty years.
                        At an unknown time, the great bibliophile H. Buxton Forman acquired at least
                        ninety-eight posthumous impressions of the <hi rend="i">Songs.</hi> These he
                        had mounted on linen stubs and bound in three volumes in dark maroon levant
                        morocco, Jansen style, with elaborately gilt dentelles. Each is stamped on
                        the tail of the front paste-down end-paper "BOUND BY RIVIERE
                        &amp; SON FOR H. BUXTON FORMAN" and each bears
                        Forman’s bookplate on the inside front cover. One volume,

                        containing 23 plates, is now at Princeton; another (g<hi rend="s">2</hi>),
                        with 18 plates, is in the Rosenwald Collection of the Library of Congress.
                        The third and largest volume (h), containing 57 plates on 57 leaves,
                        disappeared after its sale to the bookdealer A. S. W. Rosenbach at the
                        Buxton Forman auction at Anderson Galleries in New York on 15 March 1920,
                        lot 53 ($90). This volume, not previously described in any detail, has now
                        come to light at Christie’s New York auction of 22 May 1981, lot
                        36, with "A Divine Image" and "The Sick

                        (brown), b (dark reddish brown—clearly a different ink than the
                        other brown; ATMAN/832). Plate 15, "Laughing Song," is
                        lacking; it is not included in any of the three volumes bound up for
                        Forman.</p>
          <p>The leaves measure approximately 28 × 19.5 cm., except that the
                        first leaf and the 45th (bearing "To Tirzah" in gray) are
                        short at the bottom, only 24.1 and 24.3 cm. high respectively. This is the
                        approximate leaf size in copies g<hi rend="s">1</hi> and g<hi rend="s">2</hi>. These two smaller leaves are a slightly thicker wove paper than
                        all the rest. Each leaf is numbered in pencil consecutively, 1 through 57,
                        below the lower left corner of the plate. Other pencil inscriptions are
                        "KSNS/200 (clearly a bookdealer’s notation) on the verso
                        of the front free endpaper, "2" below the plate on the
                        first leaf, "Gilchrist calls this ‘Christian
                        Forbearance’ II. 65 1863" below "A Poison
                        Tree" on the 41st leaf, and "20" on the verso of
                        the last leaf (bearing "A Divine Image" on its recto).</p>
          <p>Three plates are partly hand colored in water colors. Plate 38,
                        "Nurse’s Song" in <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>,
                        is awkwardly painted in green, rose red, blue, and yellow, with the title
                        gone over in gold. The pale blue, green, and yellow washed on plate 40,
                        "The Fly," are more skillfully applied. Plate 45,
                        "The Little Vagabond," has been touched with blue and
                        olive green in a few spots.</p>
          <p>The vendor of copy h at Christie’s auction was Charlton M. Theus,
                        Jr. According to his letter to me of 11 June 1981, Mr. Theus acquired the
                        book <hi rend="i">c.</hi> 1946 from Mr. Reid, a bookseller of Chesterton,
                        South Carolina. I have not been able to learn anything of the
                        book’s whereabouts between 1920 and 1946.</p>
          <p>Like all posthumous copies of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> I have seen, copy h
                        contains a good many poorly inked and printed impressions. Some plates were
                        printed with such great pressure that they have been embossed into the
                        paper. But copy h has one distinctive characteristic. With its three
                        duplicate plates (1, 52, 53) and inclusion of only the sixth known
                        impression of "A Divine Image," it has more plates than
                        any other copy of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience.</hi>
