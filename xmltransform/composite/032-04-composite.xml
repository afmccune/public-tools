          <p>The cycle of lean and fat years in the Blake marketplace continues. After a hectic pace in 1997, collectors deserved a respite in 1998. The one major event was the auction of the larger Blake-Varley sketchbook (illus. 1-3), for the last several years on deposit at the Tate Gallery. Succeeding where Christie’s had failed nine years earlier, Sotheby’s sold the album on 8 April to a private collector for £216,000. Rumor in the London art world has it that this anonymous purchaser was David Thompson, the son of Lord Thompson of Fleet and hitherto known primarily as a collector of drawings by John Constable. Thompson may also be the new owner of Blake’s water colors illustrating Bunyan’s <hi rend="i">Pilgrim’s Progress</hi>, sold in 1996 (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 30 [1997]: 100-01, illus. 1-5), and <hi rend="i">The Elders of Israel Receiving the Ten Commandments</hi> (see entry below and illus. 4). The auction price for the sketchbook probably represents one bid above the “reserve” (the bid below which a lot will not be sold) plus auction-house fees. If we relegate the Varley drawings to financial inconsequence, then each of the 40 Blake drawings (including several less-valuable counterproofs) achieved a price of £5400. Buying in bulk—be it grain or art—generally means a lower per-unit cost than for a single example. Thus, original Visionary Heads sold individually should be worth, on average, perhaps 20% more than the per-drawing price at this sale. At least this auction probably established a benchmark price, one a little higher than what counterproofs should command and a little lower than what originals are likely to fetch at auctions.</p>
          <p>While the market for Blake’s drawings is strong, probably due in part to a single new, eager, and wealthy buyer, Blake’s prints showed some weakness by the end of the year, as indicated by the failed attempt to auction an impression of “The Man Sweeping the Interpreter’s Parlour.” Three examples have been sold at public auction since 1991, each fetching between $60,500 and $98,000. Perhaps the high end of the market for Blake’s prints, always “thin” because dependent on just two or three major collectors, has become saturated for a year or two, at least for “The Man Sweeping.” To put it bluntly, everyone who wants this print—and can afford it—already has it.</p>
          <p>It is always satisfying, even pleasantly romantic, when partners that have been rent asunder are reunited. Such is the case with the Huntington Library’s acquisition of the original receipt, signed by Blake, very probably for copy E of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> also in that remarkable institution’s collection. See the single entry under “Manuscripts,” below.</p>
          <p>In 1974, Princeton University Library acquired what at the time was the only known copy of the first prospectus of November 1805 for R. H. Cromek’s 1808 edition of Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> illustrated by Blake. This ephemeral document is exceedingly important, for it validates Blake’s claim that he was originally hired by Cromek to both design and engrave the illustrations. A second copy, with manuscript annotations by Cromek indicating (like the second prospectus of the same month) that Louis Schiavonetti would be the engraver, came to light 10 years later and was sold by Sotheby’s on 23 July 1985 (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 20 [1986]: 13, 20, 25). The auction house emphasized the significance of the lot in its catalogue description, claimed (mistakenly) that it was the only known copy, and found a purchaser at £5500, surely a record for any prospectus concerning Blake. I have not been able to trace this second copy; but another, unannotated, surfaced in 1998 at another Sotheby’s auction—see the entry below following Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave.</hi> This third known example was taped into a copy of the book in original boards. Although the sale catalogue mentioned its presence in passing, the prospectus was well hidden and the lot achieved a “hammer price” (the winning bid, not including fees) of £950—only about £250 more than the value of the book alone. The prospectus is now in my collection, removed from the book.</p>
          <p>In <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 31 (1998): 109, 114, I reported the death of George Goyder and noted that two of the tempera paintings from his collection, <hi rend="i">Christ the Mediator</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Flight into Egypt</hi> (Butlin #429, 404) were on long-term loan to the Tate Gallery, London. Dan Goyder, one of George’s children, has kindly informed me in a letter of March 1998 that these works remain at the Tate and that it is the family’s present intention to give them to that institution. He further reports that the following works from the Goyder collection are on long-term loan to the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge:
<q><hi rend="i">God Judging Adam</hi>, pen and water color. Butlin #258<lb/><hi rend="i">The Fall of Fair Rosamond</hi>, pencil. Butlin #607<lb/><hi rend="i">The Christ Child Asleep on a Cross</hi>, tempera. Butlin #410<lb/>
“The Man Sweeping the Interpreter’s Parlour,”
white-line metal cut. Essick impression 2F
</q></p>
          <p>Three sheets of drawings apparently remain in the Goyder family’s collection:
<q><hi rend="i">Frolic</hi>, pencil. Butlin #211<lb/><hi rend="i">The Devil Outside a Church</hi>, pencil. Butlin #598<lb/><hi rend="i">Two Sketches for “The Devil outside a Church”</hi> (recto)
and <hi rend="i">A Woman and Child before a Church with Other</hi><lb/><hi rend="i">Figures Passing By</hi> (verso), pencil. Butlin #599
</q></p>

          <p>Since 1919, the Whitney family of New York has owned one of two known impressions of Blake’s 1795 color print, <hi rend="i">The Good and Evil Angels Struggling for Possession of a Child</hi> (Butlin #324). This is arguably one of the most important Blake pictures still in private hands; I can remember being greatly impressed by it when it was on display at the Yale Center for British Art and the Art Gallery of Ontario (Toronto) in 1982-83 (see David Bindman, <hi rend="i">William Blake: His Art and Times</hi> [London: Thames and Hudson, 1982] #53 and color illus. vii). Recently, the painting/print was owned by Betsey Cushing Whitney. She died on 28 March 1998, leaving many works from her vast art collection (valued at 200 million dollars in the press) to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and other institutions. The Blake, however, remains in Mrs. Whitney’s estate; according to S. Jeanne Hall, the co-executor, “its disposition has not yet been determined” (letter to me of 29 October 1998). I will do my best to keep readers apprised of the whereabouts of <hi rend="i">The Good and Evil Angels</hi> in future years. Copy N of <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> and copy E of <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> were last recorded in the collection of Mrs. Harry Paine Whitney; perhaps an inventory of Betsey Whitney’s estate will reveal these treasures as well. For a painting by Fuseli thematically related to <hi rend="i">The Good and Evil Angels</hi>, see illus. 6.</p>
          <p>Swann Galleries, the New York auction house, included an impression of “Fire,” plate 7 (inscribed “5”) from Blake’s <hi rend="i">For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise</hi>, in its 12 November sale of “Works of Art on Paper,” lot 185. The catalogue entry reported that the print was in the “Second state (of 2)”—actually, 2nd state of at least 4—and showed a “partial indiscernable [sic] watermark” and a platemark of 11.5 × 9.0 cm. This measurement could not fail to raise questions, since all previously recorded impressions reveal a platemark of 9.1 × 7.3 cm. The platemark of the Swann impression is close to the facsimile platemark surrounding the reproduction of plate 7, 2nd state, included in W. A. White’s privately printed edition of <hi rend="i">For the Sexes</hi>, probably based on copy D (now Pierpont Morgan Library) and issued loose in portfolio c. 1897 (Bentley #46). The White platemark is beveled at a shallow angle and thus makes two embossments in the paper; depending on which indentations one measures, the platemark can be recorded at a maximum of 12 × 9.0 cm. and a minimum of 11.3 × 8.1 cm. A color xerox of the Swann impression, kindly supplied by Sybil Rodgers of Swann’s print department, hints at a similar platemark, faint and with a shallow bevel. Rodgers also informed me that their impression was on a sheet of laid paper, 20.3 × 17.4 cm., with chain lines approx. 2.5 cm. apart. All original impressions known to me are on wove paper; the White reproduction is on a sheet of machine-made paper, without chain lines real or faked, measuring 22.8 × 14 cm.

          <p>John Windle, the San Francisco book dealer, has issued another catalogue devoted exclusively to Blake. The November 1998 “List Twenty-Nine” offers 221 lots ranging in price from $15,500 for a handsome copy of Thornton’s Virgil (1821) with Blake’s wood engravings to $7.50 for an off-print of a 1954 journal article by H. M. Margoliouth. Items from Windle’s catalogue relevant to this review are detailed under the appropriate sections and titles below.</p>
          <p>An increasing number of antiquarian book dealers are listing their stock on the internet. Bibliofind &lt;www.bibliofind.com&gt;, the Advanced Book Exchange &lt;www.abebooks.com&gt;, and MX BookFinder
<pb id="p32-94" n="94"/>
&lt;www.mxbf.com&gt; offer searchable/virtual catalogues provided by many dealers. When I searched “Blake, William” on the Book Exchange in June 1998, I got over 200 “hits”—mostly editions of Blake’s writings and Blake Trust facsimiles. The titles relevant to this sales review are listed below under the specific dealer’s name followed by the month I discovered the listing (not necessarily the month of initial posting) and “on-line cat.” These entries do not include a catalogue item number, there being none in hyperspace. Buying on the internet is rapidly transforming the bookselling trade, both new and used. Serious collectors, individual and institutional, will surely make ever-increasing use of this new resource. One warning: it is easy to get ripped off by internet intruders if you send your credit-card number to the web sites noted above.</p>
          <p>The year of all sales and catalogues in the following lists is 1998 unless indicated otherwise. The auction houses add their purchaser’s surcharge to the hammer price in their price lists. These net amounts are given here, following the official price lists. The value-added tax levied against the buyer’s surcharge in Britain is not included. Late 1998 sales will be covered in the 1999 review. I am grateful for help in compiling this review to Detlef Dörrbecker (my continental spy), Andrew Edmunds, Dan Goyder, S. Jeanne Hall, Thomas V. Lange, Jane Munro, Sybil Rodgers (Swann Galleries), Charles Ryskamp, John Windle, and Henry Wemyss. Once again, Patricia Neill’s editorial assistance and John Sullivan’s electronic imaging have been invaluable.</p>

              <figDesc>Both pencil, sheets 25.5 × 20 cm. Inscribed in pencil by Varley, “Milton when Young” and “Milton” (drawing on left); “Wat Tyler’s Daughter / striving to get loose from the Tax gatherer” (drawing on right, inscription not pictured). There are some similarities—particularly in the mouth, hair, and arch of the eyebrows—between Blake’s rendition of the young Milton and the “Elderton” miniature, believed in Blake’s day to be a portrait of Milton. The miniature was engraved by Blake’s master, James Basire, for <hi rend="i">The Gentleman’s Magazine</hi> 62 (Jan. 1792): pl. 3 fig. 1, facing p. 17. Blake and/or Varley made the common confusion between John Tyler, a blacksmith whose daughter was attacked by a “tax gatherer,” and Wat Tyler, the leader of the Peasant Revolt in 1381. The same error appears in the caption to Henry Fuseli’s “Wat Tyler and the Tax-gatherer,” engraved by Blake for Charles Allen, <hi rend="i">A New and Improved History of England</hi> (1798).

                <head>6 Henry Fuseli.</head>
                <figDesc><hi rend="i">Sigelind, Siegfried’s Mother, Roused by the Contest of the Good and Evil Genius about Her Infant Son—Lied der Nibelunge.</hi> Oil, 71 × 91.5 cm., exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1814. The event pictured is not described in the <hi rend="i">Nibelungenlied</hi> and would appear to be Fuseli’s own interpolated addition to the poem. The descending “good” spirit recalls several figures in Blake’s work, including the pearl diver in his water-color illustration to Edward Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, Night V, p. 19 (Butlin #330.174). Gert Schiff has compared this <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> figure to Titania in one of Fuseli’s paintings based on Christoph Martin Wieland’s <hi rend="i">Oberon</hi>—see Schiff, <hi rend="i">Johann Heinrich Füssli</hi> (Zurich: Verlag Berichthaus, 1973) 2: illus. 1226 and unnumbered illus. below it. But the possibilities of Blake’s influence on the theme of the painting reproduced here are more intriguing than formal parallels. Perhaps Fuseli’s invention of the scene pictured was prompted by Blake’s color print, <hi rend="i">The Good and Evil Angels Struggling for Possession of a Child.</hi> The impression now in the Whitney estate (Butlin #324—see discussion in the introductory essay above) was probably executed in 1795 and appears to have remained in Blake’s possession until his death in 1827. Thus, Fuseli would have had ample opportunity to see the work when visiting his friend of many years. As Fuseli is said to have claimed, “Blake is d—d good to steal from!” (Alexander Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi> [London and Cambridge: Macmillan, 1863] 1:52). When sold at Sotheby’s on 25 November 1989, Fuseli’s painting was in poor condition, particularly in the darker passages where the bitumen had decayed badly. Perhaps the new owner has already embarked on its restoration. Photo courtesy of Christie’s London.</figDesc>

              </title>
            </head>
            <p>In my 1997 sales review (<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 31 [1998]: 108-37), I reproduced as illus. 1 an impression of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pl. 1 (“The Ancient of Days”) now in my collection. In the caption to this illustration, I failed to indicate that Bentley 340 states that a “note on the verso” of this impression “says it is from the Smith and Biddle collections.” I can find no evidence of such an inscription on the verso of the print itself. However, the brown wrapping-paper backing (now also in my collection) for the frame in which the print was mounted while in Leonard Baskin’s possession (June 1964 to May 1997) is inscribed, in rather elaborate ink script by Baskin, as follows: “W<hi rend="s">m</hi> Blake / Frontispiece for =Europe= / From the Biddle-Smith Coll:<hi rend="s">s</hi> / From the 1832 posthumous ed. by / Fred.<hi rend="s">k</hi> Tathem [sic], / of which / only one copy known- / M. Zhn [i.e., Mabel Zahn] of Sesslers suggests a proof=.” Since this impression is neither a “proof” (in the sense of representing a state of the copperplate earlier than the one published in all but proof copy a of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>) nor a posthumous printing, the only part of this inscription that strikes me as accurate is the provenance information tracing the print to the Smith and Biddle collections.</p>

              </title>
            </head>
            <p>This division is organized by individual (say, William Hayley or John Flaxman), with works by and about Blake’s friends and patrons, living individuals with whom he had significant direct and demonstrable contact. It includes Thomas Butts, Robert Hartley Cromek, George Cumberland, John Flaxman and his family, Henry Fuseli, Thomas and William Hayley, John Linnell and his family, Samuel Palmer, James Parker, George Richmond, Thomas Stothard, and John Varley. It does <hi rend="i">not</hi> include important contemporaries with whom Blake’s contact was negligible or non-existent such as John Constable and William Wordsworth and Edmund Burke; such major figures are dealt with more comprehensively elsewhere, and the light they throw upon Blake is very dim.</p>

            <p>The status of electronic “publications” becomes increasingly vexing. Some such works seem to be merely electronic versions of physically stable works, such as <hi rend="i">Colliers Encyclopedia-CD Rom</hi> (1996), with essays by Charles P. Parkhurst, Jr., on Fuseli and Flaxman and by Geoffrey Keynes on Blake (1966) &lt;<hi rend="i">BB</hi> #2040, which replaced that by Mark Schorer and Charles P. Parkhurst, Jr., <hi rend="i">BB</hi> #2673&gt;. Some electronic publications, however, suggest no more knowledge than how to operate a computer, such as reviews invited for the listings of the book-sale firm of Amazon.com, which are divided into those by (1) the author, (2) the publisher, and (3) other, perhaps disinterested, remarkers. I have not searched for electronic publications, and I report here only those I have happened upon which appear to bear some authority.<ref target="n5" type="note">5</ref><note id="n5"><hi rend="s">5</hi> E.g., Baulch, David M. “The Sublime of the Bible.” <hi rend="i">Romanticism On the Net 3</hi> (August 1996).

            <p>The languages of recent Blake criticism are remarkably various.

            <p>There are also variously titled collected editions of his poems in English (1996, 1997, 1998), Italian (1991 [2], 1996, 1997), and Russian (1978), plus fragments such as <hi rend="i">Auguries of Innocence</hi> (1997), <hi rend="i">I asked [a Thief]</hi> (1989), <hi rend="i">A Poison Tree</hi> (1989), and <hi rend="i">Proverbs of Hell</hi> in French (1996).

            <p>There was no major Blake exhibition in 1998, though there were modest shows in Birmingham (England) and Kanagawa (Japan). Perhaps the most interesting new catalogue information is to be found in the 1923 sale of the egregious Richard C. Jackson.</p>
            <p>However, there were several significant public events associated with Blake: The conference on “Blake and the Book” at Strawberry Hill (England) on 18 April 1998; the series of lectures called “Blake Course at the Tate Gallery” in London (England) on 12 May-9 June 1998; the lecture series on “William Blake &amp; His Circle” at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery (England) on 22 June-6 September 1998; and the Blake Festival as part of the annual Olavfestdagene in Trondheim (Norway) on 25-28 July 1998.</p>

            <p>The number of newly recorded works about Blake is substantial. These include 147 essays of 1835-1998, plus 39 reprinted essays, eight doctoral dissertations, and 58 reviews (1835-1998), 25 of them by David Worrall in <hi rend="i">The Year’s Work in English Studies.</hi></p>
            <p>“Dialectical” seems to be a term whose time has come, especially among dissertation-writers, as in Bryan Nemo
<pb id="p32-116" n="116"/>
Alexander, “Dialectical Nightmares: The Historicity of the Romantic-Era Doppelganger in the Works of Godwin, Hogg, Blake, Burney, and the Shelleys” (Michigan Ph.D., 1997), John Sebastian Howard, “Romantic Dialectics and the Politics of the Subject” (Saint Louis Ph.D., 1997), Susan Ann Weaver, “Dialectical Formulations and Covert Language in Coleridge, Blake, and [Mary] Robinson,” (Texas A&amp;M Ph.D., 1997), plus of course Fred Dortort, <hi rend="i">The Dialectic of Vision</hi> (1998). The fact that a term is critically popular does not, of course, mean that it is critically abused, but some of its uses here seem to be unfamiliar ones.</p>
            <p>Other popular subjects are gender, maternity (but not matriarchy), patriarchy (but not paternity), and the sexual machine.</p>
            <p>This list records eight doctorates on Blake in institutions from St. Petersburg to St. Louis to Calicut (India). The number of dissertations seems to be about the same as in recent years, but the geographical range is a good deal wider.</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> alone carried nine essays, 10 reviews, and eight newsletter snippets. The most important of these are Robert Essick’s “Blake in the Marketplace” and the essay by Essick and Morton Paley on the newly discovered Blake letter of 1 September 1800.</p>
            <p>In what is essentially a 27-page essay, Richard Outram’s <hi rend="i">Notes on William Blake’s “The Tyger”</hi> (1997) explores ground gratifyingly unfamiliar to most Blake scholars, particularly on the influences of bestiaries and heraldry on “The Tyger.”</p>
            <p>The 19 essays collected in <hi rend="i">Blake, Politics, and History</hi>, ed. Jackie DiSalvo, G. A. Rosso, and Christopher Z. Hobson (1997) cover much of the spectrum of political interest which has informed much of the best Blake scholarship of the last 50 years. One of the most lastingly valuable of these is the essay by Jon Mee about the vocabulary of violent republicanism and radical protestantism shared by William Blake and Richard Lee, called “Citizen Lee,” the author of <hi rend="i">King Killing</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Happy Reign of George the Last.</hi> In passing Mee remarks most promisingly: “we have to be circumspect about claiming that Blake was ever a member of the [<hi rend="i">Joseph</hi>] Johnson circle.”<ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref><note id="n6"><hi rend="s">6</hi> Jon Mee, “‘The Doom of Tyrants’: William Blake, Richard ‘Citizen’ Lee, and the Millenarían Public Sphere,” <hi rend="i">Blake, Politics, and History</hi>, ed. Jackie DiSalvo, G. A. Rosso, and Christopher Z. Hobson (1998) 103.</note></p>
            <p>Similarly, the background details of radical regency political agitation provided by David Worrall shed a fundamentally new light on Blake’s somewhat conventional engraving of the conventionally pretty “Mrs Q,” the Prince Regent’s sometime mistress whom he had cast off as he was trying in 1820 to cast off Queen Charlotte.<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref><note id="n7"><hi rend="s">7</hi> David Worrall, “The Mob and ‘Mrs. Q’: William Blake, William Benbow, and the Context of Regency Radicalism,” <hi rend="i">ibid</hi>, 169-84.</note></p>
            <p>Another essay which is likely to draw attention is that by Christopher Hobson in which he argues that the often-cited “Orc cycle” is a myth in the pejorative sense rather than in the sense of Northrop Frye.<ref target="n8" type="note">8</ref><note id="n8"><hi rend="s">8</hi> Christopher Z. Hobson, “The Myth of Blake’s ‘Orc Cycle,’” <hi rend="i">ibid</hi>, 5-36.</note></p>
            <p>The most densely argued essay recorded here, and probably the one which will prove most lastingly influential, is that by Joseph Viscomi about the genesis of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, the second-to-be-published section of a three-part study of the <hi rend="i">Marriage.</hi> In particular, he assembles very persuasive evidence that pl. 21-24 of the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> formed “an autonomous text preceding the composition of . . .

            <p>Two books were reprinted in 1998 with no new matter: Alexander Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi> (1863), ed. W. Graham Robertson (1907) and G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">William Blake:</hi> The Critical Heritage (1975).</p>

As with all such psychological interpretations, one wonders where the author’s alienation ends and that of the subject begins.</p>
            <p>Henry Summerfield, <hi rend="i">A Guide to the Books of William Blake for Innocent and Experienced Readers</hi> (1998), is a useful and enormous (874-page) digest of Blake scholarship and criticism, a kind of variorum edition of Blake which omits the texts themselves.</p>
            <pb id="p32-117" n="117"/>
            <p>Nicholas M. Williams, <hi rend="i">Ideology and Utopia in the Poetry of William Blake</hi> (1998), is greatly concerned with critical theory and with “readings” of Blake’s writings, particularly concerning Blake’s “program for social change” (xiv).</p>
            <p>Wayne Glausser, <hi rend="i">Locke and Blake:</hi> A Conversation across the Eighteenth Century (1998) is a remarkable exercise in discovering affinities between two men who are usually treated as polar opposites.

            <p>The most important of the books on Blake published in 1998 are those by Stanley Gardner, John Pierce, and Fred Dortort.</p>
            <p>Certainly the most challenging, and perhaps the one which will prove over the years to be the most rewarding, is Fred Dortort, <hi rend="i">The Dialectic of Vision:</hi> A Contrary Reading of William Blake’s <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (1998). The book appropriates, adapts, and extends the terms and methods of Donald Ault’s challenging <hi rend="i">Narrative Unbound:</hi> Re-Visioning William Blake’s <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> (1987), which alone will be enough to frighten off all but the most dauntless readers. But dauntlessness will be rewarded. Dortort posits two warring meanings in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, one of radical English Christianity and the other exposing and correcting the oppression of the former. These two elements are not so much cunning authorial devices to enmesh the reader as manifestations of internal conflicts in Blake himself. Readers who struggle through the extraordinarily dense and self-reflexive argument are likely to conclude that Dortort has made a far stronger case than they expected when beginning the book.</p>
            <p>John B. Pierce, <hi rend="i">Flexible Design:</hi> Revisionary Poetics in Blake’s <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> or <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> (1998) has surprising affinities to Dortort’s work on <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> but is far more accessible. The chief difference is probably Pierce’s emphasis upon the deliberateness of Blake’s shifting narrative strategies; Blake uses “conscious adaptations of sequential disruptions as a fundamental element in narrative experiment” (xxii). Pierce pays very careful attention to the physical characteristics of the manuscript, and he makes a plausible case that “the synoptic and synchronic tendencies of Blake’s poetics are the result of conscious revision and correction of an essentially diachronic narrative” (xvii-xviii). This is a valuable study of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, and its arguments about narrative method and intention have important implications for each of Blake’s long Prophecies, particularly for <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi></p>
            <p>The book which is likely to be most frequently read is the late Stanley Gardner’s <hi rend="i">The Tyger, the Lamb, and the Terrible Desart: Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> in its times and circumstance (1998). In the first place, the book is beautiful, with color reproductions of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copies I and b, the former watercolored, the latter posthumously-printed and in monochrome. In the second place, it deals in a straight-forward way with Blake’s most widely appealing poems. And in the third place it provides generous and often very original evidence that the <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> are vitally related to the reforms concerning destitute and orphan children established and then dismantled in Blake’s own very enlightened parish of St. James, Westminster. The infants in the poems are often foundlings, the caring women are parish nurses, not mothers, and the village scenes are often in Wimbledon where the St. James Parish authorities for a time sent the charity-supported children to get them out of the literally-deadly poor-houses when they were very young. Stanley Gardner’s <hi rend="i">The Tyger, the Lamb, and the Terrible Desart</hi> is a visual, critical, and scholarly delight.</p>

            </head>
            <p>Some of the roads not taken in recent scholarship are wonderfully alluring. Jon Mee argues that Blake’s poem from <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> called “The Sick Rose” alludes to the powerful and powerfully corrupt politician George Rose, a secretary of the Treasury, who was convicted in 1791 of having paid “bludgeon men” to persuade unconvinced voters to support the government in the 1788 Westminster election.<ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref> Mee marshalls the historical and political facts with wonderfully tempting skill. The problem is that neither “The Sick Rose” nor any of the other poems in <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> feel like personal caricatures or political diatribes. Blake’s art and poetry work in fundamentally different ways from those of Cruikshank and Gillray. <note id="n14"><hi rend="s">14</hi> Jon Mee, “The ‘insidious poison of secret Influence’: A New Historical Context for Blake’s ‘The Sick Rose,’” <hi rend="i">Studies in the Eighteenth Century 10</hi> 22 (1998): 111-22.</note></p>
            <p>Others make claims which seem to have little to do with the poet William Blake. There is no reason known to me to believe that William Blake was any more “a disenfrancised citizen”<ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref> than were his brothers James and John, his father James, and his partner James Parker, and one or more of them voted in the elections of 1749, 1774, 1780, 1784, 1788, and 1790,<ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref> though the poet chose not to do so. And the attempt to associate Blake with the fraternity and symbols of the Masons is often supported by evidence no more persuasive than that “‘James Blake’ appears (with other shopkeepers and artisans) on an Ancient lodge register in 1757”<ref target="n17" type="note">17</ref><pb id="p32-118" n="118"/>

The headpiece, of children playing “under the oak” round which sit “the old folk” is related sufficiently closely to the headpiece of the <hi rend="i">Pictorial Calendar</hi>, with children dancing round a huge oak tree, to make one wonder whether the designer had seen Blake’s plate.<lb/>
                                                
An even closer analogy in <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> to the <hi rend="i">Pictorial Calendar</hi> head-piece of dancing on the green is in the tailpiece for “Nurse’s Song” (illus. 3c).<lb/>
                                                
Blake’s tailpiece of children walking homeward (illus. 3b) is quite unlike the <hi rend="i">Pictorial Calendar</hi> tailpiece of handkerchief dancing in a village street (illus. 2b).</figDesc></figure>

                <p>On the publication in June 1805 of Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (1805), Blake became liable for his share (c. £23<ref target="n37" type="note">37</ref>) of the publication costs, and, though he expected to receive half the proceeds from the sales,<ref target="n38" type="note">38</ref> this was slow in coming in and probably never equalled his investment in cash and kind. To pay his debt to Phillips, Blake may have had to borrow money, and the sacrifices he had to make to repay his debt may well have reduced him to living on a pittance. Perhaps after all Cromek was right that in the autumn of 1805 the Blakes “were reduced so low as to be obliged to live on half-a-guinea a week!” <note id="n37"><hi rend="s">37</hi> Blake’s share was half the total publication cost (£256.0.7) minus the £105 credit for his engravings.</note><note id="n38"><hi rend="s">38</hi> The price given in the <hi rend="i">Eclectic Review</hi> 1 (1805): 923, was 10<hi rend="i">s</hi> 6<hi rend="i">d.</hi> (Phillips’ <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi> [1805]: 583, must be in error in giving the price as 6<hi rend="i">s.</hi>) Of this 10<hi rend="i">s</hi> 6<hi rend="i">d</hi>, the bookseller’s discount was 16 2/3% (1<hi rend="i">s</hi> 9<hi rend="i">d</hi>), leaving 8<hi rend="i">s</hi> 9<hi rend="i">d</hi> for the publishers.

                <p>We can only guess how many copies of Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (1805) were sold—probably not many. Had the number been large, Phillips would surely have published another edition.</p>

                <p>In order to make a profit, 564 copies of the <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> had to be sold, and almost certainly the total sales were fewer than this.</p>

                <p>It seems very likely that Blake received no profit from the sales of the <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>, though he did receive credit for £105 for his engravings—from which, of course, he had to deduct the 10s for the copper.</p>
                <p>Hayley, William, <hi rend="i">Designs to A Series of Ballads</hi> (1802) We do not know how many copies of the <hi rend="i">Designs</hi> were printed or what Seagrave’s charges were for printing and paper, but we may make estimates based upon Blake’s statement that he paid Seagrave £30<ref target="n40" type="note">40</ref> and on contemporary printing prices. On 10 October 1800 Thomas Bensley estimated that the cost of printing 1,000 quarto copies of Thomson’s <hi rend="i">Seasons</hi> (5 sheets) for F.J. Du Roveray would be £15.15.0 per sheet (£78.15) for paper, printing, and hotpressing.<ref target="n41" type="note">41</ref><note id="n40"><hi rend="s">40</hi> On 28 December 1804 Blake thanked Hayley for “the Twelve Guineas which you Lent Me when I made up 30 Pounds to pay our Worthy Seagrave in part of his Accounts” (<hi rend="i">William Blake’s Writings</hi> [1978] 1619). I take the “part” of Seagrave’s account to be £12.12.0 rather than the £30. Hayley said Blake had “paid a Bill of 30£ for paper” (letter of 3 April 1803 [<hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> [1969] 114) which I take to represent payment to Seagrave for paper <hi rend="i">and printing of the Designs.</hi><p>When Blake wrote on 11 Dec 1805 that he “should be able to Settle with him [<hi rend="i">Seagrave</hi>] Soon what is between us” (<hi rend="i">William Blake’s Writings</hi> 1631), he was presumably referring to his indebtedness not for the <hi rend="i">Designs</hi> (1802) but for the <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (1805), for which the publisher Richard Phillips “will go equal shares with me in the expense and the profits, and . . . Seagrave is to be the printer” (letter of 22 Jan 1805 [<hi rend="i">William Blake’s Writings</hi> 1631]).</p></note><note id="n41"><hi rend="s">41</hi> Quoted from the MS in the Huntington Library; see G. E. Bentley, Jr., “F.J. Du Roveray, Illustrated-Book Publisher 1798-1806: The Amateur and the Trade,” <hi rend="i">Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin</hi> 12 (1988): 70.</note></p>
                <p>At this rate, £29.10.8 would pay for 250 quarto copies of the 7½ sheets of Hayley’s first four Ballads. Assuming that Seagrave’s provincial rates were lower than those of the metropolitan fine printer Bensley, and that Seagrave did not hotpress the <hi rend="i">Designs</hi>, his charges for 250 copies would have been somewhat lower than £29.10.8. On the other hand, the paper on which Blake printed the whole-page plates (the same as for the text, watermarked “1802”) are not included in this cost. The 312½ sheets for the five whole-page engravings at £5 per ream of 500 sheets would have come to about £3 more.</p>
                <pb id="p32-126" n="126"/>
                <p>Presumably Seagrave printed 250 copies of each Ballad and sent them to Blake; Blake and his wife then printed three designs on text plates plus a frontispiece and a separate print for each Ballad—but they printed them only as the need arose, not all at once. When there proved to be demand for no more than a few score copies (only 12 copies of the first Ballad have been traced in public collections), Blake was left with perhaps 200 copies (1500 sheets) of the <hi rend="i">Designs.</hi> These were of no commercial value, but the paper alone had cost about £15. Blake cannily kept these sheets, even taking them back to London with him in 1803, at considerable trouble, and he drew on them for the rest of his life, including designs for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> (1805), Malkin’s <hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi> (1806), Job and Dante (c. 1824).</p>

                <p>Blake said that
<q>
My Wife has undertaken to Print the whole number of the Plates for [<hi rend="i">the first two volumes of</hi>] Cowpers work which She does to admiration &amp; being under my own eye the prints are as fine as the French prints &amp; please every one. . . . The Publishers are already indebted to My Wife Twenty Guineas for work deliverd [<hi rend="i">letter of 30 January 1803.</hi>]
</q></p>
                <p>However, after the Blakes had printed 12 proof sets of the two plates for Vol. 3 of <hi rend="i">Cowper</hi>, Blake had to “send the Plates to [<hi rend="i">Joseph</hi>] Johnson who wants them to set the Printer to work upon” (letter of 31 March 1804). R. N. Essick remarks that
<q>
The plates for vols. 1-2 are much more clearly and darkly printed in the second edition .... One hesitates to blame Mrs Blake for the poor impressions of the first states, but that may indeed be the case [<hi rend="i">William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations (1991)</hi>].

                <p>Nothing at all is known of the other six finished designs for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> which Cromek bought from Blake.<ref target="n44" type="note">44</ref><note id="n44"><hi rend="s">44</hi> However, there are preliminary sketches for all but pl. 2, 8, 10, 12, plus four alternative versions of the title page.</note></p>
                <p>No surviving drawing or book by Blake has been traced to the collection of Cromek or Sivright.</p>
                <p>However, Allan Cunningham evidently saw the design described in the first 1805 Prospectus as “Death Pursuing the Soul through the Avenues of Life.”<ref target="n45" type="note">45</ref> Cunningham had good opportunity to see Cromek’s watercolors for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>, for he lived with Cromek when he first came to London in 1810, and Cromek’s son later lent him Cromek’s copy of his letter to Blake of May 1807 (q.v.). Apparently the designs for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> were still in the Cromek family as late as 1830 and passed thereafter to Thomas Sivright of Meggetland. <note id="n45"><hi rend="s">45</hi> Cunningham (1830) paragraph 21 (<hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> 487), a reference generously pointed out to me by Essick. However, Cunningham thought the drawing an illustration for <hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen</hi>; one of Urizen’s “exploits is to chase a female soul through a narrow gate and hurl her headlong down into a darksome pit.” No such action is described or depicted in <hi rend="i">Urizen.</hi></note></p>

                <p>Additional information about R. C. Jackson’s Blake collection is given in Thomas Wright, <hi rend="i">The Life of Walter Pater</hi> (N.Y.: G. P. Putnam’s Sens’ London: Everett &amp; Co., 1907); Vol. 2 is largely based on information from R. C. Jackson, information which subsequent Pater scholars have controverted<ref target="n46" type="note">46</ref> or, more commonly, ignored. For instance, Wright claimed that Jackson is the original of Pater’s <hi rend="i">Marius the Epicurean</hi> and that Pater “spent far more of his time in the company of Mr. Jackson than in that of any other friend” (21, 42). <note id="n46"><hi rend="s">46</hi> For example, Jackson is a “bizarre halluciné” whose “témoigne est . . . profondément suspect à nos yeux” (Germaine d’Hangest, <hi rend="i">Walter Pater:</hi> L’Homme et l’Œuvre [Paris: Didier, 1961] 287); Jackson “never seems to have realised the boundary between the world of his dreams and the realities of his situation,” and none of Pater’s known friends had apparently heard of Jackson (Samuel Wright, “Richard Charles Jackson,” <hi rend="i">Antigonish Review</hi> 1 [1971]: 82, 86). There is no reference to Jackson in the indices to Samuel Wright, <hi rend="i">An Informative Index to the Writings of Walter Pater</hi> (West Cornwall, Connecticut: Locust Hill Press, 1987), or in <hi rend="i">Letters of Walter Pater</hi>, ed. Lawrence Evans (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1970).</note></p>
                <p>On the other hand, Wright does present some hard evidence in the form of photographs representing Jackson c. 1882 (as “Brother a Becket”), c. 1886 (as “Marius the Epicurean”), c. 1890, and August 1906 (“in Mr. Wright’s study at Olney”) (53, 78, 172, 233) as well as Jackson’s richly cluttered rooms in Camberwell (181, 185, 189, though with no table like the one owned by Gainsborough and Blake).</p>
                <p>Jackson’s library may not have been, as Wright claimed, “one of the most valuable private libraries in England,”<ref target="n47" type="note">47</ref> but it was sufficiently extensive to allow Jackson to give 850 books on Dante to Southwark Public Library in 1900,<ref target="n48" type="note">48</ref> and Wright’s book reproduces from it photographs of (1) Virgil, Sebastian Brandt’s edition, commentary by Christophoro Landino (Argent: Johannis Gruninger, 1502) (255, 258, 261), (2) Homer (Venice, 1525) with over 100 woodcuts (265, 269, 273, 276), (3) Dante, <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy</hi> (Venice, 1529) (248), (4) <hi rend="i">The Workes of our Antient and learned English Poet Geoffrey Chaucer</hi> (London: Bonham Norton, 1598) (237, 241, 245), and (5) John Guillim, <hi rend="i">Display of Heraldry</hi>, Fourth Edition (London: Richard Bleme, 1660) with “every coat . . . properly colored at the time of publication” (268). Wright

also refers to “an early edition of Caxton and a pre-Caxtonian copy of the Golden Legend, with beautiful binding and clasps” and “first editions of Carlyle and Blake” (174). <note id="n47"><hi rend="s">47</hi> Thomas Wright 81.</note><note id="n48"><hi rend="s">48</hi> Samuel Wright, “Richard Charles Jackson,” <hi rend="i">Antigonish Review</hi> 1 (1971): 87.</note></p>
                <p>In particular, the “Blake treasures” which Jackson showed to Pater consisted of
<q>
an engraving of the Canterbury Pilgrims, Blake’s original oil-colour sketch for Chaucer, several copies of Blake’s works in proof state, including the plates to the <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi>, Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, and Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>—all in uncut states, and a copy of the famous ‘Marriage of Heaven and Hell,’ coloured in water-colours by Blake’s own hand.<ref target="n49" type="note">49</ref><note id="n49"><hi rend="s">49</hi> Wright 180. Wright does not mention a number of works associated with Blake in the 1923 catalogue: portraits of Dante and Chaucer (#182), a pen-and-ink drawing (#245), a “letter from Blake to Flaxman” (#293), Blake’s chair (#465), his painting table (#579f), and 37 volumes from “The Library of William Blake” (#812)—perhaps Jackson acquired these after Pater’s death in 1894 or after Wright’s book was published in 1907.</note></q></p>
                <p>Of these works by Blake, the only one which appears in the 1923 sale is the engraving of the Canterbury Pilgrims (#293, not attributed to Blake)—perhaps the others had been.</p>
                <p>Published “Proofs” of Job (1826) and Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> (1808) are not uncommon, but no other copy of Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> (1797) is known to be “in proof state.” “Blake’s original oil-colour sketch for Chaucer” which Wright says Jackson owned is not otherwise known.<ref target="n50" type="note">50</ref> Of the eight known colored copies of the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi>, copies F-I could not have belonged to Jackson, and it is exceedingly unlikely that A, C-E did. <note id="n50"><hi rend="s">50</hi> Blake’s tempera for the Canterbury Pilgrims has been in the Stirling-Maxwell family since 1853 (Martin Butlin, <hi rend="i">The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</hi> (New Haven &amp; London: Yale University Press, 1981) 475), and the uncolored pencil sketch has been in the Cunliffe family since 1895 (476). It is exceedingly unlikely that Blake ever made a sketch for Chaucer <hi rend="i">in oil</hi>, as opposed, say, to watercolors.</note></p>
                <p>Almost certainly Jackson did not own a proof copy of Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> (1797), “Blake’s original oil-colour sketch for Chaucer,” or a copy of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, though he could have had the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> facsimile of Hotten (1868) or of Muir (1884).</p>

                <p>Collection:: <hi rend="i">Untraced.</hi></p>
                <p>Description: The novel, set in the island of Sophis in central Africa, concerns a Utopian community embodying the best qualities of classical Greece but with radically liberated sexual customs. Cumberland gave copies to his friends, but one of them warned him that, as Cumberland reported, it would be “dangerous under Mr Pitts’ maladministration, to publish it,” and therefore “it was never published or a single copy sold to any one.” Only six copies are known, in Australian National University, Bodley (corrected), Bristol Central Library (corrected), British Library, John Rylands Library of the University of Manchester (corrected), and Yale (see G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">A Bibliography of George Cumberland</hi> [1975], 20-23).</p>
                <p>Blake almost certainly received one of the gift copies, for on 1 September 1800 he wrote to Cumberland: “Your Vision of the Happy Sophis I have devourd. O most delicious book.”</p>

[<hi rend="i">concerning</hi>] the Erection of National Galleries for the Reception of Castes in Plaster from all the Beautiful Antique Statues Basso Relievos &amp;c that can be procured” (quoted in his letter to Cumberland of 1 September 1800).</p>

                <p>The signature of “W<hi rend="s">m</hi> Blake” in old brown ink at the top of each quarto volume (see illus. 4) is similar to that of the poet but is almost certainly that of one of the score or more of contemporaries who bore his names, presumably one of the “propriétaires de terres” or cultivateurs” to whom the book is addressed. The volume has been at Yale since at least 1941.</p>

          <q>
Invigilating my last Blake exam<lb/>
alone with a blonde leggy Swedish girl<lb/>
wearing jeans and a modish black sweater<lb/>
who has been granted permission to begin early<lb/>
in five hours she’ll be flying home for Christmas<lb/>
(we both have the sniffles).<lb/><lb/>
A crepuscular calm has descended over the campus—<lb/>
over the virgin snowfall, the darkening winter greenery,<lb/>
and the androgynous clock tower<lb/>
whose carillon even now begins playing, softly—<lb/>
then abruptly ceases.<lb/><lb/>
One of the window panes begins vibrating violently<lb/>
without breeze or other apparent cause (a minor earth tremor?)<lb/><lb/>
The last time this happened—four, five years ago, same room—<lb/>
another of my students (a Blake scholar’s son)<lb/>
wordlessly opened his briefcase,<lb/>
removed a roll of masking tape and scissors,<lb/>
cut off a piece and pasted it over<lb/>
a corner of the window—thus stopping the vibration—<lb/>
then resumed writing his exam (applause).<lb/><lb/>
I mention this to the Swedish girl<lb/>
who is probably thinking of glogg and Golgonooza<lb/>
and (being a man without masking tape)<lb/>
try opening a louver, which somehow does the trick . . .<lb/><lb/>
Now the others swarm in with back packs, water bottles, pens—<lb/>
all save one, who was assaulted at knifepoint<lb/>
and limped into class the next day (aegrotat)—<lb/><lb/>
altogether armed with the knowledge<lb/>
that it is dangerous to read Blake<lb/>
and more dangerous not to.

          <p>In the winter issue of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, the caption for illus. 5 of Eugenie Freed’s “‘In the Darkness of Philisthea’: The Design of Plate 78 of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>” should have included the following information: Illustration from Hans von Gerssdorff, Feldtbůch der Wundartzney: Strassburg: Joannẽ Schott, 1517; Tractat iii.

          <p>On page 70, please note a few corrections to the quotations in German. In the quotation of the first couplet, na should be nã, güt should be gůt, and rut should be růt. In the second couplet, und should be uñ, blonen should be blonẽ, and lyde should be lydt. On page 67, note 21, blonen should again be blonẽ.</p>

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>Convenor: Michael Phillips</p>
          <p>“The Centre for Eighteenth Century Studies, in the historic King’s Manor in the city of York, is offering this new oneyear MA program featuring a core course on William Blake which also incorporates an introduction to the major archives in Great Britain for primary research in the eighteenth century. A wide selection of optional courses in the long eighteenth century is also offered to supplement this new MA. The program is also available over two years to parttime students.</p>
          <p>“Blake is the central figure of the core course, as poet, painter and printmaker and as publisher of his own works. In this regard emphasis is upon the immediate cultural and historical circumstances that affected the creation and publication of his works. This includes study of the response in Britain to the French Revolution and its aftermath, especially the era of the anti-Jacobin Terror and the crisis it occasioned in the history of civil liberty.</p>
          <p>“A feature of this new MA is its introduction to the principal archives in Britain for original research in the eighteenth century including collections of Blake and his contemporaries. Time will also be spent in a printmaking studio to see and practice first hand how Blake’s works were produced.</p>
          <p>“For a brochure and full descriptions of the Centre’s MA and doctoral programs, write or email Clare Bond at The Centre for Eighteenth Century Studies, University of York, The King’s Manor, York Y01 7EP, England; email cecsl.york.ac.uk. Our website, http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/cecs gives full details about the course, the University and the city of York.”</p>

        <p>Paul Mellon became interested in collecting William Blake at the comparatively early date of 1941. Of the major eighteenth-century British artists, George Stubbs alone preceded (and to the very end superseded) the poet in his affections. The largest exhibition of Blake’s work ever organized in North America had just closed at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and had done much to generate enthusiasm among a new generation of collectors. His first purchase was an album of 22 watercolor illustrations for the Book of Job, most frequently referred to in the literature as “The New Zealand Set” and no longer accepted as autograph. It was an inauspicious start, but a more significant and, ultimately, precursory acquisition of the same year was copy B of Blake’s first illuminated book, <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi>, from the heirs of William A. White. From this celebrated source would eventually derive <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> (copy G), <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> (copy I), and <hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi> (copy M).</p>
        <p>After 1941, hardly a year passed without Paul Mellon’s acquiring some Blake opus. The harvest is impressive: four tempera paintings, one monotype, several hundred prints and watercolors, and several dozen volumes with engraved illustrations; however, it is the 12 illuminated books that truly elevated him to preeminence among Blake admirers. Between 1947 and 1949, the acquisitions included Philip Hofer’s <hi rend="i">Book of Thel</hi> (copy B); Benjamin D’Israeli’s <hi rend="i">Europe a Prophecy</hi> (copy A); the <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> and <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> (copy F) that George Cumberland, Blake’s generous patron, had bound together in 1794; and a complete <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> (copy L) that has no known marvelous pedigree despite its quiet excellence. In the 1950s, the three previously cited titles from the White collection were added, as were a second <hi rend="i">Book of Thel</hi> (copy R) and one of the few copies of <hi rend="i">The [First] Book of Urizen</hi> (copy A) with a full complement of 28 plates. The final illuminated book to enter the collection, in 1972, was a second copy, quite differently colored, of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (copy C), thus bringing together two of only eight known printings of that magnificent prophetic work.</p>
        <p>When Paul Mellon began to amass a comprehensive collection of British art in the 1960’s, he was plunging into a field that was much undervalued internationally. Conversely, 20 years earlier, he had been anticipated in his passion for Blake by a very acquisitive group of distinguished bibliophiles that included Henry E. Huntington, Lessing J. Rosenwald, and Mrs. Landon K. Thorne in America, and W. Graham Robertson and Sir Geoffrey Keynes in England. Exceptional objects were rare and the competition was aggressive. The Mellon collection could never achieve, at that date, the comprehensiveness of those other collections, but it ultimately ranks with them primarily because of two stellar acquisitions: the 116 watercolor illustrations for the poems of Thomas Gray, and the most coveted of Blake’s composite art of poetry, painting, and printmaking, the unique colored copy of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (copy E).<gap type="emend"/></p>
        <pb id="p32-151" n="151"/>
        <p>Paul Mellon purchased <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> in 1953 from the collection formed by Sir William Stirling-Maxwell. From the same source and in the same year, he acquired, and immediately donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum, the tempera of <hi rend="i">The Virgin and Child in Egypt</hi> (1810). This was not his first Blake donation to a public institution. In 1949 he and Mrs. Thorne had made possible the purchase by the Morgan Library of twelve watercolor illustrations for Milton’s <hi rend="i">L’Allegro</hi> and <hi rend="i">Il Penseroso.</hi> The illustrations to Gray were purchased in 1966 by private treaty, thus preventing their likely dispersal by the trade.</p>
        <p>Prior to that date, in March 1949, Geoffrey Keynes and others had founded the William Blake Trust to promote the continued study of the poet through the publication of accurate color reproductions of his greatest works. The unique copy E of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, which had not yet entered the Mellon collection, was the first major project undertaken for the Trust by Arnold Fawcus and his Trianon Press in Paris. In 1962, Paul Mellon was elected an Associate American Trustee, and from 1966 to 1970 he supported financially, and with matchless patience, the exacting production of the jewel of the Trust’s collotype and stencil replications, <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Water-Colour Designs for the Poems of Thomas Gray</hi> (1971). This was merely one of many instances of his financial and intellectual support for the publications and exhibitions of the Blake Trust. It is quite likely, in fact, that without his subventions the Trust would not have been able to effect its most important projects. Martin Butlin’s magnificent catalogue raisonné, to cite but one example, owes its second, invaluable volume of illustrations to Paul Mellon’s generosity.</p>
        <p>As a novice curator only recently arrived at the British Art Center after its opening in 1977, I was immediately dispatched to Upperville to reconnoiter what remained of the British paintings and drawings not yet transferred to Yale. The Brick House was still resplendent with its dazzling collection of Ben Marshall and Stubbs set on pastel walls. The Degas waxes and <hi rend="i">Fallen Jockey</hi> seemed an exquisite anomaly in this seat of Georgian decorum. The Degas <hi rend="i">Self-Portrait</hi>, literally affixed to a nearby powder room door, playfully exposed the unique wit of a man who was fastidious about the installation of his collection. The majestic library, however, had had its shelves seriously denuded of its many treasures—the color-plate books that comprised the Abbey collection, for instance. I first met Paul Mellon in this library. It was the briefest of encounters. He had come to assess and to welcome, but he made the point of introducing me to a very special group of books and folios that occupied an inconspicuous nine square feet of this cavernous cabinetry. On the nearby tables rare sixteenth-century globes, flawless porcelain, and the trophies and bronzes of Mill Reef proved little distraction as he pulled a volume from the shelf and left me to my private meditations. It was <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, plates 1-20.</p>
        <p>Although much of the Blake material had gone to Yale in 1977, Paul Mellon retained the cream of the collection, for obvious personal reasons, until its permanent transfer to the British Art Center in 1992. At his death, he owned only a single work by Blake. Identical in size to the small engraved illustration for Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (1805) that it reproduces, <hi rend="i">The Horse</hi>, a precious tempera on copper, is indisputably the gem of the entire collection. If it is one of the “little high finished Pictures the size the Engravings are to be” mentioned by Blake in a letter to Hayley of March 1805, it is the only surviving example. Intimate in scale, exquisite in execution, perfection in its state of preservation, and thematically so sympathetic to the varied tastes of a literary scholar, connoisseur, and sportsman, it is not surprising that this philanthropist, who gladly relinquished to the public domain countless works of art in his lifetime, was reluctant to do so in this one instance.</p>
        <p>In 1997, I organized an exhibition of the entire Mellon Blake collection. Many of the works had been seen publicly over the years in the most important Blake exhibitions, especially those organized by Martin Butlin for the Tate in 1978 and David Bindman for Yale in 1984, but never had they all been shown together. While still in his possession, Paul Mellon had had the illuminated books and the Gray disbound with the thought of their public exhibtion and ease of study in mind. Consequently, it was possible to exhibit for the first time all one hundred plates of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and to juxtapose the multiple sets of <hi rend="i">Songs, Thel</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Urizen.</hi> A staggering display of over 350 sheets, the exhibition paid admirable tribute to Paul Mellon on his ninetieth birthday and to his lifelong commitment to Blake. He spent hours in the show, on several visits, carefully examining the many works with which he had communed privately over the years. His enthusiasm for Blake was unflagging, and at the end of one of our campaigns he asked, in a capriciously plaintive voice, whatever possessed him to part with such treasures.</p>
        <p>Paul Mellon was a magnificent collector, not only of Blake but of artists of many nationalities and epochs. He was blessed with a cultivated and incisive taste for objects of both transcendent and private import; hence the intoxicating appeal of a poet who made an art of the book. He entered the game rather late yet he garnered many of the finest trophies, and until one has enjoyed these treasures in the serene atmosphere of Louis Kahn’s building at Yale, it is impossible to grasp the special order of Paul Mellon’s genius and philanthropy, and the magnitude of our loss.</p>
