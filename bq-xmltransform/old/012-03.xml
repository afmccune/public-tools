                <p>A female figure driving a serpent-team through the treetops appears in both
                    versions of Blake’s watercolor designs for Milton’s <hi rend="i">Comus</hi>, Scene 4—the earlier series now in the
                    Huntington Library (cited below as H) and the later series in the Museum of Fine
                    Arts, Boston (B).<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> Despite striking
                    differences between the two sets,<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> and
                    specifically between the two female figures in this scene, between their
                    serpent-teams, and the darkness of the night, commentators almost never consider
                    both versions when discussing Blake’s visual interpretations of the
                    masque. As a consequence, they generally regard the two females as the same
                    character. Irene Tayler, taking into account only the H series in her pioneering
                    essay on the designs, refers to the "draped female overhead"
                    as "the strange dragon or snake-lady," "that veiled
                    tyrant of women" whom Blake might intend to suggest "the
                    moon-goddess Cynthia" or maybe Medea.<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> Commenting on the B series only, Marcia R. Pointon calls the woman
                    above the trees "Diana, goddess of the moon" (p. 139). More
                    recently, Joseph A. Wittreich, Jr. labels the females Blake’s
                    personification of Jealousy,<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> and Stephen C.
                    Behrendt follows Pointon in calling the figures Cynthia-Diana.<ref target="n5" type="note">5</ref>
                    <note id="n1">
                        <hi rend="s">1</hi> The two series, although of the same scenes or
                        combination of scenes in <hi rend="i">Comus</hi>, are considerably different
                        (see n. 2 below). The date of the Huntington set of eight is probably about
                        1801-1802, as Blake refers to the unfinished designs in a letter to John
                        Flaxman dated 19 October 1801 (Blake, <hi rend="i">Complete Writings</hi>,
                        ed. Geoffrey Keynes [London: Oxford Univ. Press, 1966], p. 810). The date of
                        the Boston series of eight is less certain. Marcia R. Pointon suggests that
                        they were done "probably a little later" than the first
                        set (<hi rend="i">Milton &amp; English Art</hi> [Toronto: Univ. of
                        Toronto Press, 1970], p. 139); Angus Fletcher dates them between 1805 and
                        1810 (<hi rend="i">The Transcendental Masque: An Essay on
                            Milton’s "Comus"</hi> [Ithaca, N.Y.:
                        Cornell Univ. Press, 1971], p. 253); Joseph A. Wittreich, Jr. proposes 1809
                            (<hi rend="i">Angel of Apocalypse: Blake’s Idea of
                            Milton</hi> [Madison: Univ. of Wisconsin Press, 1975], p. 80); and more
                        recently David Bindman asserts that they were done "probably about
                        1815," although he offers no evidence for so late a date (<hi rend="i">Blake As an Artist</hi> [Oxford: Phaidon, 1977], p. 186). The
                        important question of whether the B series was completed before or after
                        Blake’s <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, the date of which is also open
                        to question, thus remains unresolved. Both sets are reproduced in color by
                        A. Fletcher, but the H series in the copies of Fletcher I have seen is badly
                        printed and potentially misleading. Having examined the originals of both
                        sets, I am impressed that a quality reproduction of them in color is sorely
                        needed. For kind permission to reproduce these two sets of designs, I wish
                        to thank the Huntington Library and Art Gallery, San Marino, Calif., and the
                        Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.</note>

                </p>
                <p>Compounding this confusion concerning the figures is the repeated assertion that
                    they cannot be found in the standard versions of <hi rend="i">Comus</hi> at all,
                    but are Blake’s invention.<ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref>
                    Wittreich cites as Blake’s source for these figures several lines
                    about a dragon that were cancelled in the Trinity (College) Manuscript of the
                    masque, but first published in 1798 and thus available to Blake. Certain details
                    of Wittreich’s argument are persuasive, but his fundamental assertion
                    that the cancelled lines constitute Blake’s primary source for the
                    serpentteams and the female figures is essentially unconvincing.<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> These figures, to the contrary, are identified in the
                    standard published texts of <hi rend="i">Comus</hi> in circulation during
                    Blake’s day.<ref target="n8" type="note">8</ref> In addition, a
                    matching of text and design reveals that Blake’s females in this
                    scene, one in each version, are not variations of the same person, but are two
                    different persons.<ref target="n9" type="note">9</ref>

                        First!" p. 237); Pointon, "Above the trees rides the
                        moon-goddess . . . a figure which does not feature in Milton’s
                        poem" (p. 139), even though Blake is "precise in following
                        details of the text" (p. 138); Behrendt, "The figure in
                        the dragon-car above the trees is unmentioned in Milton’s

                        <hi rend="s">7</hi> The heart of Wittreich’s argument
                        is as follows: "Charles Lamb reminds us that the following lines,
                        ‘not printed in the common editions of Milton’ and not
                        ‘generally known to belong to that divine
                        "Masque",’ were printed in both the 1801 and
                        1809 editions by Henry John Todd, having first been published in
                        Todd’s 1798 edition of <hi rend="i">Comus.</hi> The Attendant
                        Spirit, descending and entering, explains that his mansion is <hi rend="i">‘Amidst th’ Hesperian gardens . . . / . . . on
                            whose faire tree / The scalie-harnest dragon ever keeps / His
                            uninchanted eye.’</hi> A few lines later we read of the
                        ‘jealous ocean’ winding his ‘farre extended
                        armes, till with steepe fall / Halfe his wast flood the wild Atlantique
                        fills.’ The scaly dragon derives from these lines, and so does
                        the figure of jealousy, which is transformed by Blake into the
                        ‘female’ riding the dragon. The arching trees,
                        creating a den-like place, may also be explained by turning to the cancelled
                        lines that speak of ‘this <hi rend="i">arched</hi>
                        wood’ and its ‘<hi rend="i">yawning
                        dens</hi>’" (<hi rend="i">Angel of Apocalypse</hi>, pp.
                        82-83). That the single dragon in the cancelled lines is
                        "scalie," "harnest," and that the trees
                        of the forest are "arched" and form "yawning
                        dens" coincide with elements in Blake’s
                        illustrations—the H serpents (but not the B) are scaled, in both
                        series they are harnessed, and the trees are noticeably arched, particularly
                        in H. But Blake’s dragons are a team, they are not keeping watch
                        over precious fruit, and they are driven by female figures (not male, like
                        Milton’s Jealous Ocean) who ostensibly have no direct connection
                        with the Attendant Spirit or with the Hesperian Gardens from whence he
                        comes. The cancelled lines are discussed by John. S. Diekhoff, who points
                        out that the central images in this cancelled passage (the Hesperian tree,
                        the dragon guarding the fruit with "uninchanted eye") are
                        inserted by Milton further on in the masque and thus appear in all standard
                        versions, including those Blake most likely used ("The Text of <hi rend="i">Comus</hi>, 1634 to 1645" [1937; rpt. as an appendix

                            evidence that he followed an adaptation over the standard texts. The
                            first major adaptation, that of John Dalton in 1738, adds scenes,
                            shortens speeches, and inserts additional characters: a second attendant
                            spirit, Philidel, is to watch over the Lady in the forest; Euphrosyne
                            adds to Comus’s argument at the castle; and a spirit assists
                            Sabrina late in the masque (<hi rend="i">Comus, a Mask . . . As

                            Milton’s Attendant Spirit (so identified because he holds the
                            magic herb, as he later tells the brothers, 638-47). H 5 and B 5 do not
                            include a female persuader. Dalton’s adaptation,
                            incidentally, does include the Cotytto-Hecate passage cited previously;
                            but its successor, that by George Colman in 1772, shortens the passage
                            and omits all reference to Cotytto, rendering the lines nonsensical (<hi rend="i">Comus: A Masque, Altered from Milton . . .</hi> [London: T.

                <p>Blake’s fourth scenes, in which the Attendant Spirit dressed as the
                    shepherd Thyrsis shows the brothers the magic herb <hi rend="i">haemony</hi>,

                    describes much earlier in the masque the serpent-ladies that Blake places in the
                    treetops. During Comus’s initial appearance as the forest
                    enchanter-seducer, he calls upon his retinue, partially transformed into beasts,
                    to join him in a libidinous ceremony: <q> Come, let us our rights begin,<lb/>

                        (125-37) </q> Certainly this invocation to "Dark-veil’d
                    Cotytto" is Blake’s primary source for the darkly draped
                    female in H 4. This Thracian goddess of licentiousness, worshipped only on the
                    darkest (or Stygian) nights, appears in Blake’s dark scene riding
                    through a treetop gloom that obscures sky, stars, and moon.<ref target="n10" type="note">10</ref> Since Comus and his monsters begin their rites to the
                    goddess five hundred lines before Scene 4, we might be surprised by her
                    appearance here instead of in Blake’s first scene, that of Comus and
                    his revelers. But the text does not specify that she actually appears in
                    response to the invocation, probably because the chaste Lady’s
                    approach interrupts the rites at their beginning. Comus directs his rabble to
                    hide (147-48), enchants the spot (150 ff.), and entices the Lady who enters to
                    proceed with him to his cottage (244 ff.), where unknown to her he obviously
                    plans to reinitiate the rites to Cotytto. Thus Blake’s choice to
                    portray Cotytto in H 4, riding through the same forest in which she was earlier
                    invoked, is logical even though the text does not specify her presence here.
                    Seemingly she is enroute to the castle for the rites, which Blake suggests by
                    her direction toward the right margin, forward to the next scene inside the
                    castle. <note id="n10">
                        <hi rend="s">10</hi> The sky is not visible partly
                        because the woman rides through rather than above the foliage. In the B
                        series, the female rides atop the trees, the night is clear, and the sky and
                        moon are plainly visible. The gloom Blake portrays in H is consistent with
                        numerous allusions by the masque characters to the absolute darkness of the
                        night, caused by heavy clouds (e.g., 193-96; 203; 330-38; and so forth). The
                        only light to appear during these early forest scenes, according to the
                        text, is a momentary glimmer in the clouds detected by the Lady
                        (220-24).</note>

                <p>Milton alludes metaphorically to a dragon in this Cotytto-Hecate passage (131)
                    and later to a dragon guarding the Hesperian Tree in the regions whence the
                    Attendant Spirit has come (395); but Blake’s primary source for the
                    serpent-team is probably the dragon-team traditionally associated with
                    Hecate’s car (in Ovid, for instance, and mentioned elsewhere by
                        Milton<ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref>). Blake’s red and
                    blue scaled beasts in H 4 might most accurately be labeled crested snakes or
                    serpents rather than dragons, as they have no legs or wings.<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref>

                <p>Hecate, however, with whom Milton’s Cotytto rides, does not appear in
                    H 4, nor in H 1. Because Milton aligns Cotytto so closely with her, because the
                    Attendant Spirit claims that Comus frequently performs rites to her (535), and
                    because she does appear in Blake’s B series, consideration should be
                    given to Hecate’s role in Blake’s H interpretation. <pb id="p12-166" n="166"/>

                        <figDesc>Huntington at top; Boston, lower.</figDesc>
                    </figure> Surely Blake does not intend her to be hidden in the gloom beside
                    Cotytto in H 4. Does he interpret Milton’s line ("Wherein
                    thou rid’st with Hecat’") to mean that Cotytto
                    sometimes rides with Hecate, but not always? Or has he in mind the Attendant
                    Spirit’s claim to the brothers during this scene that as their
                    father’s shepherd he has often heard Comus and his revelers
                    performing rites to Hecate and hence is drawing attention to the duality of
                    nocturnal rites performed by Comus—some to Hecate as goddess of
                    witchcraft, and on the darkest nights, other rites (or additional rites) to
                    Cotytto as a goddess of lechery? If this is Blake’s intent, H 1 would
                    not represent rites to Hecate only, as a reader might presume from the Attendant
                    Spirit’s assertion, but rites either to Hecate (but preliminary to
                    Cotytto rites on this Stygian night) or rites to Cotytto, the noise of which the
                    Spirit has interpreted as Hecate rites, and over which Hecate ultimately
                    presides. But if H 1 and H 4 involve Hecate, where is she?</p>
                <p>I believe her absence from the scene can be explained satisfactorily in terms of
                    a logical presence elsewhere in the forest. Is it not reasonable to conceive of
                    Hecate being involved, not directly in H 1, but in H 2? Although she is not
                    invoked this particular night, she is Comus’s reigning deity and
                    ostensibly his ultimate source of enchanting power. So when he enchants the spot
                    that Blake depicts in H 2, as well as himself, with "dazling
                    spells" (154) and "magic dust" (165), then leads the
                    beguiled Lady from the place through the forest to his castle, might not Blake
                    have intended Hecate to preside over this spell that continues through the
                    forest trek, according to the text, until the Lady is seated inside the castle
                    in Scene 5? Though Blake does not depict Hecate visually in H 2, and though the
                    text does not specify her appearance or direct involvement, her presence in the
                    scene is logical. If H 2 is viewed in this manner, and if we consider carefully
                    the chronology of the masque, Hecate would be journeying to the castle (and the
                    rites) with Comus and the Lady at the same time Cotytto rides there in H 4.</p>
                <p>If we consider the details of Cotytto worship, we will quickly comprehend the
                    aptness of Milton’s allusion to her in <hi rend="i">Comus</hi> and
                    the aptness of Blake’s inclusion of her in H 4. A Greek goddess of
                    wantonness, Cotytto was not well known in Milton’s day or in
                    Blake’s. Milton does not mention her elsewhere, and Blake never
                    refers to her by name. Milton associates her with the better-known Hecate,
                    goddess of the underworld and witchcraft, presumably because both were said to
                    originate in Thrace. There is historical evidence of Cotytto worship in Corinth,
                    perhaps in Athens, and with great license in Rome.<ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref>
                    <pb id="p12-167" n="167"/> The longest account of Cotytto worship appears in
                    Juvenal’s Second Satire, "Moralists without
                    Morals," with which Milton was familiar (Osgood, pp. 24-25). Juvenal
                    associates the goddess with orgiastic rites conducted by priests that were
                    secret, nocturnal, torchlit, gluttonous, accompanied by dancing, and chiefly
                    sodomistic. The orgiastic elements in <hi rend="i">Comus</hi> approximate these
                    closely, with the possible exception of sodomy: Comus calls together his
                    followers in secret, at night; they carry torches; they later feast at a
                    banquet; and they "knit hands, and beat the ground / In a light
                    fantastic round" (143-44). Also similar to elements in <hi rend="i">Comus</hi> are Juvenal’s references in Cotytto worship to
                    metamorphoses (in <hi rend="i">Comus</hi>, the monsters); Stygian blackness (in
                        <hi rend="i">Comus</hi>, 132); a cup or glass used in the rites (in <hi rend="i">Comus</hi>, the crystal goblet with enchanting liquid); and the
                    initiation rite (in <hi rend="i">Comus</hi>, the drink). In view of Barbara
                    Breasted’s recent discovery that Milton wrote <hi rend="i">Comus</hi>
                    in the wake of a notorious sex scandal that included rape, incest, and sodomy
                    among relatives of the <hi rend="i">Comus</hi> Bridgewater family—and
                    the masque thus being an attempt to help re-establish the family’s
                    integrity—Cotytto’s presence in the masque is doubly
                        appropriate.<ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref> Blake probably did not
                    know of the Castlehaven Scandal, and he may not have been familiar with all the
                    details of Juvenal’s account of her, but he surely was familiar with
                    her role as a goddess of lechery, an identification provided in Thomas

                    <ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref> And he obviously detected
                    in the masque a central theme of the conflict between chastity and perversity.

                <p>Cotytto’s serpents in H 4, or more precisely Hecate’s
                    serpents, which Cotytto is driving, are typical Blake serpents: crested, mouths
                    open, tongues out, and thus active. For Blake, serpents represent (among other
                    things) hypocrisy, corrupt priesthood, and sexuality.<ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref> Indeed, one can conceive a close similarity between the
                    attempt by Comus to force the Lady into sexual experience (particularly if one
                    remembers the serpent above Comus’s wand in B 5) and the theme of
                    Blake’s "I saw a chapel all of gold": that forced
                    and undesired acts of sex are perversions of real love.<ref target="n17" type="note">17</ref> In addition, the serpent-team represents the
                    spiritualmoral warfare that constitutes the foundation of the masque:<ref target="n18" type="note">18</ref> the struggle of the brothers with each
                    other, the Lady with Comus and with herself, Comus with himself, and the
                    brothers with Comus and his monsters. We should note that these conflicts are
                    essentially dissolved, rather than overcome, by the magic herb <hi rend="i">haemony</hi> that Blake portrays in this scene.<ref target="n19" type="note">19</ref> Also worth noting is Blake’s placing of the
                    herb, held by the Spirit, almost directly below Cotytto’s triangular,
                    scale-shaped skirt.<ref target="n20" type="note">20</ref> Possibly this
                    juxtaposition of herb beneath the scale is Blake’s way of drawing
                    attention to the importance of the herb’s function in eliminating the
                    stalemates in the masque.<ref target="n21" type="note">21</ref>

                        (III. 558; cf. IV. 997). Blake may also be including the scale image in his
                        fifth <hi rend="i">Comus</hi> scenes, the Banquet: in both versions, he
                        includes hanging lamps triangular and scale-shaped, one almost directly over
                        the seated Lady. And in H 6, a lamp is visible below the second
                        brother’s sword, where it looks more like a hanging scale (in
                        connection with the sword) than a lamp. It seems significant that the
                        notorious cup, wrenched from the sorceror’s hand by the nearest

                <p>In the second <hi rend="i">Comus</hi> series, Blake makes significant changes in
                    Scene 4. The figure driving the serpent-team in B 4 is also female, as denoted
                    by her flowing hair, but she wears a light-colored garment, has no hood or veil,
                    and rides under a crescent moon.<ref target="n22" type="note">22</ref> Clearly
                    this female cannot be "Dark-veil’d Cotytto," who

                    personified in the masque (195-200). The most convincing identification of this
                    figure is Hecate, Cotytto’s companion in the masque. Evidence
                    supporting this is that Blake has portrayed Hecate’s companion with
                    Hecate’s serpentteam in H 4; and thus, when serpents (albeit not the
                    same serpents) reappear with a new driver, the sensible identification would be
                    their mistress Hecate. More evidence of the figure’s identity is the
                    Spirit’s reference (cited above) to having heard Comus and his rabble
                    performing rites to Hecate earlier in the night; consequently, her appearance in
                    B 4 is as logical as Cotytto’s presence in H 4. Third, in classical
                    authors Hecate (but not Cotytto) is frequently associated with the moon, as she
                    is here with the moon above her head. Originally she was a moon goddess (Osgood,
                    p. 29); Plutarch, for example, labels the moon Hecate’s province (<hi rend="i">Cess. of Oracles</hi>, 13). Blake refers to Hecate by name a number
                    of times, and he did several versions of a color-printed drawing of Hecate as
                    the triform goddess.<ref target="n23" type="note">23</ref>
                    <note id="n22">
                        <hi rend="s">22</hi> A similarity worth observing exists between
                        this female figure and one in the watercolor version (done for Thomas Butts)
                        of Plate 14, "The Morning Stars Sang Together," of
                        Blake’s <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of Job</hi>; the
                        similarity is pointed out by Pointon, who claims erroneously that the
                        figures are the same person (p. 171, n. 102). The female in <hi rend="i">Job</hi> also leads a red, blue, and scaled serpent-team much like
                        Blake’s H serpent-team, and also rides under a crescent moon.
                        However, the female figure has wings. For a color reproduction, see Kathleen

                        refers to a Hecate "drawing" or
                        "cartoon" (<hi rend="i">Complete Writings</hi>, p. 855) by
                        George Romney in his possession in 1804 (p. 849) and which he claims was
                        both well executed and well known (p. 855). This Romney <hi rend="i">Hecate</hi> may have influenced his own portrayals of the goddess;
                        certainly it must bear a relationship to the <hi rend="i">Comus</hi> Hecate,
                        for Blake describes it as "the figure with the torch and
                        snake" (p. 840). I have been unable to locate Romney’s
                        drawing, despite the able assistance of Shirley Martin of the Univ. of Maine
                        library at Farmington, who has made inquiries for me at Yale and Princeton,
                        which hold major Romney collections, and at Huntington, Frick, Courtland,
                        and Tate. Jean H. Hagstrum kindly referred my inquiry to his former student

                        of 1795; Jones made inquiries of Martin Butlin and of Ann Crookshank, a
                        leading Romney authority. Jones thinks Blake may have owned it, Butlin
                        believes that it probably belonged to Hayley, and Miss Crookshank surmises
                        that it is probably lost among the numerous Romney drawings scattered
                        throughout the world.</note>

                <p>Hecate’s identity proliferates in the later Classical poets, whose
                    view Milton follows (Osgood, p. 29). She is identified as Artemis,
                    Apollo’s twin sister and daughter of Zeus and Leto, and is said to
                    possess three identities: Selene (or Luna or Cynthia) in the sky, Artemis (or
                    Diana) on earth, and Proserpina (or Hecate) in hell and on the earth at
                        night.<ref target="n24" type="note">24</ref> She later becomes identified
                    with malignant divinity, witchcraft (Osgood, p. 29), and terror.<ref target="n25" type="note">25</ref> Moreover, she represents choice and
                    uncertainty: "She was associated with deeds of darkness, the Goddess of
                    the Crossways, which were held to be ghostly places of evil magic. . . . In her
                    is shown most vividly the uncertainty between good and evil which is apparent in
                    every one of the divinities" (Hamilton, p. 32). <note id="n24">

                <p>Blake’s decision to switch Cotytto for Hecate in B must be regarded as
                    a significantly different view of the masque—a second interpretation
                    that does not necessarily supersede the first. If Hecate now rides to attend the
                    Banquet of B 5, she would appear to supersede Cotytto as the reigning evil deity
                    over this and other B scenes, leaving Cotytto’s whereabouts a puzzle.
                    If we consider the masque again chronologically, she cannot be attending Comus
                    in B 1 during the events of B 4 because both B 1 and B 2 are past when B 4
                    occurs. Perhaps Blake thought of her as switching roles with Hecate and present
                    but not visible in B 2. The text, as discussed above, emphasizes the sorcery
                    (and by extension, Hecate) in the second scenes; yet in B 2 Blake does not
                    include (as he does in H) the visual emblem of <pb id="p12-169" n="169"/>

                    appears to de-emphasize the elements of enchantment.</p>
                <p>Hecate’s visual presence in the B designs draws attention away from
                    the themes Cotytto represents as it emphasizes the importance of sorcery and the
                    supernatural: the Attendant Spirit, Comus’s wand, the cup with
                    transmogrifying liquor, the monsters, the spells on the travelers and later on
                    the Lady, the enchanted herb, and Sabrina’s counter-spell releasing
                    the Lady. As Goddess of the Crossroads, Hecate also reinforces the theme of
                    choice, of the difficulty of making decisions in a deceptive world. A
                    cross-examination of all sixteen designs in terms of these motifs reveals a
                    general consistency: the H series usually emphasizes sensuality and the threat
                    of sexual force, as well as a strict virginity opposing that threat, rather than
                    the elements of witchcraft, deception, and choice. In the B series, the emphasis
                    is generally the reverse.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>In H 1 a stress on sexuality is apparent in the nudity of Comus and the
                    wolf-headed monster; in B all the figures are clad. Comus’s body is
                    more muscular than in B, and therefore more sexual and more treatening. The Lady
                    clasps her hands between her breasts (even more pronounced in H 5 where she
                    folds her hands protectively over her breasts), highlighting the theme of
                    defensive virginity; in B 1 her hands are unclasped and held away from her body.
                    Elements of sorcery in B are suggested by the attention Blake affords to the cup
                    with the magic potion: Comus holds it high and appears to be casting a spell
                    over it with his powerful wand; in H, however, the cup is not nearly so
                    conspicuous in the hand of the hog-monster. Also, the right foot of this female
                    monster is cloven, suggesting the demonic; but in H it is not.<ref target="n26" type="note">26</ref>
                    <note id="n26">
                        <hi rend="s">26</hi> This detail, apparent in the original, is
                        not so visible in reproductions: my copy of A. Fletcher’s color
                        reprints fails to show the clearly differentiated toes of the H
                        female’s left foot, making <hi rend="i">it</hi> appear cloven,
                        and his reprint of B is not sufficiently clear to show the
                        figure’s seemingly cloven left foot. The reproduction of H in the
                        Huntington catalog cited above is much clearer.</note>
                </p>
                <p>In H 2 the sexuality-virginity emphasis continues with an aged but still muscular
                    Comus in disguise: his neck and right arm are bullish, his frame solid; in B
                    Comus is noticeably younger and his build slighter. The Lady in H appears
                    distressed, fearful, anxious, and holds her upraised hands close to her body; in
                    B she displays no such worried expression, and her upraised hands are away from
                    her body in a less-threatened, more relaxed pose. Seemingly inconsistent with
                    Blake’s emphasis in H, as noted previously, is the appearance of <hi rend="i">haemony</hi> in the Spirit’s hand, an emblem of the
                    supernatural.</p>
                <p>Neither version of Scene 3 stresses sexuality over sorcery. The H Comus now

                    </figure> B Comus older (as shown by the lines in his face and neck).</p>
                <p>H 5 continues the muscular Comus; the B Comus is delicate, effeminate. However,
                    both are clothed, although thinly. Yet Comus in H is barefooted, with his right
                    foot close to the Lady’s and the big toe oddly short and raised
                    toward her. The H Lady covers her breasts in defense of her virginity, and she
                    sits in a chair with carvings of three bare-breasted female figures entwined
                    apparently with serpents; the carvings plainly embody the sensual temptation
                    that Comus is offering the Lady, and they contrast well with the
                    Lady’s defensive posture. The carved figures are absent in the B
                    chair, and the Lady’s hands are relaxed on her thighs. An emphasis in
                    B on sorcery can be seen in Blake’s positioning of the magic cup.
                    Just as in B 1, Blake in B 5 draws attention to it: Comus holds it high enough
                    to outline it clearly against the plain column behind; in H, Comus holds it so
                    low that its lines blend with those of Comus’s arm, hand, cape, the
                    bird-monster behind, and the covered dish below, which repeats the triangular
                    shape of the cup’s pedestal, reverses the shape of the cup itself,
                    and therewith obscures it. Also highlighting the sorcery in B is the visionary
                    and amazing serpent above Comus’s wand; clearly designed to represent
                    the spell Comus is casting over the Lady, the snake has no body apart from that
                    suggested by the lines of a nearly invisible two-layered cloud over the Lady.
                    Finally, the oddly shaped carafe held on a platter by the strange dwarf, to
                    which Comus points his wand, seems to reinforce the element of magic. The
                    cat-monster to the Lady’s left also holds an unusual container
                    apparently containing transforming liquid. Perhaps with the cup and these two
                    containers Blake is amplifying the text in providing Comus with several choices
                    for the Lady.</p>
                <p>In H 6 Comus is again more muscular than in B, and naked (as in H 1); the B Comus
                    is still clothed. Again the Lady in H tightly covers her breasts as she sits in
                    the carved chair; in B her hands still rest on her thighs. Suggestions of
                    sorcery are present in both versions: in B the four vanishing faces below
                    Comus’s wand are evil and demonic, especially the lowest one; in H
                    the faces, from bottom up, are a point-eared human face that seems to be
                    breathing red flames toward the brothers (Milton’s stage directions
                    after line 813 specify that the monsters give a show of resistance); a
                    bird-monster like that in B 5 (nearest the Lady); another human face, this one
                    with stubby horns; and above the wand, a long-eared horse head (from lines
                    553-54?).</p>
                <pb id="p12-173" n="173"/>
                <p>Neither seventh scene emphasizes sensuality. B suggests Sabrina’s
                    magic power more than H: she is covered by a bright rainbow at the end of which
                    sits the Lady; and Sabrina’s magic drops to purify the Lady are
                    emphasized visually by the shell in which she carries the liquid.<ref target="n27" type="note">27</ref> In H she merely holds her hand over the
                    Lady’s head. <note id="n27">
                        <hi rend="s">27</hi>
                            Sabrina’s purification rite (910-21) does not mention a
                            shell, but much earlier the Lady alludes to one in her lovely song,
                            song, "Sweet Echo": <q> "<hi rend="i">Sweet
                                    Echo, sweetest Nymph that liv’st unseen / Within thy
                                    airy shell / By slow Meander’s margent green</hi> . .
                                . " (230-32). </q> Blake’s shell in B 7 thus
                            stresses visually Sabrina’s identity as a water nymph; but
                            more important, it ties Sabrina to the Lady’s early plea to
                            the Nymph Echo for assistance in finding her brothers, consequently
                            involving Sabrina from the very beginning of the Lady’s
                            confrontation with evil.

                </p>
                <p>Neither eighth scene emphasizes sensuality. But the magical is clearly the
                    highlight of B, wherein the departing Attendant Spirit is executed with a
                    delicacy and a translucence complementing the brightness of the scene and giving
                    the sensation that one can almost see through him, that he is dissolving into
                    the air.</p>
                <p>Blake’s two series for <hi rend="i">Comus</hi>, then, are
                    considerations of the masque from different viewpoints. The masque itself is
                    particularly rich in connotations of both the sexuality-virginity theme and the
                    theme of witchcraft, magic, and the supernatural. The visual representatives of
                    these themes—the reigning powers of this particular night during
                    which the chaste Lady is in serious danger of seduction—are Cotytto
                    in H and Hecate in B. Blake’s use of these two pagan goddesses to
                    represent themes he accentuates fairly consistently throughout the two series
                    not only illuminates the masque by focusing attention on Milton’s
                    themes, but also highlights Blake’s own perception that Cotytto and
                    Hecate as powers of evil are at the very center of Milton’s drama in
                    which good and evil clash openly and forcibly, and in which both Milton and
                    Blake ultimately assert the necessity of making a proper choice between the
                    two.</p>

                <p>As students of Blake know, "the most formative literary and spiritual
                    influence" on him was the Bible.<ref target="n28" type="note">1</ref>
                    There is considerable uncertainty, however, about the extent of
                    Blake’s familiarity with the original language of the Old Testament,
                    Hebrew. Although at least eight of his illuminations contain Hebrew
                    inscriptions, "we do not know how much Hebrew Blake had . . .
                        ."<ref target="n29" type="note">2</ref> In the thirteen years since
                    Harold Bloom’s acknowledgment, that small island in the sea of Blake
                    scholarship has not, apparently, been covered. I will attempt, then, on the
                    basis of the inscriptions to assess Blake’s knowledge of and facility
                    with Hebrew. Because the irregularities in the inscriptions are so telling, we
                    can focus our attention exclusively on them. If they had been accurate and in a
                    good hand, their evidence would be equivocal. We could not know, in that case,
                    if Blake merely possessed a good eye for copying. <note id="n28">

                <p>An obvious reason for the uncertainty about Blake’s grasp is that most

                    concluded that the subject of Blake’s only lithograph, a bearded
                    "ancient" holding a book inscribed with his name, was
                    "Job in Prosperity."<ref target="n30" type="note">3</ref>

                <p>Only after the ascription had gained general acceptance did someone notice that
                    the name in Hebrew characters identifies the subject of the lithograph not as
                    Job, but as Enoch. "And he was no more because God took him"
                    (Genesis 5:24), the Biblical description of Enoch’s signal death, is
                    being scrutinized by two naked figures on the right side of the composition. A
                    further irony lies in the very name that was missed—for
                    "Enoch" ("Hanokh" in Hebrew) can mean
                    "education."</p>
                <p>Unable to assess Blake’s grasp of Hebrew from internal evidence,
                    Frederick Tatham, an early biographer, relied on circumstantial evidence from
                    Blake’s book collection. Finding Hebrew books "well thumbed
                    and dirtied by his graving hands," Tatham concluded that Blake had
                    "a most consummate knowledge" of the great Hebrew writers.<ref target="n31" type="note">4</ref> This highly questionable deduction can be
                    put in its proper perspective with the help of G. E. Bentley, Jr.: "As
                    a source of biographical facts [Tatham’s] <hi rend="i">Life</hi> is
                    of dubious value."<ref target="n32" type="note">5</ref>

                <p>Unfamiliarity with the language seems to be responsible for another disturbing
                    problem in Hebrew-related Blake scholarship. Blake’s lone reference
                    to his Hebrew studies, found in an 1803 letter to his brother James, contains
                    Hebrew characters. They have, however, been printed at least six different ways.
                    In 1921, Geoffrey Keynes printed the series as <rtl>אבכ</rtl> (ABK—’<hi rend="i">alef, bēth</hi>,<ref target="n33" type="note">6</ref>
                    <hi rend="i">kaf</hi>) i.e., "am now learning my Hebrew
                        ABK."<ref target="n34" type="note">7</ref> (Hebrew is written from
                    right to left. For ease of comprehension, however, I have written the English
                    equivalents which follow directly, and then the names of the Hebrew letters,
                    from left to right. An alphabet table is printed with my essay for the
                    reader’s reference.) This meaningless series was replaced by an
                    equally meaningless one in 1927: <rtl>אידב</rtl> (AYDB—’<hi rend="i">alef, yōd, daleth, bēth</hi>), four characters
                    instead of three.<ref target="n35" type="note">8</ref> Finally, in 1968 Keynes
                    proposed <rtl>אבג</rtl> (ABC—<hi rend="i">’alef, bēth,
                        gīmel</hi>)—a rendering which would put Blake at the

                <p>Mona Wilson, generally regarded as the best twentieth-century biographer of
                    Blake, remains consistent in printing the series as a four-letter group.
                    However, her 1949 rendering, <rtl>איונ</rtl> (AYON—<hi rend="i">‘alef, yōd, wāw, nūn</hi>),
                    becomes <rtl>איוב</rtl> (IYOV—<hi rend="i">‘alef, yōd,
                        wāw, vēth</hi>) in the 1969 revision.<ref target="n37" type="note">10</ref> This latter version, in striking contrast to
                    Keynes’s latest version (ABC), makes Blake a good Hebraist since <hi rend="i">IYOV</hi>, the original name for Job, is one of the most difficult
                    books in the Bible. Who, then, is correct? <note id="n37">

                        Wilson actually seems to be returning here to a second reading offered by

                </p>
                <p>By examining a photographic reproduction of the relevant portion of the letter
                    containing Blake’s lone reference to his Hebrew studies, I have found
                    that Keynes’s last variation, <rtl>אבג</rtl> (ABC), is accurate. No
                    explanation for Keynes’s forty-seven year delay or for other
                    divergent readings is provided by the difficulty "of mak[ing] out what
                    Blake [actually] wrote before he deleted the manuscript or erased the engraving

                    legible, as the reproduction below shows. Elsewhere in Blake’s Hebrew
                    inscriptions, however, there are relatively many obscurities and irregularities.
                    Their special character, in contrast to that of the English ones, suggests that
                    Blake never did master all of the Hebrew ABC’s. <note id="n38">

                    equally well to this one of 1804 throws into question Damon’s own
                    implication that Blake improved significantly in the years after <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts.</hi> To facilitate an evaluation here, I have included
                    alongside it a typical pair of tablets (a familiar motif in Jewish ceremonial
                        art).<ref target="n40" type="note">13</ref> Although several letters
                    scrawled on the tablets in Urizen’s hands are identifiable, they do
                    not form, without interpolation, Commandments or abbreviations for Commandments
                    that sometimes run to several sentences. If this plate existed in isolation, one
                    could argue for the appropriateness of the illegibility in that Urizen and the
                    tablets he holds are, to borrow a word from Blake’s caption, in the
                    process of annihilation. <note id="n39">

                <p>Another set of stone tablets of the Law, in "Job’s Evil
                    Dream" from the Butts watercolors of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi>,<ref target="n41" type="note">14</ref> begins to make such a
                    sympathetic view untenable. The last three letters from right to left in the
                    line indicated by Job’s persecutor compose "gave,"
                    incorrectly spelled as <rtl>נתנ</rtl> (NTN—<hi rend="i">nūn,
                        tāw, nūn</hi>). The <hi rend="i">nūn</hi>
                    (circled in reproduction), like several other Hebrew letters, requires a
                    different form at the end of a word. It is easily seen that Blake merely repeats
                    the regular <hi rend="i">nūn</hi> (<rtl>נ</rtl>). This loose parallel in
                    English may clarify <pb id="p12-181" n="181"/> the fundamental nature of the
                    error: spelling "jeopardy" with an
                    "i"—"jeopardi"—instead
                    of a "y" because the verb form uses the
                    "ize" suffix ("jeopardize"). Just as the
                    "i" cannot end "jeopardy," so a regular <hi rend="i">nūn</hi> cannot end <rtl>נתן</rtl>. This is not, apparently, the
                    only such error. <note id="n41">

                </p>
                <p>One way of explaining this inscription is by positing Blake’s use of a
                    transliteration. Since both regular letters and their final counterparts sound
                    identical, the English (Roman) character would not distinguish them. I have not
                    found evidence of printed transliterations of the Hebrew Bible extant in
                    Blake’s time, but it is possible that his instructor transliterated
                    the Ten Commandments for Blake.</p>
                <p>This hypothesis might also explain another "letter interchange"
                    committed in the Milton tablets. On the one in Urizen’s right hand,
                    Blake substitutes a ס (S—<hi rend="i">samkh</hi>) for what should
                    be a ת (S [according to the Ashkenazic pronunciation]—<hi rend="i">taw</hi>). These Commandments, however, are listed out of order
                    (10, <figure>
                        <head>

                    </figure> probably 9, 3), forcing us to posit more specifically a faulty
                    transliteration or a faulty reading of a correct transliteration.</p>
                <p>Another way of explaining some of Blake’s irregularities arises from
                    the tablets in "Job’s Evil Dream." There the sixth,
                    seventh, and eighth Commandments, according to the Hebrew reckoning, are listed
                    in correct sequence, although they appear in the seventh, eighth, and ninth
                    positions. In the sixth position is the phrase <rtl>א-להך נתנ</rtl> ("Your God
                    has given"); (the dash is to be disregarded. Jewish law prohibits
                    writing God’s name in this kind of context.) which we have discussed
                    earlier from a formal standpoint. Although neither a Commandment nor an
                    abbreviation for one, the phrase actually does originate in the sections of the
                    Bible containing the Ten Commandments (Exodus, ch. 20 and Deuteronomy, ch. 5).
                    In fact, these words are among the last in the fifth Commandment:
                    "Honor your father and mother so that your days may be many upon the
                    land which the Lord <hi rend="i">your God has given</hi> you." One may
                    be inclined to posit that Blake mistook the end of the fifth Commandment for the
                    beginning of the sixth. This would not explain, though, how Blake managed to
                    miscopy the final <hi rend="i">nūn</hi> (correctly written as ן,
                    not נ), if he had a text in front of him.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>However well they explain individual phenomena, neither of the hypotheses
                    suggested so far—nor others like faulty memory, which give Blake the
                    benefit of the doubt—explains everything. The unmethodical character
                    of the irregularities leaves us with two possible explanations: willful
                    subversion or ignorance. But the case for willful subversion—that
                    Blake knew better but deliberately made errors to disparage the tradition he saw
                    as "One [tyrannical] Law for the Lion and the Ox"; or that he
                    chose to keep himself a greenhorn to Hebrew on principle—is
                    simultaneously unsupportable and irrefutable. We do not know his mind.
                    Nevertheless, we seem justified in one conclusion. Given their elementary
                    nature, it makes most sense to see the <pb id="p12-183" n="183"/> irregularities
                    as arising from ignorance. To see intention here is to argue that
                    "jeopardi" spelled by an immigrant or elementary-school
                    student is deliberate.</p>
                <p>That mere carelessness is not Blake’s bane in the inscriptions can
                    best be seen through his rendering of the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet,
                    <rtl>א</rtl> (<hi rend="i">‘alef</hi>). The letter requires a diagonal bar
                    slanting up from right to left. In "The Laocoön" he
                    slants the bar in the opposite direction, down from right to left. In the
                    frontispiece to <hi rend="i">Job</hi> (1825), he slants it correctly. And in
                    "Job’s Evil Dream" (also 1825), he does both. Since
                    only an inch separates letters in the latter illumination, it is practically
                    impossible to believe that he did not notice the discrepancy. In all
                    probability, he thought that either form was acceptable—as in the
                    Arabic numeral "four," written "4" and
                    "4."</p>
                <p>We can, at this point, formulate a judgment more specific than Harold
                    Fisch’s when he says: Blake "knew little or no
                        Hebrew."<ref target="n42" type="note">15</ref> We have seen that he
                    was not entirely without Hebrew. Even a brief note like the following found
                    among the many proverb-like sayings in "The
                    Laocoön" suggests some familiarity: "He repented
                    that he had made Adam (of the Female, the Adamah)." A complete
                    foreigner to Hebrew would not know that the "ah" (<rtl> ָה</rtl>)
                    ending is feminine. We have seen, nonetheless, that the first of
                    Fisch’s possibilities—that Blake knew little
                    Hebrew—best fits the evidence.<ref target="n43" type="note">16</ref>

                <p>One of the interesting unsolved problems connected with Blake’s Hebrew
                    is his means of acquiring it. Unfortunately, even in an area like this, where no
                    Hebrew writing is involved, the scholarship is problematic. Damon indicates the
                    problem of Blake’s acquisition this way: "We do not know who
                    Blake’s teachers were . . . [In] London . . . he continued his
                    [Hebrew] studies, probably with some local rabbi . . . ."<ref target="n44" type="note">17</ref> G. E. Bentley, Jr. seems to have found the
                    solution. Basing his claim on the January 1803 letter to James, Bentley
                    identifies William Hayley as Blake’s tutor.<ref target="n45" type="note">18</ref> The letter, however, contains no reference to Hayley in

                    no evidence that Hayley knew enough Hebrew to serve as tutor.<ref target="n46" type="note">19</ref> Even with some energetic digging and good fortune, it
                    is possible, to use Blake’s words, that "this mystery never

                <p>The Mental Traveller" describes a cycle in which two figures, one male
                    and one female, grow from infancy to old age and back to infancy again. Each
                    grows younger as the other grows older, so that each is oldest when the other is
                    at the point of birth. This curious round of change becomes understandable when
                    we realize that the figures personify two complementary principles. However, the
                    interpretation of these principles and of their cycle of change has proved to be
                    puzzling and controversial. Of two main critical traditions, the earlier
                    represents the cycle as essentially prototypical of cyclic process, and in
                    particular of historical cycles.<ref target="n49" type="note">2</ref> Such a
                    generalizing approach is out of character for Blake, and the cyclic processes of
                    history are certainly within the grasp of "cold Earth
                    wanderers," while this cycle is explicitly said to go beyond their
                    knowledge. However, this tradition incorporates, in a simple and natural way,
                    the fact that each principle develops to its fullest manifestation and then
                    diminishes in the face of the growing opposing principle. The later tradition
                    involves interpretations in terms of the so-called "Orc
                    cycle": the Male Babe personifies revolt (Orc) and ages into a
                    personification of oppression (Urizen).<ref target="n50" type="note">3</ref>
                    Such a cycle is complete half way through the poem, and in spite of various
                    attempts to interpret the Female Babe, the second half of Blake’s
                    cycle remains logically impertinent.<ref target="n51" type="note">4</ref> In
                    both traditions, the cycle is seen as repeating. <note id="n49">

                        significance of the concept of the Female Babe, finds Frye’s
                        later reading also unsatisfactory, and sees her instead as a united form of

                <p>The reading we give in this paper follows the earlier tradition to the extent
                    that each principle is seen as aging into a mature form of itself. However, our
                    reading differs from that of the earlier tradition in that the cycle is
                    specifically seen as the theological cycle of Man’s fall from and
                    return to Eden. It is our aim to show that "The Mental
                    Traveller" portrays the successive states through which Man passes on
                    his eternal journey, as determined by the complementary interplay of two
                    principles in him: the Spiritual, expressed through his imaginative faculty, and
                    the Natural, expressed through his earthly nature.<ref target="n52" type="note">5</ref> This theme of Man’s eternal journey was of profound
                    importance to Blake, and inspires his entire mythology, so that the poem emerges
                    as a compact counterpart to his major work, and a summary of his spiritual
                    vision. <note id="n52">
                        <hi rend="s">5</hi> We thus agree with John Sampson, <hi rend="i">The Poetical Works of William Blake</hi> (1905; rpt. Boston:
                        Milford House, 1973), p. 273: "The poem . . . must be understood as
                        a picture of man’s spirit, passing through successive mental
                        states, and at last returning, ‘in endless circle,’ to
                        the point from which he started. In other words it is a restatement of
                        Blake’s favourite doctrine of constant generation and
                        regeneration." However, Sampson does not elaborate his
                    view.</note>
                </p>
                <p>It was Blake’s conviction that "Mental Things are alone
                    Real" (<hi rend="i">VLJ</hi>, E555, K617), and he considered it his
                    great task to "open the Eternal Worlds, to open the immortal Eyes / Of
                    Man inwards into the Worlds of Thought: into Eternity . . . " (<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 5:18-19, E146, K623). Whether we see the traveler as
                    the poet in his exploration of eternal reality, or as Man on his eternal
                    journey, the title of the poem indicates that the business of the poem is with
                    eternal things: "What are the Treasures of Heaven which we are to lay
                    up for ourselves, are they any other than Mental Studies &amp;
                    Performances? What are all the Gifts of the Gospel, are they not all Mental
                    Gifts?" (<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 77, E229, K717). It was also
                    Blake’s conviction that Man’s eternal states are
                    determined by a simple two-fold process in which truth is discovered as error is
                    destroyed: "All Life consists of these Two Throwing off Error
                    &lt;&amp;Knaves from our company&gt; continually &amp;
                    recieving Truth &lt;or Wise Men into our Company&gt;
                    Continually" (<hi rend="i">VLJ</hi>, E551, K612-13).<ref target="n53" type="note">6</ref> This two-fold process extends logically to encompass the
                    entire myth of Man’s fall and redemption: in the period when error,
                    or the Natural principle, is dominant, the states of Man are those associated
                    with the fall and Man’s subsequent history in the dimensions of time
                    and space; in the period when truth, or the Spiritual principle, <pb id="p12-185" n="185"/>
                    <figure/> is dominant, the states of Man are those associated with the
                    apocalypse and Man’s sojourn in paradise.<ref target="n54" type="note">7</ref> There is one state where there is no error, and in this
                    state Man is wholly divine and coincident with God.<ref target="n55" type="note">8</ref> This state, the state of Eden, closes the biblical narrative into a

                        <hi rend="s">9</hi> We differ here from Frye (<hi rend="i">Fearful Symmetry</hi>, p. 386). He rejects the idea of
                        "pulling the Bible around in a circle" on the grounds that
                        that would imply unending time, which would pervert the biblical meaning of
                        the word "eternity." However, the gap between the two ends
                        of the biblical narrative is included in Blake’s cycle and
                        transcends time.</note>
                </p>
                <p>We contend that "The Mental Traveller" describes this same
                    circle. Because Blake shows the continuity of states, the circle appears to be a
                    repetitive cycle, but is in fact merely complete. The poem is anti-Aristotelian
                    and, like eternity, has no beginning, middle, or end. In Blake’s
                    vision in the poem, Man, composed of contrary but complementary principles, is
                    seen as a continuous progression of states which in themselves form a unity, the
                    perfect form of the circle. The two principles in Man, the Spiritual and the
                    Natural, are personified, respectively, by the principal male and female figures
                    of the poem, the age of each representing the extent to which the corresponding
                    principle manifests in the being of Man. The cycle of the poem may be
                    graphically represented as in Figure 1.</p>
                <p>The poem begins at the point, shown at the bottom of the circle in Figure 1,
                    where the Natural principle is in its fullest manifestation, and the incarnation
                    of the Divine into the world of the Natural takes place. This incarnation is
                    represented by the birth of the Male Babe, who is most naturally associated with
                    Jesus. As the Spiritual gains in strength, the Natural principle becomes
                    correspondingly less dominant until, at the left-most point of the circle, it is
                    overpowered by the Spiritual principle. In the life-cycle of Man, this
                    overpowering of the Natural by the Divine corresponds to the spiritual awakening
                    of Man at the apocalypse. In the continuing process of the Last Judgment, the
                    errors of the natural world are progressively destroyed as eternal truths are
                    recognized. This process reaches its completion only when the natural delusion
                    has decreased to vanishing point and all creation is consumed. Here, at the
                    topmost point of the circle, Man finds himself in the state of Eden, where he is
                    coincident with God, the "Heavenly Father."<ref target="n57" type="note">10</ref> When the Natural principle reappears as the Female
                    Babe, it is in a growing phase, and increases in strength until, at the
                    right-most point of the circle, the Spiritual is drawn into its power. This
                    overpowering of the Divine by the Natural corresponds to the fall, where Man
                    sinks into a spiritual sleep.<ref target="n58" type="note">11</ref> The Natural
                    principle continues to gain in strength, while the Spiritual principle grows
                    correspondingly weaker, until Humanity identifies itself with purely natural
                    Man, who lives in the state of the earthly paradise, or lower garden. Thus we
                    arrive again at the point where the incarnation of the Spiritual principle is to
                    take place. <note id="n57">

                        <hi rend="s">11</hi> Just as the Last Judgment is seen as a
                        process lasting a full half-cycle (from the incarnation to the state of

                        (from the state of Eden to the state where the incarnation takes place).
                        However, we use the word "fall" to denote the specific
                        stage of the process where the Natural principle attains dominance over the
                        Spiritual.</note>

                <p>The images that Blake uses in the poem to express the varying relationships of
                    the two principles, especially at the cardinal points of the cycle, have their
                    parallels in the biblical narrative and are used in similar contexts elsewhere
                    in Blake’s work.<ref target="n59" type="note">12</ref> The torture of
                    the Male Babe is fairly closely paralleled in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (66:
                    17-33, E216, K702; 68:57-58, E220, K706-07). The sexual act as metaphoric
                    portrayal of the apocalypse (implicit in the biblical image of the Bride and
                    Bridegroom) is found as part of a prophetic vision in the
                    "Preludium" to <hi rend="i">America</hi> (2:3-4, E50-51,
                    K196). The banquet encountered towards the end of the quarter cycle leading to
                    the state of Eden (corresponding to the "supper of the great
                    God" at the Last Harvest and Vintage, in Rev. 19:17) is the golden
                    feast of the Eternals described in Night 9 of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>
                    <pb id="p12-186" n="186"/> (E385-90, K372-78). The representation of the fall in
                    terms of a man drawn into the power of a woman (which is symbolically related to
                    the biblical theme of the Sons of God descending to the daughters of men, prior
                    to the Flood), is encountered in Night 1 of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>
                    (5:13-14, E298, K266: 76-77) in the image of Tharmas sinking into the sea into
                    Enion’s woof. <note id="n59">
                        <hi rend="s">12</hi> The parallels for
                        imagery at the points of the fall, incarnation, and apocalypse have been
                        pointed out by various writers. Of these writers, Raine (<hi rend="i">Blake
                            and Tradition</hi>, I, 306-25) offers the most comprehensive
                        identifications. Raine has also been most successful in tracing
                        Blake’s imagery for the fall. In his earlier work, Blake,
                        possibly inspired by Thomas Taylor’s account of the Persephone
                        myth (see Raine, I, 67, 133), concentrates on the theme of the descent of
                        the soul, personified by a female figure (Lyca, Thel, Oothoon, the early
                        Vala).</note>
                </p>
                <p>Before we come to a more detailed discussion of the poem, we would like to refer
                    to passages from Henry Crabb Robinson’s record of conversations with
                    Blake<ref target="n104" type="note">13</ref> which help to clarify certain of Blake’s theological ideas
                    relevant to our reading of the poem.<ref target="n60" type="note">14</ref>
                    Robinson writes:" . . . his philosophy he repeated—Denying
                    Causation asserting everything to be the work of God or the Devil, That there is
                    a constant falling off from God— Angels becoming Devils . . . Every
                    man has a Devil in him and the conflict is eternal between a man’s
                    Self and God . . . " (BBR 318). The "constant" fall
                    is redeemed by Imagination, which Blake identifies with Jesus and God, as he
                    asserts in the <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> inscription: "The
                    Eternal Body of Man is the IMAGINATION. that is God himself The Divine Body
                    Jesus" (E271, K776). It is important to our reading of the poem to
                    realize that although Jesus, the Imagination, is one with God, they are
                    distinguished in the sense that Jesus <hi rend="i">becomes</hi> the Father. This
                    is explained by Blake in the following conversation delightfully recorded by
                    Robinson: <q> . . . I had suggested . . . the <hi rend="i">impossibility</hi> of
                        supposing an immortal being created—An eternity a parte
                        post—without an eternity a parte ante . . . His eye brightened on
                        my saying this And he eagerly concurred—’To be sure it
                        is impossible—We are all coexistent with God—Members
                        of the Divine body—We are all partakers of the divine
                        nature’ . . . on my asking in what light he viewed the great
                        question concerning the Divinity of Jesus Christ He
                            said—‘<hi rend="i">He is the only
                        God.</hi>’—But then he
                        added—’And so am I and so are
                        you’—Now he had just before . . . been speaking of the
                        errors of Jesus Christ: ‘he was wrong in suffering himself to be
                        crucified. He should not have attacked the government; he had no business
                        with such matters.’ On my enquiring how he reconciled this with
                        the Sanctity &amp; divine qualities of Jesus—he said
                        ‘He was not then become the father.’ (BBR 310-11) </q>
                    Jesus, therefore, personifies to Blake the Spiritual principle in its early
                    stages, when it is still weak and at the mercy of the Natural. The Father is the
                    Spiritual principle when it is dominant and nature is subjugated.

                        <hi rend="s">14</hi> While these two principles function as
                        though autonomous, the Spiritual is superior. In <hi rend="i">The Marriage
                            of Heaven and Hell</hi>, in the "Devil’s"
                        voice, Blake states as an error the notion "That Man has two real
                        existing principles Viz: a Body &amp; a Soul," and that, on
                        the contrary, "that calld Body is a portion of Soul discernd by the
                        five Senses" (<hi rend="i">MHH</hi> 4, E34, K149). The Devil only
                        exists "by God’s permission" (BBR 318).
                        Kathleen Raine therefore rightly states that "There is only one
                        agent" (<hi rend="i">Blake and Tradition</hi>, I, 313). It follows
                        that an apt visual image for representing the two components in Man is
                        provided by the complementary bright and dark parts of the moon’s
                        disk in its cycle of phases. The lunar symbolism has been elaborated upon by
                        Yeats in the construction of his theory of the double gyres in <hi rend="i">A Vision</hi>, and Raine applies this theory in her reading of the

                        to associate the narrative in the poem with the biblical narrative,
                        indicating parallels in Blake’s other works where these appear
                        helpful, in order to show that the cycle of the poem is that of
                        Man’s eternal journey. Where we pass over details, we may be
                        understood to accept the excellent and generally thorough exegeses of the
                        poem by Raine, Paley, and Adams.</p>
                    <p>In the first stanza, Blake alludes to the visionary perspective adopted in
                        the poem: <q> I traveld thro’ a Land of Men<lb/> A Land of Men
                            &amp; Women too<lb/> And heard &amp; saw such dreadful
                            things<lb/> As cold Earth wanderers never knew. </q> "Men
                        &amp; Women," as Sutherland points out
                        ("Blake’s ‘Mental
                        Traveller’," p. 140), refers to eternal archetypes, and
                        it follows that the poet visited the regions of Man’s eternal
                        reality. In Blake, the eternal energies, such as the Zoas, have emanations,
                        to which they stand in a primary relationship, so that the eternal world is
                        a land of Men "&amp; Women too." The
                        "dreadful" things recounted by the traveler are the events
                        of this land of eternal reality, which are awe-ful, or sublime. Earth
                        wanderers are "cold" because they are antipodally removed
                        from the fire in the spiritual hearth, which we meet in stanza 11.</p>
                    <p>The second stanza explains the events at the four cardinal points of the
                        cycle in terms of conception and birth. The lines "For there the
                        Babe is born in joy / That was begotten in dire woe" refer to both
                        of the births in the poem, that of the Boy, and that of the Female Babe. The
                        "joy" is experienced by the principle that is born anew,
                        for it is in a growing and assertive phase, and will triumph over the
                        opposing principle a quarter-cycle later. At the sexual encounter a
                        quarter-cycle earlier, the diminishing principle entered the
                        "womb" of the other, which to it is a "dire
                        woe." The Boy is conceived at the fall, and the implication is
                        simply that Jesus is born of the flesh. Hence, in "To
                        Tirzah" Blake’s narrator can ask, "Thou Mother
                        of my Mortal part / . . . what have I to do with thee?" (E30,
                        K220), and in <hi rend="i">The Everlasting Gospel</hi> Blake writes of the
                        "Serpent Bulk of Natures dross" (E515, K749) which is to
                        be nailed to the cross. In the case of the Female Babe, the sexual encounter
                        is the "dire woe" of the apocalypse, when nature is
                        subjugated to the Eternal Imagination.</p>
                    <p>The first line of the third stanza, "And if the Babe is born a
                        Boy," identifies the point at which Blake chooses to begin his
                        description of the traversal of the cycle, that of the incarnation of the
                        spirit into the natural world. Evidently, Blake is interested in charting
                        the "dreadful" events of the spirit, following it in its
                        cycle of evolution, from its birth, through subsequent growth, to its
                        decline. The diverse images of torture that follow evoke associations with
                        Prometheus, Orc, and as Raine suggests, with Dionysus (who was lacerated,
                        and who like Christ had a heavenly father and an earthly mother). However,
                        the most sustained reference is to the suffering of Christ (as is the case
                        in the parallel description in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 66). Incarnated
                        in the natural world, the spirit has to undergo the excruciating tensions of
                        the contraries operating in this world: The Old Woman cuts the
                        Boy’s heart out "To make it feel both cold &amp;
                        heat." As the Boy grows older, thus stronger, his sufferings become
                        less intense. Since she lives "upon his <pb id="p12-187" n="187"/>
                        shrieks &amp; cries," she is increasingly deprived of
                        sustenance, and in the process grows weaker and, paradoxically, younger and
                        more becoming, until, in the sixth stanza, she is a "Virgin
                        bright." Thus nature, as she becomes suffused with the imaginative,
                        loses her threatening aspect and actually becomes the delight of the
                        Spiritual. The dialectic of nature and spirit thus moves towards
                        apocalypse.</p>
                    <p>The apocalypse is described, in the sixth stanza, in terms of the male
                        sexually overpowering the female. In this state, Man (or Albion) awakes and
                        begins to live imaginatively, aware of his divinity. The Spiritual
                        principle, now dominant, is able to control the natural world with
                        increasing ease and joy, where before the apocalypse it could express itself
                        in nature only through suffering. Before, the Old Woman’s fingers
                        numbered his every nerve (stanza five); now, he plants himself in all her
                        nerves, and she becomes his dwelling place (stanza seven). This natural
                        world, however, is shrinking, and as it shrinks, it yields up a harvest in
                        ever more concentrated form. Thus, in stanza 7 nature is reduced, through
                        spiritual husbandry, to a garden which bears its fruit abundantly, and in
                        stanza 8 to an earthly cottage, filled with treasure. Thus, as the treasure
                        is gathered in, it becomes purer, for its spiritual density increases, and
                        of smaller dimension, as error is removed. The nature of this treasure is
                        explained in stanza 9. It is the "gems of the Human Soul,"
                        described in images of suffering, drawn from courtly-love poetry:
                        "a lovesick eye," "the lovers sigh,"
                        "the akeing heart" and "The martyrs
                        groan." The treasure which nature delivers up is therefore that of
                        the spiritual loves and sufferings of Man on this earth. These have been
                        preserved, and are now brought forth, in ever purer form, to serve as food
                        for the Spiritual: " . . . the gems of the Human Soul / . . . / . .
                        . are his meat . . . are his drink" (ninth and tenth stanzas).</p>
                    <p>The meaning of the first two lines of stanza eight is crucial, for divergent
                        interpretations of the poem hinge on it: "An aged Shadow soon he
                        fades / Wandring round an Earthly Cot." In the tradition of
                        Rossetti—Ellis &amp; Yeats—Raine, the
                        "aged Shadow," fading, is seen as effete, and in the Orc
                        cycle tradition, as restrictive. We suggest that "aged"
                        merely indicates that the Spiritual principle is nearing full manifestation
                        and greatest potency, just as the Female was most powerful when most old. To
                        the natural eye, however, the Spiritual when most manifest is paradoxically
                        least visible, thus becoming a "Shadow" that fades, as it
                        wanders around the last vestiges of the natural in a world that has become
                        nearly completely spiritual. Although eternal substance appears shadowy to
                        mortal man, the poet, the visionary traveler, knows that the world of the
                        Father is the "Imagination the real &amp; eternal World . . .
                        in which we shall live in our Eternal or Imaginative Bodies, when these
                        Vegetable Mortal Bodies are no more" (<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                        77, E229, K717). In this world, the "Land of Men," the
                        " . . . Inhabitants [are] walking up &amp; down in
                        Conversations concerning Mental Delights . . . Here they are . . .
                        Conversing with Eternal Realities as they Exist in the Human Imagination . .
                        . " (<hi rend="i">VLJ</hi>, E552, K613). Paradise is therefore
                        populated with eternal forms.</p>
                    <p>Like the Good Samaritan, the Spiritual nourishes the developing eternal forms
                        as well as the visiting poet: "He feeds the Beggar &amp; the
                        Poor / And the wayfaring Traveller / For ever open is his door"
                        (stanza 10). As Jesus becomes the beneficent Father, his hospitality is
                        reminiscent of the parable of the marriage feast, and of the miracle of the
                        feeding of the multitude. The grief that the Father experienced in nature
                        while he was the Son is transformed and experienced as joy by the guests:
                        "His grief is their eternal joy" (stanza 11). The joy of
                        the guests (whom we shall meet again "scatterd thro’ the
                        land" in stanza 16) is in antipodal contrast to the agony of the
                        Boy, whose sufferings fed the Old Woman.</p>
                    <p>As the last vestiges of nature, or error, disappear, the atmosphere at the
                        feast becomes that of an ale-house: "They make the roofs &amp;
                        walls to ring." We are reminded of "The Little
                        Vagabond" in <hi rend="i">The Songs of Experience</hi>: <q> But if
                            at the Church they would give us some Ale.<lb/> And a pleasant fire, our
                            souls to regale;<lb/> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
                            .<lb/> Then the Parson might preach &amp; drink &amp;
                            sing.<lb/> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<lb/> And God
                            like a father rejoicing to see,<lb/> His children as pleasant and happy
                            as he:<lb/> Would have no more quarrel with the Devil . . .<lb/>
                            <lb/>
                            (E26, K216) </q> In the description of the golden feast, in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, Night 9, we find a similar allusion to
                        intoxication: <q> Attempting to be more than Man We become less said
                            Luvah<lb/> As he arose from the bright feast drunk with the wine of
                            ages<lb/> His crown of thorns fell from his head . . .<lb/>
                            <lb/>
                            (135:21-23, E388, K376:709-11) </q> This recurring emphasis on drunken
                        revels in sacred context is explained by Blake’s remark to Henry
                        Crabb Robinson that "What are called the vices in the natural
                        world, are the highest sublimities in the spiritual world" (BBR
                        316).</p>
                    <p>Stanzas 10 and 11, then, describe the state of Eden. Here, there are no more
                        traces of the natural (thus, "no more quarrel with the
                        Devil"). The treasure has shrunk to its vanishing point, and the
                        eternal forms appear fully assembled as the "Family
                        Divine." This family is the "Council of God"
                        which, omnipresent, watches over the "Body / Of Man" (<hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, Night 4, 55:10-11, E330, K304: 247-48). The
                        divine family is not visible to mortal eyes. Here, in the state of Eden, the
                        dominant Zoa in Man is Urthona. S. Foster Damon (<hi rend="i">A Blake
                            Dictionary</hi>, 1965; rpt. New York: Dutton, 1971, p. 426) mentions
                        that Urthona never manifests in his own person, and is frequently called
                        "dark."</p>
                    <p>In the process of the Last Judgment, "Error or Creation" is
                        "Burned Up" (<hi rend="i">VLJ</hi>, E555, K617). In stanza
                        11 we find fire in the hearth, the center of the divine dwelling.
                        Nature’s last vestiges have <pb id="p12-188" n="188"/>
                        disappeared into this fire, from which nature is reborn, phoenix-like, as
                        "A little Female Babe." In stanza 12, she is said to be
                        "all of solid fire/And gems &amp; gold." Solidity,
                        alien to fire, and characteristic of the natural, already indicates the
                        beginning of the fall. The "gems &amp; gold" which
                        filled the cottage in stanza 8 were associated there with the last
                        transfigured residue of the Natural. Now we encounter the same image once
                        again. It is one that Blake uses elsewhere in his work to describe the
                        adornment of the serpent form (for instance, <hi rend="i">VDA</hi> 8:7, E49,
                        K195), and here it gives a fleeting glimpse of the serpent’s
                        presence in Eden.<ref target="n61" type="note">15</ref>
                        <note id="n61">
                            <hi rend="s">15</hi> Viewing the infant Natural principle as
                            a serpent coiled around the "tree" of the fully

                            principle as a serpent coiled around the "tree" of
                            fully manifested nature. This is supported in <hi rend="i">The Four
                                Zoas</hi>, Night 7 (a), where Orc is described as organizing a
                            serpent body and stretching up Urizen’s tree of mystery (80:
                            44, 81: 3-5, E349, K324: 152, 162-64). The first tree is the tree of
                            life, and the second tree is the tree of the knowledge of good and
                            evil.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Natural principle, in its growing phase, is not susceptible to control:
                        " . . . none his hand / Dares stretch to touch her Baby form / Or
                        wrap her in his swaddling-band" (stanza 12). By contrast, Jesus
                        submitted to swaddling clothes. In the previous quarter-cycle, approaching
                        Eden, nature was pleased to serve the Divine, as in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>: <q> The Female searches sea &amp; land for
                            gratifications to the<lb/> Male Genius: who in return clothes her in
                            gems &amp; gold<lb/> And feeds her with the food of Eden . .
                            .<lb/>
                            <lb/> (69:16-18, E221, K707) </q> But now the situation
                        corresponds to that described in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, Night 9:
                            <q> And Many Eternal Men sat at the golden feast to see<lb/> The female
                            form now separate They shudderd at the horrible thing<lb/> Not born for
                            the sport and amusement of Man but born to drink up all his powers<lb/>
                            They wept to see their shadows they said to one another this is Sin<lb/>
                            This is the Generative world they rememberd the Days of old.<lb/>
                            <lb/>
                            (133:5-9, E386, K373:621-25) </q> In Robinson’s diary we
                        read: "On my inquiring whether the Devil would not be destroyed by
                        God as being of less power—he denied that God has any
                        power—Asserted that the Devil is eternally created not by
                        God—but by God’s permission" (BBR 318). In
                        view of this lack of power on the part of the Divine principle, the birth of
                        the Female Babe is thematically associated with the creation of Adam and
                        Eve, who will disobey the Father. Adam and Eve are to be seen as united in
                        forming the natural component. This tallies with Blake’s <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> inscription: "Adam is only The
                        Natural Man &amp; not the Soul or Imagination" (E271, K776),
                        and with the Chapter titles of his Genesis manuscript: "Chapter 1
                        The Creation of the Natural Man / Chapter 11 The Natural Man divided into
                        Male &amp; Female . . . " (E667, K933).</p>
                    <p>The growing Natural principle organizes whatever mental forms prove
                        susceptible to her influence: "But She comes to the Man she loves /
                        If young or old or rich or poor" (stanza 13). In this process the
                        "aged Host" is driven out, and he is now a beggar
                        "at another’s door," rather than the earlier
                        benevolent host. He develops a need for companionship and turns to the
                        maiden. Coming at the stage just before the fall, this action is reminiscent
                        of the Genesis account of the Lord walking in the Garden in the cool of the
                        evening and calling out to Adam and Eve. The
                        Divine—"freezing," since it has wandered far
                        from the spiritual hearth—now succumbs to the attraction of the
                        Natural, and the fall takes place: "The Cottage fades before his
                        sight / The Garden &amp; its lovely Charms" (stanza 15). With
                        the fall, Man’s perceptions undergo a radical change. His senses
                        conglobe and perceive everything in distorted fashion, round and bounded:
                        "For the Eye altering alters all / The Senses roll themselves in
                        fear / And the flat Earth becomes a Ball" (stanza 16). Blake states
                        elsewhere that "Reality was Forgot &amp; the Vanities of Time
                        &amp; Space only Rememberd &amp; calld Reality" (<hi rend="i">VLJ</hi>, E545, K605). Thus it is that Man begins to live in
                        the fallen world of time and space: Albion has fallen asleep.</p>
                    <p>The living forms of the "Stars Sun Moon" now shrink away
                        (stanza 17), leaving an imaginative desert in which the heavenly bodies are
                        experienced only through Man’s fallen senses. There is no more
                        sustenance for the former guests (eternal forms), and they are
                        "scatterd thro’ the land" (stanza 16). There
                        is, however, mention of another banquet in stanza 18: <q> The honey of her
                            Infant lips<lb/> The bread &amp; wine of her sweet smile<lb/> The
                            wild game of her roving Eye<lb/> Does him to Infancy beguile. </q> This
                        banquet is the antipodal counterpart to the divine banquet and corresponds
                        to the feast of Los and Enitharmon, described in <hi rend="i">The Four
                            Zoas</hi>, Night 1: <q> The Earth spread forth her table wide. the Night

                        word "Love," or a derivative, occurs four times: the food
                        of the banquet is that of natural love.</p>
                    <p>Nature continues to be alluring and is pursued by the spirit: <q> Like the
                            wild Stag she flees away<lb/> Her fear plants many a thicket wild<lb/>
                            While he pursues her night &amp; day<lb/> By various arts of Love
                            beguild. (stanza 20) </q> Both principles are in a state of dislocation:
                        they wander "in terror &amp; dismay" (stanza 19). Her
                        flight from him is not to entice; she actually fears him. Her resistance
                        causes thickets to grow in the desert. The thickets and
                        "Labyrinths" (stanza 21) describe the state that is
                        created when the Spiritual principle is led into the pursuit of the riddle
                        of matter. We thus arrive at the stage where, of his four faces, Man
                        presents that of reason, the Zoa <pb id="p12-189" n="189"/> Urizen.<ref target="n62" type="note">16</ref> In this labyrinthine state roam the

                        (stanza 21), those animals that will flee howling at the incarnation, in
                        stanza 25. In the Book of Enoch, in a dream-vision of Enoch, in which the
                        history of the world is related with animal characters, these animals, among
                        others, appear in the role of enemies of Israel: the boars are the Edomites,
                        the lions the Babylonians, and the wolves the Egyptians.<ref target="n63" type="note">17</ref>

                    <p>As the Natural principle increases to full maturity, we move towards the
                        construction of the earthly paradise (stanzas 22,23): <q> Then many a Lover
                            wanders here<lb/> The Sun &amp; Stars are nearer rolld<lb/> The
                            trees bring forth sweet Extacy. </q> This state is called, in <hi rend="i">Thel</hi>, "the vales of Har" (4:10, E5,
                        K129), and, in <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi>, "the pleasant gardens of
                        Har" (2:10, E274, K100) and "the lower garden"
                        (8:1, E281, K109). In this state, Man is infatuated with physical forms,
                        well expressed in the senile preoccupations of Har and Heva in <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> (2, E274-75, K100-02).<ref target="n64" type="note">18</ref> Like the Romans at the time of the birth of Christ, Man wants
                        to create "the good life," independent of his eternal
                        destiny. Thus, in the desert "many a City . . . is Built / And many
                        a pleasant Shepherds home" (stanza 23). Man tries to establish
                        "a joy without pain, / . . . a solid without fluctuation"
                            (<hi rend="i">BU</hi> 4:10-11, E70, K224). <note id="n64">
                            <hi rend="s">18</hi> One sees in Har and Heva an aged form of Adam and Eve,
                            watched over by the "now aged" Mnetha (<hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> 2: 6, E274, K100), their nurse, or Mother Nature. All
                            three of these figures are of course associated with the Natural
                            principle: we recall that Adam (with Eve) is natural Man, while
                            "Goddess Nature" is "Satan’s
                            Wife" (<hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi>, E270, K777). In

                            him.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The references to "Stars . . . nearer rolld" and
                        "Shepherds" serve to remind us of the circumstances
                        preceding Christ’s birth. When the birth of the Babe is
                        discovered, it strikes terror "thro the region wide"
                        (stanza 25). The Spiritual principle <figure/> is now emerging from its
                        sojourn in the "womb" of nature, where an integument has
                        been woven for it, enabling it to exist in this world and declare its own
                        nature. The spirit is no longer available to serve in the pursuit of earthly
                        love and happiness. It will of course be tortured in this world. Thel,
                        brooding over the self-contained processes of the womb of nature, innocently
                        anticipates that she will once again "gentle hear the voice / Of
                        him that walketh in the garden in the evening time" (<hi rend="i">Thel</hi> 1:13-14, E3, K127), the state of the spirit before the fall.
                        However, allowed to view the incarnated state, she witnesses instead the
                        suffering of the Boy, and flees back in horror to the safety of the vales of
                        Har.</p>
                    <p>With the birth and torture of the Male Babe, we arrive at the same event
                        described at the start of the ballad. The last two lines, "She
                        nails him down upon the Rock / And all is done as I have told"
                        (stanza 26), suggest that the process continues in the way described in the
                        poem. However, as we argued above, the cycle is merely a representation of
                        the various states in which Man may find himself, and the apparent
                        sequentiality is part of the metaphor used to represent contiguous
                        states.</p>
                    <p>The history of Man as a cycle from eternity to eternity is also recounted in
                        Blake’s epic, <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi>
                        <ref target="n65" type="note">19</ref> We conjecture that there is a basic correspondence
                        between "The Mental Traveller" narrative and <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> narrative. A sketch of the alternation of the Zoas,
                        as we understand them to reach prominence as we traverse the Mental
                        Traveller’s cycle, might serve to suggest an alignment between
                        the two narratives, as indicated in Figure 2. <pb id="p12-190" n="190"/> It
                        seems natural to assume, with Roe, that all four Zoas, together with their
                        Emanations, are present at every stage of Blake’s cycle, and that
                        the predominance of any one depends upon the state of the cycle in which the
                        Divine Humanity finds itself.<ref target="n66" type="note">20</ref> In
                        eternity, the Emanations are absorbed in their respective Zoas, but at the
                        fall they separate and progressively reject eternity until the limit of
                        opacity is reached and the incarnation takes place. <note id="n65">

                            feast, while Urizen is in the vicinity (E385, 388, 390; K372, 376,

                    </p>
                    <p>It will be useful to visualize the Zoas, the "Four Faces"
                        of Man (<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 98:26, E255, K745), round the four sides
                        of a head, as in Blake’s drawing <hi rend="i">Ezekiel’s Vision</hi> (<hi rend="i">William Blake:
                            water-color drawings</hi>, Boston: Museum of Fine Arts, 1957, n. pag.).
                        When one face is fronting us, the two faces on either side are seen in
                        profile, and the one at the back is not visible. Luvah is the Zoa who
                        presides over the apocalypse. However, his face already begins to show (as
                        Orc) with the birth of the Spiritual at the incarnation. Similarly, the face
                        of Urthona starts to take shape at the apocalypse, but will only be fully
                        exposed as the heavenly Father when the eternal company is gathered for the
                        divine feast in Eden. In Eden, the face of Tharmas, the Zoa in terms of whom
                        the fall is described, is already appearing. And at the fall, the face of
                        Urizen comes into view, but will only manifest frontally when reason is
                        dominant and trying to establish the earthly paradise.<ref target="n67" type="note">21</ref>

                    <p>We turn now to possible equivalents of the cycle of "The Mental
                        Traveller" in Blake’s pictorial art. Like many of
                        Blake’s works, the designs discussed below demonstrate
                        Blake’s belief in the co-presence of the Natural and Spiritual
                        principles in Man. Also, like "The Mental Traveller,"
                        these designs are apocalyptic visions which not only describe
                        Man’s destiny in and through the Natural, but also complete his
                        destiny by imaginative inference of the Spiritual or Divine.</p>
                    <p>In the title-page to his Job illustrations, Blake chose to arrange the seven
                        angels in a semi-circular form. If we superimpose this half-circle onto the
                        bottom half of the circle in Figure 1, it covers that part of the cycle that
                        stretches from the fall to the apocalypse. We agree with Damon that the
                        seven angels are the seven Eyes of God, and that they are seven states which
                        "were divinely instituted so that man should mechanically be
                        brought back to communion with God."<ref target="n68" type="note">22</ref> The first Eye, Lucifer, is the angel associated with the fall.
                        He looks out of the page, a glance followed by most of the angels coming
                        after and indicating the error of turning outward towards the natural. The
                        bottom angel, Shaddai, is given a prominent position and provides the pivot
                        for the upward movement which is to follow. The seventh Eye, Jesus, looks
                        inward toward the recognition of the eternal forms. The top half of the
                        circle is present by implication, for it is not visible to our vegetative
                        eye. The eighth Eye is, however, not invisible to the poet who has
                        experienced the apocalypse in imagination: appropriately, it is discovered
                        in <hi rend="i">Milton.</hi> There it is the "Eighth / Image Divine
                        tho’ darken’d" (15:5-6, E108, K496) that
                        accompanies the "Spirits of the Seven Angels of the
                        Presence," and the "Shadowy Eighth" (20:47, E114,
                        K502). It is called "Shadowy" and
                        "darken’d" since it is entering the region
                        wrapped in darkness from the understanding of natural Man. <note id="n68">

                        attempt to depict the same cycle as "The Mental
                        Traveller." Behemoth ("the chief of the ways of
                        God") is positioned where the Spiritual principle is dominant, its
                        head at the point of the apocalypse, its tail at the fall. Leviathan
                        ("King over all the Children of Pride") rears its head at
                        the fall and tails off towards the apocalypse. Significantly, water fills
                        the lower half of the disk. Both in this design and in the frontispiece to
                            <hi rend="i">Europe, The Ancient of Days</hi>, an apparently divine
                        figure is situated above and extends his arm towards the actual or implied
                        circle. In the frontispiece to <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, this figure, shown
                        with compasses, is frequently identified with Urizen, in the act of
                        creation. It may, however, also be seen as the figure of Tharmas, at the
                        moment prior to his fall: <q> Tharmas groand among his Clouds<lb/> Weeping,
                            then bending from his Clouds he stoopd his innocent head<lb/> And
                            stretching out his holy hand in the vast Deep sublime<lb/> Turnd round
                            the circle of Destiny . . .<lb/>
                            <lb/> (<hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>,
                            Night 1, 5:8-11, E298, K266: 71-74) </q> Some critics incline to view
                        the circle of destiny as a purely natural cycle, one which Man can traverse
                        repeatedly until escape is possible through a process of rebirth.<ref target="n69" type="note">23</ref> The implication is that the circle of
                        destiny is attached to a separate supernal cycle. It is our contention that
                        the supernal cycle is not separate from the circle of destiny, but
                        intertwined with it. That is, there is but a single cycle, and the circle of
                        destiny, which Tharmas turns round, is but the natural component of the
                        cycle, in complementary relationship with the supernal component.<ref target="n70" type="note">24</ref> In the frontispiece to <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, then, the divine figure depicts the face of Man at the
                        stage when we enter the fall and meet our earthly destiny. At this stage
                        Tharmas is dominant, and it is he who can say: "Return O Wanderer
                        when the Day of Clouds is oer" (<hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>,
                        Night 1, 5:12, E298, K266: 75). <note id="n69">

                            <hi rend="s">24</hi> Blake talks of "the vast form
                            of Nature like a serpent . . . " (<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                            43: 76, E190, K655). The natural component of the cycle is thus aptly
                            represented in versions of the Uroboros in which the
                            serpent’s body is thick in its middle and thins out towards
                            its ends (see, for instance, Carl Jung, <hi rend="i">Psychology and
                                Alchemy, Collected Works</hi>, 2nd ed., Princeton: Princeton
                            University Press, 1970, XII, p. 103). The implied complementary serpent,
                            thickest where the serpent of nature is thinnest, and vice versa,
                            represents the spirit.</note>

                    <p>The cogency and centrality of the theme of Man’s fall from and
                        return to Eden in other work of Blake may be pointed out briefly, if
                        superficially. The title-page for the combined <hi rend="i">Songs of
                            Innocence and of Experience</hi> depicts Adam and Eve being turned out
                        of paradise: the first series consists of songs in which the joy of paradise
                        is remembered and expressed through correspondent symbols in this world; the
                        second series consists of songs in which eternity is forgotten, and Man
                        makes his bitter progress towards the point where hope of regeneration has
                        to be introduced. The 16 plates of <hi rend="i">The Gates of Paradise</hi>
                        emblematically tell the tale of travel through the fallen world, from the
                        exit gate of paradise round to the entrance gate. The early prophetic books
                        describe various portions of the journey. The myth of <hi rend="i">The Four
                            Zoas</hi> spans the entire <pb id="p12-191" n="191"/> cycle; this myth
                        is condensed and re-worked in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem. Milton</hi> focuses on
                        the apocalyptic event within the poet. Even in his incidental illustrations,
                        Blake frequently chose material related to the cycle, for instance, <hi rend="i">The Pilgrim’s Progress</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> and <hi rend="i">Paradise Regained.</hi> Judith
                        Rhodes has shown that the 12 illustrations to <hi rend="i">L’Allegro</hi> and <hi rend="i">Il Penseroso</hi> may be
                        arranged in a circular form with striking correspondences to the cycle we

                            the Last Judgment</hi> make a radical connection between the eternal
                        journey as a cycle of fall and return, and the eternal journey as the form
                        of Divine Humanity.<ref target="n72" type="note">26</ref> At the top of the
                        picture Jesus is shown seated on his throne in paradise. The fall takes
                        place on the right, in the form of figures falling downward. At the bottom,
                        beneath the "dragon’s cavern," lies Albion, who
                        is awakened by his wife. The resurrection into paradise is shown on the
                        left, in the form of figures moving upwards towards the throne of Jesus. We
                        are fortunate to have Blake’s description of a version of the
                        picture (E542-55, K442-44, 604-17), in which he emphasizes the mental nature
                        of his vision. For instance, the falling and rising figures, with biblical
                        names, are meant to represent "the States Signified by those Names
                        the Individuals being representatives or Visions of those States as they
                        were reveald to Mortal Man in the Series of Divine Revelations. as they are
                        written in the Bible these various States I have seen in my Imagination when
                        distant they appear as One Man but as you approach they appear Multitudes of
                        Nations" (<hi rend="i">VLJ</hi>, E546, K607). In the version of the
                        picture which is in the Rosenwald collection, the details of the picture do
                        dissolve into the outline of this "One Man."<ref target="n73" type="note">27</ref> Blake writes: "All Things are
                        comprehended in their Eternal Forms in the Divine body of the Saviour . . .
                        The Human Imagination who appeard to Me as Coming to Judgment . . . throwing
                        off the Temporal that the Eternal might be Established" (<hi rend="i">VLJ</hi>, E545, K605-06). The Last Judgment is thus viewed as a
                        process in which the divine spirit in Man leads him to discard the states of
                        error and to reach his eternal state, which forms his true home, the place

                        a circle. As in <hi rend="i">A Vision of the Last Judgment</hi>, the eternal
                        cycle is equally the human form. These motifs, along with that of the four
                        faces of Man, combine to make the Ezekiel design a comprehensive vision of
                        Man’s eternal form.</p>
                    <p>It is a symbolical reading of the Bible, as Blake’s own commentary
                        on <hi rend="i">A Vision of the Last Judgment</hi> suggests, that makes it
                        possible to interpret cohesively his most challenging works. Robinson
                        reports that Blake "warmly declared that all he knew was in the
                        Bible; but then he understands by the Bible the Spiritual Sense"
                        (BBR 322). Blake held that "The Old &amp; New Testaments are
                        the Great Code of Art" (<hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi>, E271,
                        K777). The biblical narrative, seized as a whole and transfigured into a
                        ballad, is complete and cohesive in "The Mental
                        Traveller." Any more restricted reading entails internal
                        contradictions or indicates interpretations contrary to Blake’s
                        distinct theological ideas. Because "The Mental Traveller"
                        is a radically compressed version of Blake’s most important
                        theme, that of Man’s fall from and return to Eden, and an
                        audacious announcement of reality’s mental nature, a mastery of
                        its form and its visionary conceit is, in microcosm, a mastery of Blake.</p>

                <p>In an interesting recent essay, Rodney M. and Mary R. Baine offer good evidence

                <p>In the same paragraph, however, lies a clue that, when followed up, provides the
                    definite evidence missing in the argument. The Baines, in suggesting that Blake
                    may have met Nicholson through the publisher Joseph Johnson, comment that Blake
                    in 1782 may have "engraved some of the twenty-five unsigned plates for
                    Nicholson’s <hi rend="i">An Introduction to Natural Philosophy</hi>,
                    published . . . by Johnson." Blake did in fact sign one of the plates
                    in this book, for the vignette used on the title-page of both volumes of the
                    first, 1782, edition (see illus. 1 for title-page) is unmistakably signed
                    "Blake sc," and there seems no doubt<ref target="n77" type="note">3</ref> that it was indeed William Blake the poet who engraved
                    this admittedly not very exciting temple of science in the clouds (illus. 2).
                    The same plate has been used for both volumes; it is small (the plate-mark
                    measures 81 × 44 mm.), and the signature (illus. 3) very small indeed
                    (approximately 3.5 mm.), and quite faint. The signature is in fact at least as
                    difficult to see as that on the small engraving by Blake on p. 127 of Vol. I of
                    Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Essays on Physiognomy</hi>, which managed to
                    escape detection for so many years.<ref target="n78" type="note">4</ref> This
                    does raise the possibility that Blake has placed other micro-signatures on
                    plates which have been seen often without recognition. Obviously engravers made
                    much use of magnifying lenses for their work, though Blake’s modest
                        myopia<ref target="n79" type="note">5</ref> may have helped a little. It is
                    not surprising that Blake adapted with great skill, if little enthusiasm, to the
                    craft of miniature painting. <note id="n77">
                        <hi rend="s">3</hi> The combination
                        of date, publisher, and style of signature make this virtually certain. I do
                        not know who designed the plate; it may have been Stothard, who designed
                        many of Blake’s early plates for Johnson, but a search through
                        the Stothard material in the British Museum Print Room failed to turn up any
                        evidence.</note>

                <p>The Baines’ essay suggests that Blake may have engraved some or all of
                    the other plates in these volumes. That is certainly possible, but in largely
                    technical engravings such as these are for the most part, it is impossible to
                    draw definite conclusions in the absence of clearly defined stylistic features.
                    The clumsy handling of the small temple on Plate XV of Vol. I, p. 281 (illus.
                    4), however, contrasts badly with the fineness of the basically similar temple
                    in Blake’s vignette. Blake is known to have done the technical
                    engravings for James Earle’s <hi rend="i">Practical Observations on
                        the Operation for the Stone</hi>,<ref target="n80" type="note">6</ref> but
                    they are again considerably finer than the work in the plates in the Nicholson
                    volumes. In fact, Blake’s commercial work in this early period was
                    usually small in scale and quite fine-toned, as demonstrated by such plates as
                    those for <hi rend="i">The Poetical Works of John Scott</hi> (1782), <hi rend="i">The Novelist’s Magazine</hi> (1782-83), and
                    Ritson’s <hi rend="i">Select Collection of English Songs</hi> (1783).
                    Blake himself later took some pride in this early work, much of it after
                    Stothard’s designs, and refers in the "Public
                    Address" to "those little prints which I engraved after him
                    five &amp; twenty years ago &amp; by which he got his reputation as a
                        draughtsman."<ref target="n81" type="note">7</ref> My own view
                    therefore is that it is relatively unlikely, though just possible, that Blake
                    engraved more than the title-page vignette for <hi rend="i">An Introduction to

                <p>The work was popular, and went through five English editions. "The

                    British Library’s copy the signature is almost invisible. It would
                    appear that the fine lines of Blake’s plate did not stand <pb id="p12-194" n="194"/> up to the heavy wear of substantial editions, for the
                    third, fourth, and fifth London editions, dated 1790, 1796, and 1805, substitute
                    a new and unsigned vignette (illus. 5) for the title-page, similar to
                    Blake’s in general outline but considerably coarser. I do not know
                    who made this later plate, but its style seems much too crude to be attributable
                    to Blake. <note id="n82">

                <p>There were also several American editions of Nicholson’s work, the
                    National Union Catalogue listing editions published in Philadelphia in 1787,
                    1788, and 1795-93 [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]. Of these I have seen only the edition
                    published in 1788 by Thomas Dobson; it is in one volume and is called
                    "The Third Edition." There is no engraving on the title-page;
                    most of the other plates in the book are extremely close but reversed copies of
                    the plates in the first London edition, suggesting that some process of tracing
                    was used to make the plates for the American editions.</p>
                <p>The uncovering of this overlooked Blake engraving is a useful reminder that Blake

                    be true in general terms, but it would seem that the two were far apart on
                    fundamental questions of method in the arts and sciences. Nicholson begins with
                    an "Introduction" that defines
                    "Demonstration" and gives three "Rules of
                    Philosophizing," in the following schematization: <q> I<lb/>

                    suggests that Blake may have thought of Nicholson as a type of the rationalizing
                    enlightenment mind intent upon narrowing philosophy to natural philosophy. <note id="n84">

                    with his dangerous toys and "magic pictures" of fleas and lice
                        (<hi rend="i">Island in the Moon</hi>, E 452-53). The Baines mention
                    Nicholson’s camera obscura in reference to Inflammable
                    Gass’s claim to own such a device (E 443). There is an illustration
                    of one in Nicholson’s book (my illus. 6), and a description:
                    "This is one of the most pleasing and delightful experiments in optics,
                    and never fails to strike the beholder with surprise and admiration. Which
                    indeed is not to be wondered at, for if there be any pleasure in contemplating a

                    aesthetics as unsatisfying as his natural philosophy. <note id="n86">

                    <p>Due to the generous help offered to us by the staff at the National Library
                        of Czechoslovakia (Praha) and at the Státní
                        Vědecká Knihovna (Olomouc) we have been able to trace
                        a number of translations of Blake’s works into Czech and
                        Slovakian, as well as several Slavic "Critical Studies" of
                        the poet-painter’s work. This material is listed here in
                        alphabetical, respectively chronological order, a few explanatory notes
                        being supplied in square brackets. We feel obliged, however, to warn our
                        readers as regards the accuracy of the bibliographical data. Not only did we
                        have to face the difficulties with the Slavic library and cataloging
                        conventions described by Prof. Bentley (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 41, 11
                        [1977], 50), but also time prevented proper examination of some of the
                        volumes. In these cases then, we had to rely entirely on the information
                        provided by the general catalogs at Praha and Olomouc.</p>
                    <p>On the whole, however, this short list seems to corroborate G. E. Bentley,
                        Jr.’s surmise that "especially [for the] Czech, Polish,
                        and Rumanian [languages], the Saltykov-Shchedrin [State Public Library,
                        Leningrad] is likely to be less comprehensive," and that more
                        material may well turn up on further investigation.</p>

                    <p>The Blake exhibition at the Tate, and the happy coincidence of a BBC Radio 4
                        serial, produced one discovery of interest, the subject of the hitherto
                        unidentified book illustration in the Bateson Collection.<ref target="n88" type="note">1</ref> In the "Times Diary" in <hi rend="i">The Times</hi> for 25 May 1978 it was reported that Professor
                        Noel McLachlan of Melbourne University had recognized the drawing as being
                        an illustration to Robert Bage’s <hi rend="i">Hermsprong, or Man
                            as He is Not</hi>, first published in 1796 and again in 1799, 1809, 1810
                        and 1828. The novel, subtitled to contrast it to Bage’s previous
                        novel <hi rend="i">Man as He is</hi> of 1792, deals with the opposition
                        between Lord Grondale and the radical Mr. Hermsprong, brought up in savage
                        America and a reader of Thomas Paine’s <hi rend="i">Rights of
                            Man</hi>; he is only revealed at the close to be Charles Campinet, the
                        wrongfully disinherited heir of Lord Grondale’s elder brother.

                    <p>The drawing shows the encounter in chapter 5 between Lord Grondale and
                        Hermsprong following the latter’s rescue of Lord
                        Grondale’s daughter Caroline Campinet and her aunt Mrs. Merrick
                        from being nearly "smashed to pieces down Lippen Crag"
                        after the horse pulling their "chair," a form of light
                        chaise, had bolted. Lord Grondale, who has not yet learned of the near
                        accident, is highly angry to find his niece "leaning on the bosom
                        of a young man. . . . Yet he did not knock the stranger down—he
                        did not. He only said, with the air of a great and angry man,
                        ‘Who are you, Sir?’" To this Hermsprong, a
                        "well dressed young man," replies at first with silence,
                        then with "I am a man, sir." When asked his rank and
                        fortune he replies, " . . . As to rank,—I have been
                        taught only to distinguish men by virtue," a sentiment that would
                        have appealed to Blake. Behind, Mrs. Merrick sits in the chair, still dazed
                        "with open eyes, which seemed not to see," while the
                        servant Philip holds the horse’s head. Blake has shown the
                        setting, "a steep declivity" running down to the river
                        Gron by which stands the village of Grondale; it is "a <figure>

                        monochrome pen and sepia and measures 6 ⅜ × 4 9/16
                        ins. (16.3 × 11.6 cm.), is close in style to Blake’s
                        illustrations to Milton’s <hi rend="i">L’Allegro</hi>
                        and <hi rend="i">Il Penseroso</hi> which are on paper watermarked 1816 and
                        may indeed date from even later, say <hi rend="i">c.</hi> 1820. It is just
                        possible, allowing for the fact that the book illustration is even more
                        accomplished in Blake’s late, sensuous manner than the Milton
                        illustrations, that it may have been done in connection with the 1828
                        edition of <hi rend="i">Hermsprong</hi>, which has a vignette frontispiece
                        by T. Williams showing the same episode. Blake’s more ambitious
                        design could have been abandoned as unsuitable or as the result of his death
                        in 1827. However, there is no documentary evidence for Blake’s
                        connection with this edition. (I am indebted to Professor McLachlan and Judy
                        Egerton for this identification and much of its elaboration
                        respectively.)</p>

                    <p>Cowper’s incidental poem, <hi rend="i">On the Death of Mrs.
                            Throckmorton’s Bullfinch</hi> (1789, 1792) offers a likely
                        source for a description in Blake’s <hi rend="i">A Poison
                            Tree</hi>, in the <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> (dated 1794). In
                        Blake’s poem the wrath of the speaker grows to bear "an
                        apple bright"; this is beheld by the envious
                        "foe" who—the last stanza relates—
                            <q> . . . into my garden stole,<lb/> When the night had veild the
                            pole;<lb/> In the morning glad I see;<lb/> My foe outstretched beneath
                            the tree. </q> In Cowper’s poem, "Bully"
                        leads a peaceful existence in his well-latticed cage, since his
                        "Dire foe" the cat is not permitted to live in the house.
                        Unfortunately, on one occasion his foe was a rat: <q> Night
                            veil’d the pole—all seem’d
                            secure—<lb/> When led by instinct sharp and sure,<lb/>
                            Subsistence to provide,<lb/> A beast forth-sallied on the scout,<lb/>
                            Long-back’d, long-tail’d, with
                            whisker’d snout,<lb/> And badger-colour’d
                            hide.<lb/>
                            <lb/> (31-36) </q> "Poor Bully’s
                        beak," like Orpheus’ head, is all that
                        "remain’d to tell / The cruel death he
                        died."</p>
                    <p>Blake’s adaption or unconscious echoing of this material is hardly
                        central to his poem, but it does offer further evidence of his early
                        attention to Cowper. The poem could have been seen by Blake on its first
                        appearance in the <hi rend="i">Gentleman’s Magazine</hi>,
                        February 1789; again in the <hi rend="i">Speaker</hi>, 1792; or possibly in
                        the offices of Joseph Johnson, who published it in the 1794-95 edition of

                        Harold Bloom has stated that the "Father of Jealousy . . . whom we
                        have met before in Blake as Winter, Tiriel, Restraint, the Devourer, and the
                        Nobodaddy who successfully masquerades as God the Father in <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>" is "first introduced in this
                        poem under his Blakean name of Urizen."<ref target="n89" type="note">1</ref> Moreover, while Oothoon and Theotormon, the doubtful
                        lovers, reappear in <hi rend="i">Europe a Prophecy</hi> and <hi rend="i">The
                            Song of Los</hi> and, along with the Daughters of Albion and Bromion, in

                        <ref target="n90" type="note">2</ref> Blake may have selected the names for their derivative
                        significance. For instance, Theotormon is nominally "the man
                        tormented by his own idea of God."<ref target="n91" type="note">3</ref> The name of Urizen, likewise, may suggest "the <hi rend="i">horizon</hi> of thought,"<ref target="n92" type="note">4</ref> as he and his agent try to restrain Oothoon’s
                        imagination, or, quite possibly, it may play upon the words "your
                        reason." However, another, more covert method of naming exists,

                    <p>Blake’s names, all original with this poem, are functions of their
                        first letters. That is, the poet started with the initial letters and then
                        found apt names to complete each letter, or character. These characters form
                        an anagram for "doubt" (<hi rend="u">D</hi>aughters, <hi rend="u">O</hi>othoon, <hi rend="u">U</hi>rizen, <hi rend="u">B</hi>romion, <hi rend="u">T</hi>heotormon). Indeed, the poem begins and
                        ends with doubt. The Daughters of Albion watch Oothoon’s progress
                        and doubt their ability to seize a similar freedom from Leutha’s
                        vale. Bromion assaults the exultant Oothoon and casts doubt upon the
                        validity of her so-called independence. Finally, Theotormon’s
                        conscience keeps him dubious of the love and sexual freedom to which Oothoon
                        wishes him to awake. Blake, then, reveals his poetic theme anagrammatically
                        through his names.</p>
                    <p>Certainly, doubt is a major theme in the poetry of William Blake. Plate 4,
                        "Air," of <hi rend="i">For the Sexes: The Gates of
                            Paradise</hi> shows a miserable character "On Cloudy Doubts and
                        Reasoning Cares";<ref target="n93" type="note">5</ref> moreover, in
                        the accompanying poem, Blake attacks "Doubt which is Self
                        contradiction" (E265). His "Auguries of
                        Innocence" warns: "He who shall teach the Child to Doubt /
                        The rotting Grave shall neer get out" (E483). One may think of the
                        Daughters, the children, of Albion in this connection. Urizen, the source of
                        all this doubt, may come to mind as well in Blake’s satiric
                        verse, "You dont believe I wont attempt to make ye"
                        (E492). Here the word "Doubt" is placed in the mouth of
                        Sir Isaac Newton, the scientist parodied by Blake in "The Ancient
                        of Days," who, in the frontispiece to <hi rend="i">Europe a
                            Prophecy</hi>, defines the "horizons of thought" with
                        his compass.<ref target="n94" type="note">6</ref> Doubt limits a person,
                        hinders him from becoming all he can be, and prevents him from drawing the
                        "distinct, sharp, . . . and wirey . . . bounding line"
                        (E540) by which he will live his own life. In <hi rend="i">Visions of the
                            Daughters of Albion</hi>, Blake places Urizen at the center of doubt,
                        both in a thematic and anagrammatical way. In fact, <hi rend="u">U</hi>rizen
                        and <hi rend="u">B</hi>romion act in the poem and in the anagram to separate
                        the <hi rend="u">D</hi>aughters and <hi rend="u">O</hi>othoon, the females,
                        from any consummation with <hi rend="u">T</hi>heotormon, the male. <note id="n93">

                    <p>This approach to the poem through anagram does not refute any of the previous
                        speculations about the derivations of the characters’ names. The
                        names of Theotormon, Bromion, and Oothoon, as Northrop Frye claims, may well
                        be Ossianic, in so oceanic a poem.<ref target="n95" type="note">7</ref> Yet
                        the focus on the anagram places the horse back before the cart. Blake
                        appears to have predetermined <pb id="p12-204" n="204"/> his thematic
                        anagram prior to his selection of suitable, properly lettered names from
                        Ossian or elsewhere. Furthermore, the word play seems to indicate the
                        presence of an eighteenth-century wit in Blake, even as he dealt with the
                        most Romantic of themes. <note id="n95">

                    <p>Comparatively few printings of Blake’s designs are known between
                        his death in 1827 and the revival of interest in him by

                    <p>The first is: <q> B. Hamilton. <hi rend="i">Gallery of British Artists</hi>,

                        the same Blake plates and descriptions of "Death’s
                        Door" "La Porte du Tombeau" (No. 181) and
                        "Death of the Strong Wicked Man" "Mort

                        </q> Plate X (12.1 × 20.8 cm) is
                        "Death’s-door" after W. Blake. There is no
                        accompanying text. The same plate, with the inscription altered, appeared in

                        book had a Blake plate.) Linton went on to make
                        "Facsimile" illustrations "from

                        According to Martin Butlin the drawing passed with others from Mrs. Blake to
                        Frederick Tatham, and it was in lot 170 at his sale on 29 April 1862, where
                        it was bought with five others for 14/-by Toovey for Henry Cunliffe.</p>
                    <p>One might ask why Blake’s early drawings have so often gone
                        unrecognized even in major collections. We can now appreciate their seminal
                        qualities and <pb id="p12-206" n="206"/>

                        that they are rather crude if compared to those of his contemporaries like
                        Stothard and Flaxman. Although Blake was not an autodidact, the originality
                        of the motifs tends to outstrip his mechanical abilities, which were
                        evidently not finely honed by constant drawing from the model. As a result
                        there are often embarrassing defects in Blake’s early drawings
                        which have led connoisseurs to dismiss them as inferior examples by one of
                        the many unidentified English Neoclassical artists of the late eighteenth
                        century. No doubt they will continue to turn up in odd places, and we might
                        well find among them more early prototypes for mature compositions.</p>

                    <p>The fame and influence of Blake’s designs to Blair’s
                            <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> (1808) are indicated in a modest way in <hi rend="i">The Pictorial Edition of The Book of Common Prayer</hi>
                            [1838],<ref target="n98" type="note">1</ref> generously pointed out to
                        me by my colleague Professor Peter Morgan. The work is remarkable for over
                        750 small woodcuts, mostly vignette capitals and rather larger chapter
                        headings. The engravings are anonymous, but the authorship of most of the
                        designs is attributed in the "List of Illustrations" to
                        artists such as Raffaelle, Rubens, Tintoretto, and Lebrun, with a scattering
                        of more recent designers such as Reynolds, Westall, and Flaxman (eight
                        designs, chiefly from his <hi rend="i">Lord’s Prayer</hi> [1835]
                        ). The only Blake in the "List" is on p. 192:
                        "Initial letter—Christ with the keys of Hell and
                        Death.—Blake" (3.5 × 4.0 cm). The design
                        (illus. 1 here) is made so small and conventional as to be scarcely
                        recognizable as Blake’s for the plate called "Christ
                        descending into the Grave" (see illus. 2); the focus on Christ is
                        diminished, the facial features are made simpler and conventional, and the
                        distracting horizontal and diagonal lines of the capital
                        "A" entirely alter the force of Blake’s design.

                    <p>Far more interesting is the border to the design of Rubens’
                        "Resurrection" (illus. 3) serving as the headpiece to
                        "The Collect" on p. 199 (11.0 × 13.7 cm). The
                        border is not identified in the "List of Illustrations,"
                        but it is unmistakably taken from the engraved titlepage to
                        Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> (illus. 4) and the design of
                        "The Death of The Good Old Man" (illus. 5) for
                        Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave.</hi> At the bottom of the border is
                        the skeleton faithfully copied (reversed) from the Blair titlepage. To the
                        right is the plunging trumpeter from the Blair titlepage, with clouds added
                        at the bottom and some trailing drapery obscuring his genitals. (The hands
                        and feet are somewhat altered from Blake.) At the left is the same figure,
                        reversed, with some added background clouds and the tactful omission of the
                        genitals. At the top are the two angels conducting the soul of The Good Old
                        Man to heaven, fairly carefully repeated, reversed, from "The Death
                        of The Good Old Man" (illus. <figure>
                            <head>2 "Christ descending into the Grave" designed by

                        at their call at the bottom, and at the top we see two other angels (or
                        perhaps the same ones having sprouted wings) carrying a man (the resurrected
                        and newly fleshed and bearded skeleton?) to heaven. The method <pb id="p12-208" n="208"/>

                    <p>Blake’s designs to Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> were
                        printed in 1808 (twice), 1813, and 1826, but since in all printings before
                        1830 the designs were scarcely altered, it is not possible to say which
                        edition was being copied in the 1838 <hi rend="i">Common Prayer.</hi> The
                        1838 borders do, however, bear one striking similarity to the new editions
                        of Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> of 1847 and 1858 with new
                        plates after Blake engraved by A. L. Dick. In Dick’s version of
                        the Blair titlepage, the plunging trumpeter is delicately draped with a wisp
                        of unattached diaphonous veil, as in the 1838 design. James Montgomery, who
                        subscribed to the 1808 edition of Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>, found that "several of the plates were hardly of such
                        a nature as to render the book proper to lie on a parlour table for general
                        inspection," and Robert Hunt complained in <hi rend="i">The
                            Examiner</hi> for 7 August 1808 that "an appearance of
                        libidinousness [<hi rend="i">in the Blair designs</hi>] intrudes itself upon
                        the holiness of our thoughts."<ref target="n99" type="note">2</ref>
                        Regency and Victorian sensibility evidently required changes in
                        Blake’s vision, and in the 1838, 1847, and 1858 versions of
                        Blake’s titlepage for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>
                        the trumpeter seems to have stooped to truth and moralized his song. <note id="n99">

                        of his Irish grandparentage, his sojourn in a madhouse, and the more

                        Christianity, with the help of a quietly sententious village rector, and it
                        concludes with all well in the Moat House: <q> It was the reign of rest and
                            peace; that time to which many hearts are looking, a time when the work
                            of life is over, and there is a tarrying and reposing before the break
                            of endless day.<lb/> (p. 204) </q>

                    <p>It’s a good tale, set in 1796 and woven around William and
                        Catherine Blake, a runaway apprentice named Ben Pendrill who needs
                        befriending, and a grubby old man named Grale who spies for a living.</p>
                    <p>The year 1796 is right for the politics although wrong for <hi rend="i">Songs

                    <p>The Blakes actually did assist a young artist, though in different

                    <p>We meet members of the real world of William Blake, including Mr. Godwin,
                        Miss Wollstonecraft, Mr. Parker, Mr. Stothard, Mr. Moser (d. 1783), and
                        especially Mr. Flaxman and Mr. Butts. With the assistance of John Flaxman,
                        "Muster-Master General" Thomas Butts takes Blake
                        "under [<hi rend="i">his</hi>] protection" (pp. 103, 105)
                        and thus deflects the thought-police from him.</p>
                    <p>Often the dialogue is plausibly Blakean: <q> ‘Do you still attend
                            that church, the one with the strange beliefs?’ Godwin
                            asked.<lb/>
                            <lb/> ‘The Church of Swedenborg? Occasionally.
                            Their beliefs are not strange enough for us these days.’
                            William’s face was expressionless but his voice was light,
                            almost mocking. (p. 13) </q> Later Blake says to Stothard: <q>
                            ‘ . . . you speak of the new age; I tell you this, Sir, these
                            changes, and any others in the world, are without meaning unless men are
                            changed in their hearts and learn to live in
                            eternity.’<lb/>
                            <lb/> Parker was indignant. ‘Live
                            in eternity? Come, Mr. Blake. This is close to
                            priest-craft.’<lb/>
                            <lb/> ‘Those words do not
                            frighten me,’ William said. ‘We hear too much of
                            priest-craft in these days. Let us hear a little more of soldier-craft,
                            or business-craft, or politician-craft. I tell you that all ages are the
                            same, but that genius is above the age.’ (p. 47) </q>
                    </p>
                    <p>The story is, of course, about a boy, and Carter often sketches the
                        relationship of Blake and Ben deftly. When Ben first arrives, Blake shows
                        him a woodcut: <q> He took an inked roller and ran it over the wood. Then he
                            placed a strip of paper over the wood and pressed it down. When he took
                            the paper away there was an animal on it.<lb/>
                            <lb/> Ben whistled in
                            surprise. ‘It’s a dog,’ he
                            said.<lb/>
                            <lb/> William was slightly offended.
                            ‘It’s a lamb,’ he said. ‘Do
                            you know what a lamb is?’<lb/>
                            <lb/>
                            ‘No.’ Ben didn’t.<lb/>
                            <lb/>
                            ‘Well, that is one,’ William said firmly, but he
                            stole another glance at the sketch as he put it down. (pp. 17-18) </q>
                    </p>
                    <p>At the end, Mr. Grale the spy, abandoned by his secret police paymaster and
                        left to his rather horrible self, is taken in by the Blakes, to
                        Ben’s astonishment, and Ben himself is apprenticed to Mr. Fox the
                        engraver, his sixty-guinea fee being paid by Thomas Butts.</p>
                    <p>The story presents a loving and sensitive relationship amongst the Blakes and
                        their young friend Ben. Blake’s poems, visions, and ideas are
                        seen through Ben and his reactions in a believable way. The unfolding of
                        William’s generosity of spirit and deed with Mr. Grale is
                        especially satisfying to the sentimental reader. Peter Carter’s
                            <hi rend="i">Gates of Paradise</hi> is interesting reading for the way
                        it presents and interprets William Blake and is rewarding for more than the
                        story to young readers.</p>

                    <p>Readers of this journal are well aware of the quantity and complexity of
                        studies related to Blake. They are probably also aware that the rapid
                        proliferation of these often recondite monographs tends to build a wall
                        around Blake, cutting him off from the general public and even from the
                        interested but non-specialist student. It is necessary that this wall be
                        breached periodically if Blake is not to become a remote cult image,
                        familiar only to a coterie of initiates. Morton Paley’s Phaidon
                            <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi> is a praiseworthy attempt to provide
                        this access for people who are not inside the camp of regular Blakeans.</p>
                    <p>The book is physically well-designed for its purpose. Produced in the normal
                        Phaidon monograph format, it consists of sixty-four pages of text with
                        forty-seven text illustrations; a section of one hundred and sixteen plates
                        with fifteen in color; a convenient chronology; a glossary; and a separate
                        section of notes on the plates. The plates are of fine quality; the text is
                        spaciously printed; the book is a pleasure to handle.</p>
                    <p>To provide a brief, general introduction to Blake that is also valid is a
                        formidable task. Ideally the person undertaking it should be a Blake
                        specialist, familiar with the enormous literature on the man, but at the
                        same time able to extricate himself sufficiently from this terrain to map
                        its general contours clearly for the non-specialist. He should be equally at
                        home with the visual and verbal components of Blake’s art, and
                        familiar with the currents of late eighteenth century thought, history, and
                        culture with which Blake came in contact. Paley comes close to being such a
                        paragon, although he is perhaps too much the specialist to be sensitive to
                        every point at which the layman and non-specialist need guidance.</p>
                    <p>Paley chooses a biographical framework for his text, but allows himself
                        sufficient flexibility to discuss coherent topics within that framework.
                        It’s a sensible solution to the problem of organization that
                        works well for the task at hand. There are ten sections: (1)
                        Blake’s early life, training, and work down to 1790. (2) The
                        Lambeth books, to the mid-1790s (this is the longest section). (3) The
                        color-printed monotypes, and illustrations to <hi rend="i">Night
                            Thoughts</hi> and Gray. (4) The Felpham episode. (5) Return to London,
                            <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, Canterbury Pilgrims. (6) Blake’s
                        thoughts on art. (7) Bible illustrations. (8) <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and
                        the illustrations to Milton’s poems. (9) <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> (10) Job and Dante. A large amount of information is
                        packed into the text; there is no significant aspect of Blake’s
                        work of potential interest to the non-specialist that is not touched on.</p>
                    <p>Ideally the person to measure the success of the book should be a member of
                        the audience to whom it is presumably directed, the interested layman with
                        no special knowledge of Blake or his art. The present reviewer is an art
                        historian, concerned with Blake in the general context of Georgian art, but
                        not a Blake specialist. I find it interesting that Paley, who is an
                        historian of literature, gives more of his text to an explication of the
                        visual than the verbal side of Blake. He provides what I find a clear,
                        consistently well-informed account of Blake’s artistic training,
                        of his affiliations with older artists (such as Barry, Fuseli, and Mortimer)
                            <pb id="p12-212" n="212"/> and with those of his own generation (such as
                        Flaxman and Stothard). His remarks on Blake’s frequently complex
                        technical procedures are brief but lucid. The section on Blake’s
                        theory of art is unusually well-balanced and perceptive, especially in
                        assessing Blake’s thought relative to Reynolds’s.
                        Furthermore, I find it reasurring to read a Blake specialist who is aware of
                        his hero’s limitations as an artist and does not feel obliged to
                        justify or explain away these weaknesses. There should be more on the
                        general stylistic and formal affiliations of Blake’s art, how
                        Blake relates to the general currents of late eighteenth century British and
                        European art. But this aside, Paley seems to me to do an admirable job of
                        telling the interested layman what he will want to know about the visual
                        side of Blake. The bulk of the text is devoted to explanations of individual
                        plates and designs. Paley also demonstrates the various ways in which the
                        visual and verbal interrelate in the illuminated books, choosing a series of
                        plates from <hi rend="i">America</hi> as the primary vehicle for this
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>I did not find a comparable overview of the verbal component of Blake. Paley
                        seems to assume a much broader knowledge of late eighteenth century British
                        poetry in general and of Blake’s poetry in particular than he
                        does for the visual side. Nor did I find any general assessment of
                        Blake’s intellectual position relative to his contemporaries. The
                        text is richly sprinkled with penetrating remarks on both these matters. But
                        they nearly all deal with particulars—the interpretation of an
                        individual page or verse. There are illuminating paragraphs on
                        Blake’s relations with the Swedenborgians. There is nearly always
                        a helpful sentence or two about the theme of a particular poem. But the
                        interested layman looking for guidelines in approaching the verbal component
                        of Blake’s art will find less than for the visual. Obviously
                        Paley is well qualified to supply this information. That it is not there may
                        be the result of unconscious assumptions concerning the audience for the
                        book. Or perhaps the expected audience is students of literature already
                        familiar with the verbal side of Blake, seeking a guide to the visual. I
                        think the book meets admirably the needs of this last group, but is not yet
                        the ideal answer for those unfortunates totally beyond the pale.</p>

                    <p>The eighteenth century in artistic terms did not stop in 1800. Crucial ideas
                        were still developing and flourishing well into the nineteenth century. The
                        period about 1800 was one of artistic excitement, as well as a time of
                        literary and political upheavals. Neoclassicism, the main movement or style,
                        was only in the middle of its second phase about 1800; the final, third
                        stage had yet to emerge. This fact was recognized by the organizers of the
                        "Age of Neoclassicism" exhibition held in London in 1972;
                        they gave themselves a brief covering the period up to 1840. The other main
                        umbrella often used to cover the late eighteenth and the early nineteenth
                        centuries is obviously that of Romanticism. That interesting show in Detroit
                        and Philadelphia in 1968, "Romantic Art in Britain," was
                        devoted to the century between 1760 and 1860. Although these dates were
                        arguably a bit too far apart, especially at the latter end, it was a fault
                        in the right direction.</p>
                    <p>Yet for chronological convenience the editors of the Oxford History of
                        English Art and the Pelican History of Art have chosen either 1800 or 1790
                        as terminal dates when commissioning eighteenth-century studies. At least in
                        the Pelican series the British sculpture and architecture volumes by
                        Margaret Whinney and John Summerson go as far as 1830, but the painting
                        survey by Ellis Waterhouse stops in <pb id="p12-213" n="213"/> 1790. For a
                        continuation into the nineteenth century in the Pelican series we await
                        Michael Kitson’s volume. In the Oxford series we have T. S. R.
                        Boase’s volume, which covers the first seventy years after 1800.
                        In this instance a terminal date of 1870 makes sense, but that is another
                        story not for discussion here.</p>
                    <p>Burke seems to hint at the difficulty of his concluding date in the final
                        paragraph of his book. Discussing Wordsworth, in a chapter entitled
                        "The Transition to Romanticism," Burke writes that the
                        poet, "who disliked the picturesque and described it in <hi rend="i">The Prelude</hi> as ‘ . . . a strong infection of
                        the age. . . . / Bent overmuch on superficial things’, has in
                        these two passages identified the dividing line between the Rule of Taste
                        and the liberty of nature, crossed by artists as well as poets <hi rend="i">well before</hi> the close of the century in which he spent the first
                        thirty years of his life" (my italics).</p>
                    <p>Not only do the dates of 1790 or 1800 distort what was actually happening in
                        the art world, it also cuts through the careers of major artists whose lives
                        happen to span the end and the beginning of the centuries. This is of course
                        inevitable with any date that is selected at any period. But in the case of
                        these standard histories there are some unfortunately truncated artists
                        whose two halves never seem to meet each other, apparently leading separate
                        lives, and reminding one of the two halves of the <hi rend="i">Visconte
                            dimezzato</hi> in Italo Calvino’s fairy tale.</p>
                    <p>In the context of this periodical, it will be appropriate to start by looking
                        at the results of editorial policy in the Oxford series on the career of
                        William Blake. In Burke’s volume he is mentioned on four
                        occasions. In an excellent chapter devoted to "The Royal Academy
                        and the Great Style" Blake appears, along with Turner, as one of
                        the painters whose imaginations were "haunted all their lives by
                        themes of <hi rend="i">istoria.</hi>" Later in the same chapter,
                        whilst discussing James Barry’s paintings at the Society of Arts,
                        Burke says that the Irishman lacked the "mystic fervour"
                        of Blake, a fair comparison since Barry could on occasions be singularly
                        earthbound. Still in the same chapter, whilst mentioning single-handed
                        undertakings to illustrate the works of famous authors, Burke mentions
                        Fuseli’s Milton Gallery and Blake’s Dante project. The
                        only other citation of Blake is in a chapter on "The Expansion of
                        Neo-Classicism," where Burke quotes from the 1809 <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue.</hi> Each of the references is apposite, but the
                        main discussion of Blake does not occur until Boase’s volume.</p>
                    <p>Some of the other artists who have suffered similarly by being torn between
                        two volumes include John Flaxman. His early period, embracing commissions
                        for Wedgwood and major works in the 1790’s, features in Burke,
                        but later works have had to be omitted and appear in Boase. As a result, in
                        neither volume is Flaxman’s overall development discussed
                        properly. Fuseli hardly comes into Burke at all. Sir Thomas Lawrence and
                        Thomas Rowlandson are omitted. Sir Henry Raeburn, a fine portraitist who is
                        much underrated in the general literature, appears on only one page in
                        Burke, and is also scantily treated by Boase, and is therefore virtually
                        omitted by both authors. Of the principal artists at the turn of the century
                        one of the few to receive anything like adequate coverage is Benjamin West.
                        But like Flaxman his oeuvre as a whole is unsatisfactorily treated.</p>
                    <p>Editorial decisions over dates are one matter, the actual content of Joseph
                        Burke’s volume is quite another. It is a brilliantly skillful
                        compression within four hundred pages of a great deal of material and
                        especially valuable since it discusses all the arts, including gardening and
                        the decorative arts, within the covers of one book—a virtue of
                        editorial policy, since this is a characteristic of all the Oxford History
                        of English Art series. Too often in art historical literature, painting,
                        sculpture and architecture are discussed in isolation from each other, and
                        the decorative arts are usually squeezed out or given a mere nod. Art
                        historians, with a few exceptions, have been such snobs over the decorative
                        arts in the post-medieval period, relegating research on
                        them—quite wrongly—to a lower order of intellectual
                        activity. The barrier between the so-called "fine" arts
                        and the rest is only a recent invention, for which Michelangelo is partially
                        to blame. It is a barrier which did not exist in the eighteenth century,
                        since artists like Robert Adam and Flaxman were not alone in designing in
                        several fields. Across the Channel, the decorative arts were of crucial
                        importance in contemporary France, and an integral part of the artistic
                        creativity of the time, yet they are omitted from the Pelican History of Art
                        volume by Wend Graf Kalnein and Michael Levy, thus diminishing its
                        usefulness.</p>
                    <p>It was particularly encouraging therefore to open Burke’s volume
                        and find amongst the plates a double-page spread showing a Rococo staircase
                        in a country-house in Devon opposite a Rococo design for a table and a
                        silver wine cooler. The plates in general are in fact refreshingly
                        unhackneyed. Other plates include a Roubiliac monument opposite a Paul de
                        Lamerie ewer; and a Robert Adam staircase opposite a sideboard and other
                        furnishings designed by him. Such juxtapositions make a fuller and deeper
                        understanding of the whole period possible, in a way that cannot be achieved
                        in volumes devoted to the arts separately. Some styles cannot be discussed
                        adequately without taking all the arts into account; this is especially the
                        case with the Rococo and with Neoclassicism.</p>
                    <p>Burke has some particularly good passages on the decorative arts. His
                        discussion of the "Impact of the Rococo" in his fifth
                        cahpter is a model of its kind, in which the essential interweaving of all
                        the arts in the eighteenth century is very apparent, embracing also
                        literature and music. The author had given a foretaste of his ideas in an
                        interesting article published in <hi rend="i">Eighteenth-Century
                            Studies</hi> in 1969, entitled "Hogarth, Handel and Roubiliac:
                        a note on the interrelationship of the arts in England 1730-1760."
                        In the same spirit Jean Hagstrum had written his important <hi rend="i">Sister Arts</hi> (Chicago Univ. Press, 1958) and more recently Morris
                        Brownell has <pb id="p12-214" n="214"/> published his <hi rend="i">Alexander
                            Pope and the Arts of Georgian England</hi> (Oxford Univ. Press, 1978).
                        Ronald Paulson has produced some particularly stimulating articles on art
                        written from the vantage point of an historian of English literature, often
                        giving a refreshing new look at eighteenth-century Britain. Some of his
                        articles on art have been usefully gathered together under the title of <hi rend="i">Emblem and Expression</hi> (Harvard Univ. Press, 1975). Within
                        this growing awareness of interrelationships, Burke firmly places the
                        silver, ceramics and furnishings of the period. The more boundaries that are
                        broken down between the arts, and in many instances between disciplines
                        themselves, the better. For a masterly new look at all the arts in
                        eighteenth-century Britain, Burke’s book is to be greatly
                        welcomed and much valued.</p>
                    <p>As Britain has so often since the medieval period been a follower rather than
                        a leader in the arts within a European context, the eighteenth century is an
                        especially creative period. British contributions were of major importance
                        in the areas of landscape-gardening and of Neoclassicism. Although one
                        recent scholar would like to take Britain’s lead away from her by
                        saying that the "picturesque" garden was invented in
                        France (heretical and unconvincing view!), any study of British art in the
                        eighteenth century must have a great deal to say on the subject of both
                        landscape gardening as well as landscape painting. Such a discussion must be
                        interdisciplinary, and Paulson in his collected essays almost inevitably has
                        a piece on "The Poetic Garden," starting with a walk at
                        Castle Howard. Burke, on the other hand, starts his discussion with theory,
                        with Shaftesbury and Pliny. Within less than thirty pages, Burke manages to
                        squeeze in all the essentials, in an area of research that is now at last
                        being developed, having lain largely dormant since Christopher
                        Hussey’s <hi rend="i">magnum opus.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>As one would expect in a history of this kind, Burke discusses all the main
                        artists and a surprisingly large number of minor ones as well. He is able,
                        because he is looking at all the arts, to discuss Hogarth and Roubiliac in
                        the same chapter; he naturally gives prominence to Reynolds; and he has much
                        to say of interest about the development of architecture from the Palladians
                        onwards. The only shift in the balance of priorities that I would like to
                        have seen was more space devoted to Allan Ramsay, whose portaits are just as
                        fine as—and occasionally finer than—those of either
                        Reynolds or Gainsborough. Indeed in eighteenth-century studies in general,
                        Gainsborough is in danger of being overrated. It is unfortunate that Ramsay
                        is only allocated one plate, and that of the unusually dull portrait of the
                        third Duke of Argyll.</p>
                    <p>Other reviewers have already pointed out that the long delay in the
                        publication of the manuscript, finished in 1973, with parts completed even
                        earlier, has meant that recent books and articles—although in
                        some instances mentioned by the author—were not available for the
                        main writing. The delay has also meant that minor details have not been
                        updated, of which only two instances will be cited. We now know more about
                        the mysterious Mr. Lightfoot responsible for the delightful Chinoiserie
                        decorations in Claydon House, including even his Christian name. Amongst the
                        plates, it would have been better to have included a more recent photograph
                        of the Library at Kenwood. The later bookcases on either side of the
                        fireplace have now been removed, and replaced by a very successful
                        reconstruction of Adam’s original mirrors, which has given the
                        room an additional vitality in their reflecting light. But all such outdated
                        information can easily be remedied in a second edition.</p>
                    <p>Overall, the author has written an immensely useful and indispensible working
                        tool for anyone studying the eighteenth century. As Burke’s
                        volume is conceived quite differently from the rival Pelican series, he has
                        provided the kind of book for which there has long been a need.</p>

                    <p>This book contains the six Clark Lectures delivered at Cambridge University
                        in 1976, with thirty-five pages of notes and eleven photographs of
                        architecture and memorials illuminating the points at issue. The first
                        lecture charts the field. From Milton to the present, the writer searches
                        for evidences of culture as these have changed. Primary consideration is
                        given to esthetic patterns, proclivities and values. Two other questions are
                        never far from the mind: political groupings and patterns of behavior; and
                        religious groupings, beliefs and patterns of worship. At the close of the
                        last lecture Mr. Davie remarks: "Some day I may stray from my
                        proper field so far as to challenge certain received notions about the
                        social and political history of the English Dissent over the past three
                        centuries." These fields also are at least foreshadowed in the
                        present publication.</p>
                    <p>Isaac Watts is the central figure of the second lecture, "Old
                        Dissent, 1700-1740." Two lines of relationship are traced, between
                        the work of Watts and Calvinist ideals of art on the Continent, those
                        artistic ideals of simplicity, sobriety, and measure, manifested in
                        Watts’s ability to subordinate parts to the whole conception in a
                        form of classicism so different from that of Pope that the speaker calls it
                        "non-English." The other relation is to Hebrew poetry.
                        Because the Old Dissent thought of itself as a chosen people living in
                        tension with neighbors, Watts was "a poet of the tribal lay, a true
                        analogue in Augustan England of David."</p>
                    <p>"Dissent and the Wesleyans, 1740-1800" first considers the
                        lapsed Quaker, Matthew Green, whose poem <hi rend="i">The Spleen</hi>
                        comments with rueful wit upon the changes from the time of George Fox to the
                        day when the Quakers entered into the Industrial Revolution. <hi rend="i">The Spleen</hi> was admired by Pope and Walpole and Gray; admired also
                        by Johnson as wit, but not as poetry, and he did not include Green in the
                            <hi rend="i">Lives of the Poets.</hi> But Johnson would not omit Isaac
                        Watts; he said nothing about the hymns (Johnson did not approve of hymns),
                        and little about Watts as a poet, but praised him as man, as prose writer
                        and especially as teacher. Watts and the Wesleys are the central figures,
                        not that the Wesleys dissented from the Church, but because their followers
                        did. The questions of "offensive" sexuality and masochism
                        are raised here, and one is reminded that the dignified and decorous Dr.
                        Watts was accused of such faults, as well as the extravagant Moravians.</p>
                    <p>The "Old Dissent" is represented by Robert Hall, Baptist
                        minister, in the fourth lecture, "Dissent and the Evangelicals,
                        1800-1850." Hall, because dissenters could not be members of the
                        University, was not quite "every inch a Cambridge man,"
                        but his love of Cambridge, and of scholarship, and of his friend Samuel Parr
                        almost qualify him for that description. The New Dissent, Unitarians and
                        Sandemanians, has Mrs. Elizabeth Gaskell for the Unitarian representative.
                        The Unitarians, the intellectual <hi rend="i">élite</hi> of the
                        Dissent, contributed to culture ideas, argument, speculative thought rather
                        than works of art, and Mrs. Gaskell with her novels "is probably
                        the nearest we can come to an exception to this rule." The
                        Sandemanians are represented by the great scientist Michael Faraday. His
                        popular lectures on science were a major source of income for the Royal
                        Institute, and his love of the theater and novels and poetry enlivened these
                        lectures, eloquent and energetic in style. The style of his sermons (he was
                        an elected Elder) contrasts with the lectures, being "patient and
                        formal exposition." He had been too poor to have any academic
                        training. He had educated himself from <hi rend="i">The Improvement of the
                            Mind</hi> by Watts and his first publication was on that book. Faraday
                        alone would go far to justify Johnson’s praise of
                        Watts’s book; and as for Watts, it should <pb id="p12-216" n="216"/> be glory enough for any teacher to have educated
                        Faraday—even, or perhaps especially—posthumously.</p>
                    <p>Lecture V, "Dissent and the Agnostics, 1850-1900," tells of
                        the "loss of faith," in particular, George Eliot and
                        Leslie Stephen. Many arguments with the two Arnolds, father and son, are
                        brought into the discussion. Chiefly considered is their allegation that the
                        Dissent had abandoned all cultural responsibilities. "Mark
                        Rutherford" is compared with André Gide in a very
                        illuminating discussion. The villain of this lecture is the evangelist
                        Charles Spurgeon, whose effect upon the Dissent was
                        "disastrous."</p>
                    <p>The sixth lecture, "Dissent in the Present Century," takes
                        D. H. Lawrence as its battleground, the opponents being T. S. Eliot against
                        F. R. Leavis. Eliot held in contempt Lawrence’s Chapel
                        background; Leavis defended it on the grounds that it was "the
                        center of a strong social life." It seems to Mr. Davie, for all
                        that, that this background failed Lawrence, just as the background of
                        Dissent failed to sustain W. H. White. But the tradition did not wholly fail
                        Edmund Gosse. <hi rend="i">Father and Son</hi> demonstrates this fact, and
                        "one of the great and unexpected virtues of Gosse’s
                        beautifully tender book is the proof it gives of how a culture and a
                        tradition were transmitted even within a sect so late-come and so rigid as
                        that of the Plymouth Brethren."</p>
                    <p>If I were competent to do so, I should set this book beside the work of
                        another poet and critic, Matthew Arnold. I am not. I have given a rather
                        drab summary, which stands in relation to the book itself as a <hi rend="i">précis</hi> of a libretto stands in relation to its musical
                        drama. Only major characters and plot line. But I can at least mention the
                        music.</p>
                    <p>From the printed page there comes the sound of a voice, luminous and just.
                        The thematic construction takes its ground bass from the heroic age of
                        Milton and Bunyan. The action begins when the Hanoverians made the Dissent a
                        part of the bourgeois culture. One major theme is stated in "O God,
                        our help in ages past," the need of Establishment and Dissent for
                        one another; the song is used in Establishment ceremonies in England, Canada
                        and America. Another song by Watts introduces a major theme, "We
                        are a garden." It is part of Watts’s only song cycle,
                        made from The Song of Solomon, and as that book has virtually been removed
                        from the canon, so are Watts’s songs almost unknown. The charge
                        of "offensive sexuality" is part of the theme, and another
                        part is the celebration of the Lord’s Supper. This particular
                        song describes the careful and loving preparation for the sacrament and the
                        invitation to the Spirit to come, now that all has been made ready. With the
                        song come thoughts of a real garden where Watts was a guest for more than
                        thirty years, a decorous eighteenth-century garden. Here he walked and sang
                        with the Wesleys, and said that one song by Charles Wesley was worth more
                        than all of his own. And so this song is next quoted, "Wrestling
                        Jacob," on the great paradoxes involved in the wounding of God and
                        Man, of victory in defeat.</p>
                    <p>Thus the eloquent tongue of Mr. Davie evokes the very times as they pass in
                        historical succession. Sometimes that tongue is in his cheek. The lecture on
                        the late nineteenth century opens (appropriately) with something like a
                        Gilbert and Sullivan patter song on the divisions among the Baptists. A
                        Gathered Church, indeed! Sectarianism with a vengeance! And, appropriate to
                        that era, <hi rend="i">The Importance of Being Earnest</hi> comes to mind;
                        Froude and Stephen sound rather like Lady Bracknell. Sacred poetry and
                        religious fictions have no place in literature at all. Ah, so? Well, that
                        disposes of Milton and Bunyan. Bunyan, in fact, is "the
                        Poet-apostle of the English Middle-Class imperfectly educated like
                        himself." How delightful to contemplate the perfection of
                        one’s own education, and, of course, one’s two good
                        addresses.</p>
                    <p>In the lecture, a poem by Tyutchev sounds with grief for loss, the loss of
                        faith, the loss of belief in the efficacy of prayer. The lecture closes in
                        contrasting tone, Samuel Butler’s satiric celebration of Charles
                        Spurgeon in his flamboyant vulgarity; and in the satire there is still the
                        sound of grief for something lost.</p>
                    <p>I take issue with two statements about Blake. I am reluctant to do so for
                        readers who may not have Mr. Davie’s book at hand, for his tone
                        is quite as important as I represent it to be, and in both cases, it is the
                        tone I dispute, not the facts stated. My ears are notoriously better than
                        the brain between them; but they may not be infallible. Of
                        Blake’s <hi rend="i">Mystery</hi>, he says: "this term
                        that the prayer book gives to the sacrament is consistently a term of
                        abuse" (p. 98). So far as I recall, that is true. But Blake was not
                        working from the prayer book. His most celebrated Mystery is from
                        Revelation, used at the close of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> as St. John
                        used it, an evil female. The Tree of Mystery is associated with the
                        sacrament in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> (Night VII, p. 80). Urizen
                        compels his exhausted daughters to knead the fruit of the Tree into bread
                        for a parody of a communion service and preaches a "communion
                        sermon" that should have brought down upon him the
                        "Woes" of Matthew 23 and the special
                        "Woes" in 1 Corinthians 11:27 &amp; 29. Blake, for
                        about ten years, from 1795 was bitter in his comments on an Establishment
                        that used its authority to support wars. And, in another context, Mr. Davie
                        himself gives proof that the "daughters" were reluctant to
                        take part in the sacrament: in St. Paul’s Cathedral, Easter 1800,
                        there were six communicants (p. 64).</p>
                    <p>It is true (p. 52) that Blake found no sustenance in any organized religion.
                        His Mr. Huffcap could stand in for Spurgeon with his vulgar ranting. But
                        Blake saw no good in any other sort of organization, school, art academy,
                        nothing suited him. During a time when London’s organized
                        charities drew praise from the Continent, Blake had no part in them, and
                        even "Holy Thursday" has been interpreted as an expression
                        of his contempt for such works. Hogarth, quite a different sort of man,
                        opened London’s first art gallery in support of that charity and
                        served with Handel on the board. Yet Blake apparently was not uncharitable
                        by nature, nor does all of this add up to Blake’s holding in
                        contempt the true Bread and Wine that images the broken body and spilt
                        blood. Lord David Cecil’s life of Samuel Palmer describes that
                        group of young men who made Blake’s last years <pb id="p12-217" n="217"/> happy. They were devout, intellectually sophisticated to
                        various degrees, able to construe Blake’s poems and his pictures,
                        two of them artists, one of the two a great artist. They accepted
                        Blake’s special relation with Milton, and they established his
                        special relation with Bunyan. They met at The House of the Interpreter. I am
                        content to rest on their opinion.</p>
                    <p>I am not in agreement with another of Mr. Davie’s opinions. The
                        whole long passage (p. 53 f.) is relevant. The gist is that one may admire
                        Blake "and still regard with alarm, as a very ominous symptom, the
                        veneration which is now so freely accorded him." Mr. Davie spoke in
                        1976. For some years prior to that date, I had cause to think quite the
                        contrary. I was living in a chancy and fascinating era in the history of
                        education, every newspaper announcing some lower level of literacy and some
                        higher estimate of the number of hours out of twentyfour that my students
                        spent watching television commercials. The spontaneous interest of students
                        in Blake was like money in the bank. Blake is, as Mr. Davie says, an
                        "engaging" creature. <hi rend="i">Engaging</hi> is
                        precisely the word. Think of how many things Blake was interested in! Think
                        of the avenues he can open! Art, and his pictures of Chaucer and Spenser.
                        Milton. Blake can lead students happily to concordances, analytical grammar,
                        scholarly opinions. If Blake were nothing more than a means to an end, I
                        should owe him much. But to me Blake is more, and perhaps I am <hi rend="i">particeps criminis.</hi>

                    <p>W. J. T. Mitchell of the University of Chicago will be discussion leader for
                        the 1979 Special Session on Blake at the MLA Annual Meeting. The topic will
                        be "Blake on Language and Writing." Those interested in
                        being on a panel should send Mitchell a paper of not more than fifteen pages
                        by 30 March 1979 at the latest, sooner if possible.</p>

                    <p>The topic for the 1979 meeting of the English Romantics Group of the MLA will
                        be "Death &amp; Dying in the Romantics." Papers
                        should have a reading time of 20 minutes, and they should be submitted
                        before 15 April to David V. Erdman, Crane Neck Point, Setauket, New York
                        11733.</p>
                    <p>At the next meeting of the Modern Language association of America (San
                        Francisco, 27-30 December 1979), the Division of Literature and the Other
                        Arts will sponsor a meeting on the subject of literary illustration. If you
                        or any of your colleagues would like to submit a paper to be considered for
                        inclusion on the program for this meeting, I would be very grateful for your
                        interest and participation.</p>
                    <p>By literary illustration, the Executive Committee means visual art designed
                        to be viewed and interpreted in conjunction with literary texts. The texts
                        may be written in any of the languages normally represented at the MLA, and
                        may date from any period. Medieval manuscript illuminations are no less
                        eligible than, say, the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery or the works of Phiz.
                        The Executive Committee does <hi rend="i">not</hi> encourage the submission
                        of papers on pictorialist texts which are not actually illustrated.</p>
                    <p>Three or four papers will be selected for oral presentation by the authors in
                        San Francisco. Papers should be 15-20 minutes in length, and should be
                        submitted in full rather than in abstract. If slides are included in the
                        presentation, please send them with the manuscript or describe them on an
                        accompanying list. (Projection facilities will be provided at the meeting.)
                        Papers should be sent to me at the Department of English, University of New
                        Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131, by April 20 (March 20 for non-members
                        of the MLA which has some travel funds for distinguished speakers in fields
                        other than those directly represented by the MLA (such as art history), and
                        for speakers who reside outside the United States and Canada. The Division
                        must request such funds no later than April 15, and is not certain to
                        receive them). Results will be announced by May 20. HUGH WITEMEYER,

                    <p>Each year the MLA awards the William Riley Parker prize to the author of an
                        outstanding article published in <hi rend="i">PMLA</hi> during the year.
                        This year the Prize went to Morris Eaves, University of New Mexico, for
                        "Blake &amp; the Artistic Machine: An Essay in Decorum
                        &amp; Technology," which appeared in the October 1977 issue.
                        At the general meeting Eaves accepted the cash prize of $500 and a citation
                        which reads as follows: "This essay not only illuminates William
                        Blake’s esthetic and his stance as an artist and a critic of
                        society but also casts new light on the relationship between art and
                        technology. Morris E. Eaves sets his lucid exposition of Blake’s
                        attitudes toward technological change within the broad contexts of
                        conceptual analysis, cultural history from the Renaissance to the present,
                        and the influence of the machine on the human condition."</p>
                    <p>At the Special Session on "Editing the Romantics"
                        (discussion leader E. B. Murray, University of Missouri, St. Louis), G. E.
                        Bentley, Jr., presented an illustrated lecture on the special editorial
                        problems faced by an editor of Blake.</p>
                    <p>An overflow audience of more than 100 attended the 1978 MLA Special Session
                        on Blake’s Concept of Self. Since abstracts of the first three
                        papers read by John H. Sutherland, Christine Gallant, and Robert N. Essick
                        appeared in the fall 1978 issue of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, I shall
                        summarize them only briefly here. The discussion focused primarily upon
                        points raised in the last paper on Blake’s Spectre by Morton
                        Paley, which I shall therefore report in more detail.</p>
                    <p>In "Some Blake Self-Images in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>: The Blake-Los Relationship," John
                        Sutherland traced Blake’s move from self-division to
                        self-integration (defined as a union with Los) in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>
                        10 and <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> 47. In <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Los and
                        Blake seem "close to full identification" with each other:
                        both are engaged in the same "great task" and both are
                        visually fused in the frontispiece. In <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 6,
                        Los/Blake has gained control over his Spectre, his own self-defeating
                        "pride and self-righteousness" which had appeared as
                        separate entities in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> 10. And on <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 100, Los/Blake compels his Spectre (his rational powers)
                        and his Emanation (his now acknowledged "unconsious realms of
                        imagination") to work "harmoniously for the integrated
                        individual" and at the same time to create the world of space and
                        time in which that individual can exist. Here, Sutherland concluded, Los
                        "represents Blake’s integrated self" and this
                        plate therefore is "Blake’s most convincing
                        demonstration of his own hard-won inner harmony."</p>
                    <p>Christine Gallant then argued, in "Blake’s Presence as
                        First-Person Voice in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>," that the
                        first-person voice operates much as does the authoritative dream-voice that
                        Jung said emerged from the center of the total personality or what he called
                        "the supraordinate Self." The message of this dream-voice
                        "is a final summing-up of a long process of unconscious
                        deliberation and weighing of arguments." In <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Blake acts "as spokesman <pb id="p12-219" n="219"/> for the unconscious as he encouragingly speaks to the reader
                        who has not yet dared to descend into it." Blake also claims to
                        speak the "Testimony of Jesus" and
                        "God’s words," thus utilizing the archetypes of
                        Christ and God to preserve his conscious ego in the face of an overwhelming
                        unconsciousness. Blake thereby identifies his first-person voice with that
                        Self that includes both the conscious and the unconscious. Gallant then
                        discussed the nine first-person passages in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> The
                        first six (1:1-5, 5:16-26, 15:4-35, 36:58-9, 34:27-48, 74:14-75:27) tell of
                        Blake’s life in an Ulro that grows closer and closer and in which
                        he is increasingly separated from Jesus; the last three (97:5, 98:40-41,
                        99:5) define Blake’s hardwon conviction that he has guided us
                        through Ulro to the divine vision. By using the first-person voice in the
                        last line of the poem, Gallant concluded, Blake emphasizes that this is a
                        journey that we must <hi rend="i">each</hi> undergo, again and again.</p>
                    <p>Robert N. Essick’s "William Blake: The Printmaker as
                        Poet" traced Blake’s use of imagery drawn from his
                        etching and engraving techniques. The minute particulars of his discussion
                        are too rich to be crudely summarized; readers should go to his forthcoming
                        book on Blake as a printmaker (Princeton University Press, 1979) for a full
                        exposition of this imagery. But his concluding argument can be described.
                        Blake had a love-hate relationship with his commercial profession. He
                        deliberately identified many of his printmaking activities with Urizen, thus
                        suggesting that "commercial copy engraving could become a trap, a
                        degradation of the artist’s vision, and an aesthetic-economic
                        system antithetical to Blake’s highest aspirations." On
                        the other hand, print-making can be "a medium for the expression of
                        imagination and the transcendence of this world"; hence Blake <hi rend="i">reverses</hi> Urizen’s unintelligible forms in the
                        process of printing. As Essick emphasizes, "Urizen does not print
                        his books. The <hi rend="i">reversal</hi> inherent in the printing process
                        makes all the difference, just as it does in various
                        forms—turning around, converting a state into its contrary,
                        transforming finite into infinite—at key points in the journey
                        towards apocalypse in Blake’s poetry." Through <hi rend="i">Milton, The Four Zoas</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>,
                        Blake struggled to define the proper relationship of craft to art, of his
                        potentially destructive Spectre to the imagination of Los. As Essick
                        concluded, "the drama of Los and his Spectre in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> is in part a mythic portrayal of the subordination of
                        copy work to original composition presented in the <hi rend="i">Public
                            Address</hi> and a vast metaphor for the redemption of traditional
                        techniques underlying the maturation of Blake’s graphic style
                        from 1804 to the end of his life." Finally, Essick suggested that
                        the physical labor and disciplined energy required of the engraver acted as
                        a necessary counter-balance to Blake’s "speculative and
                        digressive mind," enabling him to combine in his best poems
                        "his mental adventures and his keen sense of physical
                        reality."</p>
                    <p>Morton Paley’s essay on "Blake’s
                        Spectre" emphasized the <hi rend="i">personal</hi> aspect of the
                        Spectre, i.e., Blake’s Spectre as the embodiment of what Blake
                        didn’t like about <hi rend="i">himself</hi>, namely his fearful
                        anxiety, his hostility (both passive and active), his envy, pride, and black
                        melancholy, and his extreme sexual jealousy. Paley stressed
                        Blake’s use of the Spectre to reveal his "deep
                        ambivalence about sexual feeling" in "My Spectre around
                        me"; Blake characteristically separated sexual desire (which he
                        associated with the Spectre) from a healthy love, and thus, Paley concluded,
                        Blake is far from being "the exemplum of sexual harmony that some
                        readers may wish to make him."</p>
                    <p>Paley then analyzed the strategies that Blake used to dominate and control
                        his own evil "spectrous" feelings. He first had to
                        recognize them, as Los does when he divides the Spectre from his Emanation
                            (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 86:54); he then attempted to dominate and control
                        them. But rather than merely casting them out, which Blake knew well could
                        not be easily or permanently done, Blake offered an alternative solution. In
                        Night VIIa of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> and on plate 100 of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Blake envisioned a triumphant resolution in
                        which his healthy imagination embraced the Spectre, acknowledging that the
                        Spectre too has his place in the story. Only by coming to terms with his own
                        jealousies, pride and vindictiveness could Blake attain his ultimate vision
                        of imaginative unity: "Therefore the Sons of Eden praise Urthonas
                        Spectre in songs / Because he kept the Divine Vision in time of
                        trouble."</p>
                    <p>The questioning centered on the degree of success Blake achieved in his
                        acceptance of and control over his Spectre, and especially on whether he
                        liberated himself from a possessive, sexist attitude toward women (let me
                        say, parenthetically, that I happen to think he did not). Even if
                        Blake’s self is imaged in his poetry as finally integrated, does
                        that integration lead to productive relationships with other people, and
                        especially with women? It was suggested that these questions could be
                        fruitfully explored in another MLA Special Session on Blake and sexuality.

                    <p>Dear Editors:</p>
                    <p>Without wishing to seem ungracious to Mr. Andrew Wilton for his generous
                        review of my <hi rend="i">Samuel Palmer a Biography</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Letters of Samuel Palmer</hi>, may I make one observation?</p>
                    <p>In the latter Mr. Wilton takes me to task for my transcription of a phrase
                        from a letter of 1839, viz., "inveighed Hannah into the
                        conspiracy," and he says the word "must be
                        ‘inveigled’." Has Mr. Wilton examined the
                        MSS? If not, I can assure him that "inveighed" is what is
                        written in the originals. If Mr. Wilton consults <hi rend="i">The Shorter
                            Oxford English Dictionary</hi> he will see that one meaning of inveigh
                        is "to entice, inveigle."</p>
