          </head>
          <byline>By <docAuthor>Andrew M. <name>Stauffer</name></docAuthor></byline>
          <p>At least since Geoffrey Grigson in 1947, scholars have found that the various threatening arborescent growths in Blake’s work recall the legendary poisonous Upas tree of Java (<hi rend="i">antiaris toxicaria</hi>), popularized in England in the 1780s.<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> Grigson sees allusions to the Upas in <hi rend="i">America</hi>, “A Poison Tree,” <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania, The Four Zoas</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, as the source of the recurring “Tree of Mystery” (59-60). Furthermore, Erdman shows Blake referring to the tree explicitly in a canceled line of “Fayette.”<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> More recently, Desmond King-Hele has followed Grigson in viewing it as the source of the “horrid plant” in <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi>, as well as of the murderous growth in “A Poison Tree.”<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> Clearly the Upas was known by Blake, particularly through Erasmus Darwin, and stands behind some of his arboreal imagery. However, in the case of “A Poison Tree,” another, more appropriate botanical source exists: the Manchineel tree of the tropical Americas.<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> Also well-known in late 18th-century England, the Manchineel offers closer parallels to Blake’s poem of hypocrisy and wrath. It seems, therefore, that Blake’s imagination of poisonous trees involves a conflation of several plants represented in the works of Darwin, Coleridge, and Stedman. <note id="n1"><hi rend="s">1</hi> “The Upas Tree,” <hi rend="i">The Harp of Aeolus, and other Essays on Art, Literature &amp; Nature</hi> (Routledge, 1947) 56-65.

E.M. Beekman (U of Massachusetts P, 1981) 49-50. Beekman discusses the Upas also, on 135-39.</note></p>
          <p>To be sure, the Upas did enjoy a vogue in English literary circles following the publication of a sensationalized, romantic account of it in the <hi rend="i">London Magazine</hi> in 1783.<ref target="n5" type="note">5</ref> Allegedly written by a Dutch surgeon named Foersch as an eye-witness report, this essay presents an immense, spreading tree so poisonous that nothing can live within miles of it:
<q>
The <hi rend="i">Bohon-Upas</hi> is situated in the island of <hi rend="i">Java.</hi> . . . It is surrounded on all sides by a circle of high mountains, and the country round it, to the distance of ten or twelve miles from the tree, is intirely barren. Not a tree, not a shrub, not even the least plant or grass is to be seen. (513)
</q>
Erasmus Darwin versified this description in <hi rend="i">The Loves of the Plants</hi> (1789; republished as Part II of <hi rend="i">The Botanic Garden</hi>, 1791), summarized it in his notes, and reprinted the entire Foersch article as an appendix to the poem. Through Darwin then, the Upas legend gained a wide currency in the Romantic era, alluded to by Blake, Coleridge, Southey, and Byron, and dramatized in plays by George Colman the Younger and Stephen Reynolds Clarke.<ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref> Illustration 1 shows a slightly later image of the Upas tree, from Blume’s <hi rend="i">Rumphia</hi> (1836), presenting a more naturalistic version of the <hi rend="i">antiaris toxicaria</hi>, as a corrective reaction to the feverish mythologizing of the earlier decades. It was this Romantic-period publicity that allowed the Upas to enter the English language as a metaphor used, as Henry Yule puts it, “to indicate some institution that the speaker wishes to condemn in a compendious manner.”<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> Blake knew Darwin’s work well, even contributing an engraving to <hi rend="i">The Botanic Garden</hi> in 1791, and would have had the Upas tree at least vaguely in mind as he composed “A Poison Tree” within the next year or so.<ref target="n8" type="note">8</ref><note id="n5"><hi rend="s">5</hi> N.P.

Grigson says that the article was a hoax perpetrated by George Steevens (56ff.)</note><note id="n6"><hi rend="s">6</hi> For a survey of Romantic-period usage, see Grigson 59-64. The theatrical renditions of the legend are <hi rend="i">Dramatic Romances, Containing “The Poison Tree” and “The Torrid Zones,”</hi> attr.

          <p>However, the Upas is not the only poisonous tree mentioned in Darwin’s <hi rend="i">Loves of the Plants.</hi> Earlier in Canto III, he writes,
<q>
If rests the traveller his weary head,<lb/>
Grim MANCINELLA haunts the mossy bed,<lb/>
Brews her black hebenon, and, stealing near,<lb/>
Pours the curst venom in his tortured ear.—<ref target="n9" type="note">9</ref><note id="n9"><hi rend="s">9</hi><hi rend="i">The Botanic Garden, Part II: The Loves of the Plants. A Poem, with Philosophical Notes.</hi> 4th ed. (London, 1794) lines 187-90.</note></q>
As a note to this passage, Darwin inserts the following:
<q>
With the milky juice of this tree the Indians poison their arrows; the dew-drops which fall from it are so caustic as to blister the skin, and produce dangerous
<pb id="p35-37" n="37"/><figure n="Blume.Upas.35.2.bqscan" rend="file"><head>1.

ulcers; whence many have found their death by sleeping in its shade. (107)
</q>
The tree described here is more often called the Manchineel in English. Unlike the Upas, which blights all living things near it, looming “Fierce in dread silence on the blasted heath” (line 237), the Manchineel appears comfortably shady, safe, and inviting to the traveller, who is killed in his sleep by its secret poison.</p>
          <p>The Manchineel also seems to have been quite popular as a metaphor during this period—too popular, according to Coleridge, who was nevertheless particularly attached to it. While the Upas was just emerging as part of the language in the 1780s, the Manchineel was already common stock. Recalling his schooldays at Christ’s Hospital, Coleridge remarks, “Nay, certain introductions, similes, and examples, were placed by name on a list of interdiction. Among the similes, there was, I remember, that of the Manchineel fruit, as suiting equally well with too many subjects.”<ref target="n10" type="note">10</ref> Yet Thomas DeQuincey remembered that the young Coleridge tended to honor this list of interdictions in the breach:
<q>
    Coleridge, in his early days, used the image of a man’s “sleeping under a manchineel tree” as [a resource] for illustration which Providence had bountifully made inexhaustible in [its] applications. . . . So long as the manchineel continued to blister with poisonous dews those who confided in its shelter . . . so long was Samuel Taylor Coleridge fixed and obdurate in his determination that [this image] should come upon duty whenever, as a youthful rhetorician, he found himself on the brink of insolvency.<ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref><note id="n10"><hi rend="s">10</hi><hi rend="i">Biographia Literaria</hi>, ed. James Engell and W. Jackson Bate, 2 vols. (Princeton UP, 1969) 1:10.</note><note id="n11"><hi rend="s">11</hi> “John Keats,” <hi rend="i">Collected Writings of Thomas DeQuincey</hi>, ed. David Masson, 14 vols. (Edinburgh, 1889-90) 11:378.</note></q>
In fact, Coleridge did use the Manchineel simile at least twice in his published work in the 1790s, once to characterize one of the infamous “Two Bills” of 1795, and once to describe false friends in the dedication to his <hi rend="i">Poems</hi> (1797).<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> In that dedicatory poem, writing of “chance-started friendships,” Coleridge declares, 
<q>
. . . and some most false,<lb/>
False and fair-foliaged as the Manchineel,<lb/>
Have tempted me to slumber in their shade<lb/>
E’en mid the storm; then breathing subtlest damps,<lb/>
Mix’d their own venom with the rain from Heaven,<lb/>
That I awoke poison’d!<lb/>
(lines 25-30)
</q><note id="n12"><hi rend="s">12</hi> “The Plot Discovered,” <hi rend="i">Lectures 1795 on Politics and Religion</hi>, ed. Lewis Patton and Peter Mann (Princeton UP, 1969) 296; and “To the Reverend George Coleridge,” <hi rend="i">Complete Poetical Works</hi>, ed. E.H. Coleridge, 2 vols. (Clarendon, 1912) 1:174. Later, in 1815, Coleridge refers to the Manchineel obliquely in <hi rend="i">Biographia Literaria</hi>; of political and religious fanaticism, he writes, “The poison tree is not dead, though the sap for a season may have subsided to its roots. At least let us not be lulled into such a notion of our security” (1:197).</note></p>
          <p>Thus within the same few years, both Coleridge and Blake used the image of a poison tree to represent false friendship. As Coleridge makes plain, the Manchineel is the more appropriate source, since it presents a fair and tempting exterior which prompts one to drop defenses; the Upas, on the other hand, is literally unapproachable. Blake’s “Poison Tree” grows with “smiles” and “soft deceitful wiles” until it produces that attractive “apple bright” that betrays the speaker’s “foe” to destruction.<ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref> This tree grows in a “garden” (line
<pb id="p35-38" n="38"/>
13) rather than on a “blasted heath” like the Upas, and it operates by stealth and betrayal, like the Manchineel which positively welcomes passers-by to rest in its shade. “In the morning,” Blake’s speaker finds his foe “outstretchd beneath the tree” (lines 15-16), and lowering branches hang over the victim in the illustration, again evoking the Manchineel (illus. 2). No longer requiring its dissimulating exterior, the conquering tree is revealed by Blake’s drawing as an ugly predator. <note id="n13"><hi rend="s">13</hi> “A Poison Tree,” <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, ed.

          <p>Another set of analogues that recall the Manchineel exists for Blake’s poison tree. Blake certainly knew John Stedman’s <hi rend="i">Narrative of a Five-Years Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</hi> (London, 1796), for which he supplied a number of engravings, executed between 1791 and 1794.<ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref> Richard and Sally Price state that “Stedman’s manuscript and drawings, as well as his various meetings with Blake, seem to have exerted a significant influence on Blake’s own thought.”<ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref> Stedman spends a good deal of time describing the “quadrupedes, birds, fishes, reptiles, trees, shrubs, fruits &amp; roots” of South America, as his extended title promises, and Blake himself engraved pictures of “The Mecoo &amp; Kishee Kishee Monkeys” and “Limes, Capsicums, Mammy Apple &amp;c.” (<hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 623). While the Manchineel is not mentioned, Stedman does refer frequently to the Manicole, “of the Palm tree Species” (191). The Manicole is not poisonous—in fact, it bears “a delicious kind of white food” and its fronds are used frequently by the natives in constructing their huts (191ff.). However, Stedman tells of a night when he slept on a bed of Manicole greens, using terms that recall the legend of the Manchineel:
<q>
I lay quietly down . . . on my green Matras, where in a clear Moonshine night, And no rain, I fell a sleep as sound as a rock. But about two hours before Day break I awaked when the Moon was down, the fire was out and I almost dead by the Cold dew, and the dampness that exaled from the Earth, being so Stiff and So benumb’d that I had scarsely strength to crawl on hands and feet. . . . the Pain augmenting I soon was prevented from Breathing, without the greatest Difficulty and at last fell down behind the trunk of an old Cabbage-tree. (202)
</q>
Stedman recovered from the paralyzing dews, but Blake may have associated these two exotic trees in his mind. Finally, the <hi rend="i">Narrative</hi> does mention a number of poisonous plants,
                        <figure n="songsie.n.p6-49" rend="db" id="songsie.n.illbk.06"><head>2. “A Poison Tree,” by William Blake, from <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, Copy N, plate 35.</head><figDesc>Reproduced by permission of the Huntington Library, San Marino, California.</figDesc></figure>
most notably the unidentified “Markoory,” which seems like the mythic Upas in Stedman’s description:
<q>
The Other Tree call’d the Markoory is as Equally Dreadful for its Poisones Qualities Which are of Such a Subtle Nature, that the Verry Smoak of this Wood When set on fire is Fatal to those Animals Who Receive it in their Lungs, And it is Always on that account seen to Grow by itself, Killing everything Around it, Nay even the Slaves Refuse to Cut it Down on the Plantations so much Afraid are they of Touching it With any Tools. (459-60)
</q>
This tree, which Stedman calls “Low and Ugly, being Uneven With a verry few Branches” (460), also recalls the image engraved by Blake for “A Poison Tree.” It seems, therefore, that Stedman’s Markoory and Manicole bear some relation to Blake’s imagination of dangerous trees, and probably would have recalled the Manchineel and the Upas to his mind. <note id="n14"><hi rend="s">14</hi> See G.E.

          <p>What of the apple in Blake’s poem? After all, the Manchineel reputedly kills by means of dew-fall. However, we should recall the poem’s original title—“Christian Forbearance”—which gives no indication that the foe is laid low by poisonous fruit. Furthermore, in neither version are we actually told that the foe eats the apple; the exact means of his destruction are in any event obscure. All we know for certain is that he is tempted by the tree’s exterior appearance (particularly its bright fruit) and winds up “outstretchd beneath the tree” as a result of approaching it. On the other hand, the apple does seem central to the mechanics of the poem, albeit absent from Blake’s illustrations of the tree.<ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref> Coleridge does mention the “Manchineel fruit” in the passage quoted above, so perhaps there existed variations on the metaphor. In addition, we have the name of the tree itself. According to the <hi rend="i">Oxford English Dictionary</hi>, the term comes from the Spanish <hi rend="i">manzanilla</hi> (and French <hi rend="i">mancenille</hi>), a diminutive of apple; and the tree bears an “acrid fruit somewhat resembling an apple.”<ref target="n17" type="note">17</ref> Blake scholars have been quick to identify the “apple bright” of “A Poison Tree” as an analogue of the forbidden fruit of Genesis and <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>,<ref target="n18" type="note">18</ref> but it seems also to owe something to the poisonous apple of the seductive Manchineel. <note id="n16"><hi rend="s">16</hi> Actually, in copy E of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, held by the Huntington Library, a small, dark-reddish circle in the lower left corner of the “Poison Tree” plate may be a sole exception.

          <p>One might note, in closing, that distinctions between the Upas and the Manchineel tended to become blurred over time so that, by the Victorian era, the Upas seems to have all but swallowed its poisonous rival as a metaphor. For example, in <hi rend="i">The Blessings of Temperance</hi> (1840), illustrated by George Cruikshank, author John O’Neill presents the “dread Upas of destruction” as a symbol for alcoholic indulgence.<ref target="n19" type="note">19</ref> Yet as both poem and image make clear, this tree bears the attributes of the Manchineel: its venom comes as liquid dropped from its branches on the unsuspecting, who are attracted, not repelled, by the tree (illus. 3). O’Neill writes,
<q>
The fellest tree that ever yet took root,<lb/>
Threw up its barrelled trunk, and from each shoot<lb/>
Streamed down its poison, while the victims run,<lb/>
In crazy haste—to taste and be undone!<lb/>
Though want and crime and pestilence abound,<lb/>
And death and destruction spread around,<lb/>
And every evil passion is set loose,<lb/>
They madly rush to catch the envenomed juice;<lb/>
While, one by one, without the least control,<lb/>
Subdued, falls every virtue of the soul.<lb/>
Oh, shun this danger~ fly this fair decoy,<lb/>
Where ruin tempts you in the guise of joy—<lb/>
(49-50)<lb/></q>
This tree, a “fair decoy / Where ruin tempts you in the guise of joy,” recalls the “apple bright” and the <hi rend="i">modus operandi</hi> of the Manchineel, but “Upas” seems to have become the all-purpose name for illustrative poison trees by this point.<ref target="n20" type="note">20</ref> Such blurring of detail has perhaps led us to overlook the Manchineel as one particular forebear of Blake’s “A Poison Tree.” <note id="n19"><hi rend="s">19</hi><hi rend="i">The Blessings of Temperance, Illustrated in the Life and Reformation of the Drunkard</hi>, 1840, 4th edition (London, 1851) 49.</note><note id="n20"><hi rend="s">20</hi> Like Coleridge and the Manchineel, Grigson remembers the Upas being used as an example of “<hi rend="i">terminological inexactitude</hi>” when he was in school (56), revealing how it had taken the Manchineel’s rhetorical place by the end of the nineteenth century; see also 64-65.</note></p>

            <title><hi rend="i">Blake Set to Music</hi>: Supplement 2001</title>
          </head>
          <byline>By <docAuthor>Donald <name>Fitch</name></docAuthor></byline>
          <p>This supplement—to my <hi rend="i">Blake Set to Music: A Bibliography of Musical Settings of the Poems and Prose of William Blake</hi> (Berkeley: U of California P, 1990)—is an attempt to locate and describe the Blake-inspired music that has come to light in the past ten years. The proliferation of online catalogs in the music information centers of many countries has encouraged composers to publicize their work by contributing information about it. For this reason we have citations for many earlier works, sometimes dating back several decades, as well as for works created within the last ten years since <hi rend="i">Blake Set to Music</hi> was published. Not everything is covered in this way; as one of the directors commented, “we are dependent upon what the composers submit to us,” but the search for new material has been very rewarding. Blake continues to inspire composers. More than 300 entries make up this report, ranging from the mammoth creations of Julia Usher and Kristian Hornsleth to the individual settings of any number of others. In this past decade earlier manuscript editions have been printed, or works like Morfydd Owen’s centenary editions have been reissued, and these have been duly noted. All the familiar Blake texts still attract; <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> was notably popular with at least seven composers in this last decade.</p>
          <p>I am grateful for the opportunity to call attention to a number of Blake settings overlooked by my book but included in Gooch and Thatcher’s <hi rend="i">Musical Settings of British Romantic Literature.</hi> For most of these I have been able to provide additional details, both descriptive and biographical, and, in consulting with the composers and their publishers, have turned up further Blake settings. There remain a very few composers from this source, marked with an asterisk, that I have not been able to verify in any way.</p>
          <p>I want to acknowledge here the friendliness and repeated help of staff in the national music information centers, especially Anthea Parker (Australia), Jonathan Grimes (Canada), Marianne Horn (Denmark), Anni Heino (Finland), Els van Swol (Netherlands), Scilla Askew and Philip Collins (NZ), Alasdair Pettinger (Scotland), Peter Bitterli (Switzerland), Imogen Mitchell (UK), and Lyn Liston (AMC:USA). Publishers’ representatives like David Wordsworth (Schott Music), Hannah Clark (Boosey &amp; Hawkes), David McCleery (Chester Music), and Julian Knight (Oxford) were always helpful, and certainly many composers willingly responded to my importuning letters with encouragement and information. To all these I am most grateful. Finally, Eunice Schroeder, music librarian at UC Santa Barbara, was particularly helpful with the albums of several rock artists whose music has taken Blake interpretation off in new directions.</p>
          <p>The last item in each entry is the initial source (S: —) of information; in most cases other details have been added from other and unnamed sources. As much as possible I have attempted to give enough information to make the list useful to both musicians and Blake scholars.</p>

          <p>This extensive exhibition in the British Museum added an important dimension to the consideration of apocalypse and millennium at the end of the twentieth century, and brought a badly needed sense of a thousand years of historical difference in celebrating the new era. With a couple of hundred separate items ranging as far back as the Anglo-Saxon Tiberius Psalter from Winchester Cathedral right up to modern films such as Ingmar Bergman’s <hi rend="i">The Seventh Seal</hi> (1957) and Derek Jarman’s <hi rend="i">The Last of England</hi> (1987), “The Apocalypse and the Shape of Things to Come” portrayed the full range of millenarian responses. These include not only the woodcuts of Albrecht Dürer, but also extensive examples of the sixteenth-century artists Hans Burgkmair and Georg Lemberger, both of whom worked in the visual tradition of Dürer. Of particular interest is the series of engravings by the French goldsmith and tapestry designer Jean Duvet (c. 1485-1561), whose works are intensively crowded with objects and figures.</p>
          <p>The richly researched catalogue includes significant contributions by scholars such as Frank Kermode and Norman Cohn, but it is David Bindman’s chapter “The English Apocalypse,” annotating the large area of exhibition space given over to one of the most distinctive of the European representations of religious endgame, which will be of most immediate interest to students of Blake. English interpretations of apocalypse were heavily politicized in the aftermath of the Reformation and the English Civil War. No doubt the French Revolution has also been seen as the imminent apocalypse of the whole history and cast its enormous influence on Britain through the eighteenth century to the nineteenth century.</p>
          <p>The watercolor of <hi rend="i">The Last Judgment</hi> from Petworth House formed a key component of the Blakes in the exhibition, but other works brought together for comparison included <hi rend="i">The Angel of Revelation</hi> (New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art), <hi rend="i">The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun</hi> (New York, Brooklyn Museum of Art; Washington DC, National Gallery of Art) and <hi rend="i">The Number of the Beast Is 666</hi> (Philadelphia, Rosenbach Museum and Library), as well as paintings and drawings from Tate Britain, the Fitzwilliam Museum, and the British Museum’s own collection, including seven plates from its copy of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> plus an eighth, plate 51, from the Fitzwilliam. The wide historical reach of the exhibition meant that there was also opportunity to compare these works with reproductive engravings derived from Michelangelo’s fresco of the <hi rend="i">Last Judgment</hi> by Bonasone, Rota, and Wierix. However, Blake’s own versions and interpretations of the apocalyptic theme would have taken elements from his contemporaries. In this respect, the exhibition proved the enduring influence of John Hamilton Mortimer’s <hi rend="i">Death on a Pale Horse</hi> (1775) and Benjamin West’s painting of the same subject (Royal Academy of Arts). Bindman’s essay in the catalogue brings out rather well the political controversy which surrounded the royal commission of West’s painting. Blake’s Bible illustrations (c. 1799-1810) for Thomas Butts must have been influenced by West’s five paintings of Revelation subjects exhibited at the Royal Academy in the years 1796 to 1798. Although West, as president of the Academy, always claimed his loyalty to King George III, the king appeared hostile to him and claimed in 1794 that the Academy was “under the Stigma of having many Democrats in it.”<ref target="n21" type="note">1</ref> This element of political controversy surrounding depictions of apocalyptic subjects reached back many years. <note id="n21">1. Kenneth Garlick and Angus Macintyre, eds., <hi rend="i">The Diary of Joseph Farington</hi>, 16 vols. and index (New Haven and London, 1978-96) Vol. IV p. 1334 (28 Dec. 1799).</note></p>
          <p>Following sixteenth-century religious polemics, the seventeenth-century imagery converted the dialectic contrast of good versus evil between Catholics and Lutherans to political polemics and offensive propaganda. The antithesis of salvation and damnation, of Christ and Antichrist, is associated not only with the religious last judgment but also with political trials in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The origins of these controversies in English political culture
<pb id="p35-62" n="62"/>
are shown in an engraved diagram by Joseph Mede, a seventeenth-century Anglican and royalist, whose <hi rend="i">The Key of Revelation</hi> (1650) viewed the apocalyptic end of history as being when “the Kingdoms of the World are become our Lordes and His Christes,” that is, the redemption of mankind. Showing how intricate this iconology could be, on the other hand, an anti-Catholic satire published by William Peake in 1643 could have been interpreted at the time as an attack on the Anglican Church and court, where the Roman Pope is represented as the Whore of Babylon seated on the seven-headed Beast. In this way, the fusion of religious and political meanings could have completely opposite interpretations. In much the same way, both the opposing pro- and anti-Cromwell parties at the end of the Civil War took the apocalyptic view by representing Cromwell as the Antichrist devil in the woodcut <hi rend="i">The True Emblem of Antichrist</hi> and as Christ the savior in the engraving <hi rend="i">The Embleme of Englands Distractions.</hi></p>
          <p>The exhibition also showed three exceedingly rare rough relief woodcut prints of “Poor Adam” never published before. The prints were made by the York-based prophet Adam Toppin, who was active in the 1760s. These works are known only from two collections, in the Huntington Library, San Marino, California, and the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven. The prints combine images and texts, which are either cut on one woodblock or put together with letterpress. Toppin’s work derived its apocalyptic imagery from a work by George Tillinghast, a Fifth Monarchy man who at first welcomed Cromwell as a prophet but later viewed him as Antichrist. Such prints, combining image and text, provide an important context for understanding Blake’s illuminated books in both their technique and content. Their rarity perhaps indicates the possibility of a wider circulation among less educated people. Blake might not have seen Poor Adam’s works, but this does not eliminate the possibility that similar prints were around in his lifetime.</p>
          <p>Popular print culture is equally important in Blake’s time. For example, Thomas Rowlandson’s satires use apocalyptic imagery to support the Whig party in an etching showing Charles James Fox as St. George fighting against the Dragon of Revelation in <hi rend="i">The Champion of the People</hi> (1784), while in the <hi rend="i">Downfal[l] of Monopoly in 1800</hi> (14 August 1800), Rowlandson refers to West’s <hi rend="i">Death on a Pale Horse.</hi> The most popular religious image from the end of the eighteenth century through the nineteenth, however, is that of the Tree of Life derived from the Book of Revelation. The exhibition shows several of these motifs in hieroglyphic form in which the viewer is required to decipher the meanings of quite elaborate combinations of text and image. For example, the anonymous prints published by the printsellers Bowles and Carver in the 1780s, and J. Catnach in 1830s, remained very similar in many respects in both their composition and detail, depicting a large Tree of Life—bearing “twelve manner of fruits” described in Revelation 22:2—upon which Jesus is crucified. In the foreground, separated with a barrier from the redeemed Jerusalem, is this present Evil World with the gate of hell at the right. The two preachers in the print are identified as the most famous Methodists, Wesley and Whitefield. This was in keeping with the association between Methodism and millenarianism occasionally made at the time. Nevertheless, the Tree of Life (also from Genesis, where it is contrasted with the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil) shown with the crucified Jesus is not mentioned in the Book of Revelation but was obviously well known to contemporary viewers. Facing such imagery, students of Blake will easily recall the full-page illustration of Albion worshipping the crucified Jesus on an oak tree in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 76, which is also shown in the exhibition. Showing how complex this imagery could become, J. Bakewell’s hand-colored engraving <hi rend="i">Hieroglyphics of the Natural Man</hi> (1780s) depicts a barren tree with the fruits of Deism, Anger, Envy, etc., intertwined by a serpent and watered by Death and Devil. Its companion, <hi rend="i">Hieroglyphics of a Christian</hi>, by contrast shows a leafy tree bearing the fruits of Joy, Truth, and Peace, guarded by angels. These simple contrasts of good and evil could have inspired Blake’s thoughts leading to the more intricate philosophy of right, wrong, and paradox in <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.</hi> Indeed, the basic elements of composition from the Tree of Life visual tradition continued well into the nineteenth century, as shown in the colored lithograph <hi rend="i">The Broad and Narrow Way</hi> (1883).</p>
          <p>The exhibition also highlighted the engravings of Garnet Terry, which have been the subject of an article, “Is There an Antinomian in the House? William Blake and the After-Life of a Heresy” by Jon Mee (<hi rend="i">Historicizing Blake</hi>, ed. S. Clark and D. Worrall, Macmillan, 1994). In Mee’s opinion, Terry shares many similarities with Blake both as radical engraver and antinomian Christian in representing millenarian ideas. The exhibition showed one of the most important of Terry’s prints, <hi rend="i">An Hieroglyphical Print of Daniel’s Great Image, or Mystical Man</hi> (1793). It illustrates the Old Testament prophet Daniel’s vision of the figure in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream with a head of gold and feet of iron and clay, standing for Babylon and the kingdom of the world, which in the prophecy will be smashed and replaced by the eternal kingdom. The description accompanying the image reads “Daniel’s Great Image of the Mystical Body of Babylon shewing the approaching Destruction of Antichrist, the Beast, the Whore, and the False Prophecies of Daniel, and confirmed by the Signs of Times.” In his tract, Terry states that the great image of Babylon was the antetype of London in the 1790s and that its destruction prophesied the downfall of its rulers. This notion is also shared by the radical antinomian preacher William Huntington, who had Terry as his bookseller in the 1780s. The other print, <hi rend="i">An Hieroglyphical Print of the Church of God in Her Five-Fold State</hi> (1791), engraved by Terry after a design by William Huntington and a painting by E.F. Burney, was perhaps an aid to Huntington’s preaching. The
<pb id="p35-63" n="63"/>
square-shaped Holy Jerusalem floating above the clouds in the print reminds us of the four-dimensional city of Golgonooza, Los’s city of “Art and Manufacture” (E 120) in Blake’s <hi rend="i">Milton, a Poem</hi> (1804). The captions below Terry’s print actually refer to a similar idea; scenes around the Holy City show “Artists, Mechanicks, and Manufacturers, Engaged in their Respective Pursuits for promoting the various Branches of Natural Religion.” The spiritual ideals of millenarianism and the rejection of the materialism of Natural Religion are clearly common to Huntington, Terry, and Blake.</p>
          <p>Garnet Terry is also a useful point of comparison with James Gillray (1756-1815), who is more widely known to present day audiences, Garnet being involved more with radical religious and social ideas, while Gillray’s caricatures pick up on this wider awareness of millenarianism which formed the object of his political satires. In his hand-colored etching <hi rend="i">The Prophet of the Hebrews,—The Prince of Peace Conducting the Jews to the Promised Land</hi>, 5 March 1795, Gillray depicts the millenarian prophet Richard Brothers (1757-1824), the self-proclaimed Prince of the Hebrews and Nephew of the Almighty, as a revolutionary trampling on the Beast of Revelation with king’s and bishop’s heads. Brothers carries a bundle on his back containing the Elect recognized as the Whig opponent Charles James Fox and his colleagues, and approaches the Gate of Jerusalem, which is a gibbet. The satire on both Brothers and Fox is for their support of a peace treaty with the French Directory, which was opposed by Edmund Burke. In another colored print, <hi rend="i">Presages of the Millenium</hi> [sic];—<hi rend="i">with The Destruction of the Faithful, as Revealed to R: Brothers the Prophet, &amp; attested by M.B. Hallhead Esq.</hi>, 4 June 1795, Gillary uses Brother’s prophecy to satirize both opposing political parties at the time. The Prime Minister, William Pitt, is depicted as Death on a pale horse, taking the image from West’s well-known painting, his bottom kissed by a small figure of the Prince of Wales, and his horse kicking the opposing party led by Charles James Fox.</p>
          <p>The anticipation of millennial apocalypse in Blake’s time was a result of the revolutionary atmosphere, where political anxieties were involved with religious enthusiasm. However, Blake seemed more inclined to represent religious ideas than contemporary political surroundings. Although many of the prophets or prophetesses, such as Richard Brothers and Joanna Southcott, were satirized in the contemporary prints shown in the exhibition, Blake took a more moderate view of millenarianism and regarded himself as a prophet in the role of an artist—as he says, “Every honest man is a Prophet” (E 617). The exhibition gave Blake a major part in the section on English Apocalypse, where 21 out of the 53 images on display were his works. In addition to the ten watercolors directly depicting the scenes from the Book of Revelation, the exhibition also brought together scenes from Blake’s illustrations of <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts, Jerusalem</hi>, and Dante’s <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy</hi> with apocalyptic implications. Of course, the rationale for Blake’s inclusion in the exhibition is that the idea of apocalypse underlies almost all of his major works throughout his life, and led to his myths of the spiritual history of mankind from creation to the fall and redemption. However, the exhibition also successfully revealed the print tradition of apocalypse, which would have been familiar to Blake. In the context of the exhibition as a whole, Blake’s view of the apocalypse stood out as a revolutionary contribution to the tradition. His many images of Death and the Beast contrast radically with all the others, especially those of his contemporary, the Royal Academician Benjamin West.</p>
          <p>For modern artists, the meaning of apocalypse seems more an expression of desperation than of hope for redemption. War, death, illness, madness, and chaos dominate the entire scene after the section on the eighteenth century. For the coming of an atheistic age, biblical apocalypse turns into something beyond Blake’s world. It seems Blake is one of the last artists who had hope in the apocalyptic end of time.</p>
