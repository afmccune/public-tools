        <p>Robert N. Essick’s first sales review was for 1971; that year, he detailed
                    the sale of “Tiriel Supporting Myratana” and “Tiriel
                    Leaving Har and Heva” for $15,420 and $9766 respectively. This year, he
                    records the auction of another <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> drawing for
                    £170,400 (including fees).</p>
        <p>J. B. Mertz (jeffrey_mertz@hotmail.com) is writing what he hopes will be the last
                    chapter of his doctoral thesis on William Blake and the circle of Joseph
                    Johnson. He has published articles on Blake in this journal as well as in <hi rend="i">Notes and Queries</hi> and <hi rend="i">Modern Philology.</hi></p>

          </head>
          <byline>By <docAuthor>Robert N. <name>Essick</name></docAuthor></byline>
          <p>The 2006 Blake market began auspiciously with the January auction of a
                        watercolor drawing, <hi rend="i">Oberon and Titania on a Lily</hi> (illus.
                        9). Sotheby’s New York placed a brave estimate of $400,000 to
                        $600,000 on this small work, for many years in the collection of the great
                        book and print collector Philip Hofer (1898-1984) and, since his death,
                        apparently in the possession of one or more of his descendants. Not for the
                        first time, my suspicion that a work by Blake was overestimated proved
                        unfounded. Bidding began at $200,000, rose rapidly to $400,000, paused for
                        about seven seconds at that level, and then jumped two more steps of $25,000
                        each to reach a successful bid of $450,000 ($520,000 inclusive of the
                        buyer’s premium). The winner was John Windle, the San Francisco book
                        dealer who specializes in Blake, acting on behalf of the artist and writer
                        Maurice Sendak. The whole process took about ninety seconds. Given his
                        earlier acquisitions, including copies of <hi rend="i">Songs of
                            Innocence</hi> and <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi>, Sendak must be
                        considered one of the major Blake collectors of our time.</p>
          <p>Loyal readers of this journal will have learned of the dispersal of
                        Blake’s nineteen watercolors illustrating Robert Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> from E. B. Bentley’s lively and
                        insightful essay in the fall 2006 issue.<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref>
                        This report will necessarily repeat information provided by Bentley, but
                        will add a few new facts and speculations. Sotheby’s New York offered
                        the drawings at a special auction, devoted exclusively to the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> illustrations and with each design in its own lot, on 2 May
                        2006 (illus. 2-5, 8). This was the most spectacular Blake sale since the
                        legendary auction of W. Graham Robertson’s collection at
                        Christie’s London in 1949. The supposed sale of the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> designs in 2005 to a firm in Switzerland was simply a way
                        for the London dealer Libby Howie and her financial backers to get the
                        designs out of Britain. If sold individually in a London auction, each would
                        require an export license, and this might have had a chilling effect on any
                        non-British bidders. That concern, combined with the fact that most
                        important Blake collectors reside in North America, prompted the New York
                        venue. <note id="n1">1. Bentley, “<hi rend="i">Grave</hi>

          <p>The pending auction attracted a good deal of attention in the press. The
                        first news story, by Carol Vogel, appeared in the 16 February issue of the
                            <hi rend="i">New York Times</hi>, complete with four illustrations, two
                        in color. The title of the story, “Art Experts Protest Sale of Rare
                        Set of Blakes,” indicates its general thrust. Vogel’s
                        well-researched essay was followed by an unsigned editorial in the 20
                        February <hi rend="i">Times</hi> claiming that “to sell the
                        watercolors one by one is, at the very least, to misconstrue Blake’s
                        art.” The contentious relationship between art and commerce, so much
                        a part of Blake’s life and writings, continues into our own time.
                        John Windle also believed that the impending auction would mean the tragic
                        dispersal of an integrated series of designs. Accordingly, in March he wrote
                        to a number of Blake collectors, asking them to form a consortium to make a
                        presale offer for all nineteen designs (or, failing that, bid on each at
                        auction) and donate the series to an institution, such as the Tate
                        Collection or the Huntington Library, which already had a significant Blake
                        collection. This worthy effort came to naught.</p>
          <p>Sotheby’s went all out to promote the auction. Selling nineteen highly
                        valued Blakes at one time could easily overwhelm the niche market for such
                        material. Thus, it was incumbent upon Sotheby’s to attract bidders
                        from the much larger pool of collectors of British and Old Master drawings,
                        most of whom had demonstrated no prior interest in Blake. In mid-March,
                        potential bidders were sent a handsome brochure with color reproductions of
                        five designs and of the red morocco case in which the entire group had been
                        housed, possibly for over 180 years. The watercolors were displayed at
                        Sotheby’s facilities in London (9-15 March), Paris (20-24 March),
                        Chicago (27-28 March), New York (31 March-5 April), and Los Angeles (11-12
                        April). The catalogue for the sale, sure to become a collector’s item
                        in its own right, was published as a hardbound book with all nineteen
                        watercolors reproduced in color, supplementary illustrations of related
                        designs, and a scholarly text by Nancy Bialler, Sotheby’s senior vice
                        president for Old Master prints, drawings, and paintings.</p>
          <p>On 1 May, a number of Blake collectors, dealers, and scholars assembled in
                        New York to view the designs and witness the events of the next day. The
                        group included Elizabeth B. Bentley, G. E. Bentley, Jr., David Bindman,
                        Georgia and Morris Eaves, Alexander Gourlay, John and Mary Lynn Grant, Sarah
                        Jones, Roger Lipman, Karen Mulhallen, Alan Parker, Joseph Viscomi and Maria
                        Fernandez, Chris and John Windle, and your intrepid reporter. The auction
                        opened precisely at <pb id="p40-117" n="117"/> 10:15 a.m. on 2 May. The sale
                        began triumphantly—from the vendor’s perspective—with
                        the title page (illus. 2) fetching a hammer price $390,000 above the high
                            estimate.<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> The estimate range of
                        $180,000 to $260,000 for this lot seemed low to many interested parties.
                        When I inquired about it, Sotheby’s told me that the presence of
                        writing on the watercolor would depress its marketability to drawings
                        collectors. A very odd reason, it seemed to me—and apparently to the
                        several bidders who drove the work to $650,000 plus fees. <note id="n2">2.
                            The “hammer price” is the bid at which the auctioneer
                            sells a lot, exclusive of the buyer’s premium or any other fees.
                            In this discussion I am referring to these hammer prices at which a lot
                            is “knocked down” by the auctioneer; the net prices,
                            including buyers’ premiums, are given in the sales listings
                            below.</note></p>
          <p>Healthy bidding continued for the second lot, <hi rend="i">The Meeting of a
                            Family in Heaven</hi>, which fetched $140,000 over high estimate. The
                        next lot, <hi rend="i">Death of the Strong Wicked Man</hi>, sold within the
                        estimate range, but matters began to slip with the fourth lot, <hi rend="i">The Grave Personified</hi>, selling at a hammer price $200,000 below
                        low estimate. The purchaser was probably simply bidding against the
                        unannounced reserve price.<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> The suspicion
                        that lot 5, <hi rend="i">Whilst Surfeited upon Thy Damask Cheek</hi> (illus.
                        3), was overestimated at $700,000 to $1 million proved prescient when the
                        work failed to sell. <hi rend="i">The Reunion of the Soul and the Body</hi>,
                        lot 6, was knocked down to a bidder on the telephone at the low estimate of
                        $900,000. At this point, the auction went decidedly sour—again, from
                        the point of view of the vendor and the auction house. No bidders stepped
                        forward to meet the reserves on the next four lots, a group that included
                        two of the most highly estimated works, <hi rend="i">The Day of
                            Judgment</hi> at $1.5 to $2 million, and <hi rend="i">Death’s
                            Door</hi> (illus. 5) at $1 to $1.5 million. Lot 11, <hi rend="i">The
                            Soul Exploring the Recesses of the Grave</hi>, found a new owner, but at
                        a price well below the estimate range. The next three lots failed to sell,
                        but the final five watercolors all found purchasers. Of these, all but one
                        failed to achieve the low estimate. The exception was the final drawing, <hi rend="i">Friendship</hi>, which exceeded the same low estimate range
                        granted the first lot. The now-empty portfolio in which the designs were
                        housed for many decades also went well beyond its high estimate to reach
                        $4200, sold to Windle for stock. <note id="n3">3. The
                            “reserve” is the price below which the vendor and the
                            auction house have agreed not to sell a lot. Given the below-estimate
                            yet successful bids on several lots, it seems as though the reserves
                            were roughly twenty percent below the low estimates.</note></p>
          <p>Eight of the nineteen drawings were bought in; another six sold for less than
                        low estimate. Thus, fourteen of the twenty lots (counting the portfolio)
                        were very probably considered to be disappointments by the seller. The total
                        hammer price for the sold lots was $6,184,200—considerably less than
                        the roughly $8.6 million Howie is reported to have paid for the whole group.
                        Of course she still had eight drawings to sell. By the end of June,
                        Sotheby’s had arranged sales to anonymous private collectors for
                        three of the works unsold at auction: <hi rend="i">The Soul Hovering over
                            the Body Reluctantly Parting with Life, The Day of Judgment</hi>, and
                            <hi rend="i">Death’s Door</hi> (lots 7, 9, 10). If I am right in
                        estimating that the reserves were twenty percent below low estimate, and
                        assuming that these three drawings were sold in the neighborhood of these
                        reserve prices, then Howie gained roughly $2.5 million through after-auction
                        sales (less Sotheby’s fees of about 20%). She was still short of
                        recovering her initial costs by about $415,000. The remaining five unsold
                        lots (5, 8, 12-14) were returned to Howie by early July 2006. Any profits
                        would have to come from their future sale.</p>
          <p>Lacking serious offers for the unsold drawings, Howie and her backers may
                        decide to retain them for the immediate future. The rule of thumb is to wait
                        at least five years before attempting another auction, although this is
                        often honored in the breach in today’s hot art markets. If
                        Sotheby’s retained for itself the $918,440 in buyers’
                        premiums, plus fees for arranging the three after-auction sales, that was
                        probably sufficient to cover costs plus a little profit. The auction house
                        may have also received a vendor’s premium from Howie, although some
                        sales contracts waive that customary provision.</p>
          <p>Did potential bidders demur because of the controversy surrounding the
                        dispersal of the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> watercolors? I doubt that this was
                        a significant factor, at least for private collectors. Three of the five
                        major Blake collectors active today participated in the auction; each took
                        home at least one design. The absentees were Leon Black and Maurice Sendak:
                        the former may have been one of the anonymous purchasers, while the latter
                        was a bit out of pocket due to his purchase of <hi rend="i">Oberon and
                            Titania on a Lily</hi> in January. Two drawings were acquired by
                        Continental collections, thereby indicating Blake’s growing
                        reputation as an artist beyond the Anglo-American community.
                        Sotheby’s and its vendor simply overestimated the value of too many
                        lots. The market could not absorb nineteen expensive Blake drawings at a
                        single auction, even with the widening of the circle of Blake collectors
                        through the addition of a few new participants. Perhaps the lesson to be
                        learned from the proceedings is the old adage that investing in art for
                        short-term profit is a risky business, even for professionals like Libby
                        Howie.</p>
          <p>The dispersal of the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> watercolors, some into anonymous
                        private collections, will make studying all the originals arduous, even
                        impossible. Fortunately, the William Blake Archive, available online at
                        &lt;http://www.blakearchive.org&gt;, has recently published all
                        nineteen watercolors, plus one removed from the original group of twenty at
                        an unknown time but now in the Yale Center for British Art. The 300 dpi
                        enlargements in the Archive will make close study of details possible. The
                        Archive also includes Schiavonetti’s engravings, published in R. H.
                        Cromek’s 1808 edition of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, and
                        Blake’s white-line etching of “Deaths Door” (illus.
                        6).</p>
          <p>The lively 2006 Blake market continued into the fall auction and catalogue
                        season. On 23 November, Sotheby’s London offered one of
                        Blake’s <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> illustrations, <hi rend="i">Tiriel
                            Led by Hela</hi> (illus. 10). This was the first <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> wash drawing to come to market since two were sold at a
                        Christie’s auction in 1971. The widely held opinion in the trade that
                        the work was overestimated at £150,000 to £200,000 proved wrong,
                        for the drawing fetched <pb id="p40-118" n="118"/> a hammer price of
                        £145,000, just below the low estimate, but £170,400 when the
                        auction-house fees are included. A few hours after the auction, I was
                        informed by Emmeline Hallmark of Sotheby’s that “there is some
                        confusion surrounding the sale of the Blake.” I was not able to
                        unravel this mysterious “confusion” by January 2007, but will
                        report any further information in my 2007 sales review.</p>
          <p>At the end of November, Windle issued another in his series of impressive
                        catalogues of Blake and Blake’s circle. Catalogue 42 is devoted
                        exclusively to engravings and etchings by Blake, including some great
                        rarities. Each of the ninety-three items is accompanied by at least one
                        thumbnail illustration; every item is included in the listings below.</p>
          <p>Readers of the 2005 sales review may have noticed that works by Thomas
                        Stothard, and particularly his book illustrations, were beginning to consume
                        more space than Blake’s. To avoid having to change my title to
                        “Stothard in the Marketplace,” I have instituted a new policy
                        for that prolific artist. Beginning with this review, I continue to list
                        sales of all drawings, separate prints, and prepublication proofs of book
                        illustrations by Stothard that have come to my attention, but I include only
                        those editions of books illustrated by Stothard that are not mentioned in
                        the standard reference works: A. C. Coxhead, <hi rend="i">Thomas Stothard,
                            R.A.</hi> (London: Bullen, 1906) and Shelley M. Bennett, <hi rend="i">Thomas Stothard: The Mechanisms of Art Patronage in England circa
                            1800</hi> (Columbia: U of Missouri P, 1988). Thus, newly discovered book
                        illustrations will still be recorded.</p>
          <p>The year of all sales and catalogues in the following lists is 2006 unless
                        indicated otherwise. Works offered online and previously listed in either of
                        the last two sales reviews are not repeated here. In my 2005 review, I
                        failed to include several works by Blake’s circle and followers
                        offered in John Windle’s catalogue 40 of November 2005. These
                        materials are listed below. The auction houses add their purchaser’s
                        surcharge to the hammer price in their price lists. These net amounts are
                        given here, following the official price lists. The value-added tax levied
                        against the buyer’s surcharge in Britain is not included. Late 2006
                        sales will be covered in the 2007 review. I am grateful for help in
                        compiling this review to Martin Bailey, Emma Baudey, Nancy Bialler, Martin
                        Butlin, Alex Chappell, John E. Grant, Mary Lynn Grant, Emmeline Hallmark,

                        Windle. My special thanks go to Alexander Gourlay for his generosity in
                        keeping me abreast of internet auctions. Once again, Sarah Jones’
                        editorial expertise and John Sullivan’s electronic imaging have been

                                Art. This is the only Blake etching known to me which has been cut
                                along a design element—in this case, a vine—to create
                                a decorative frame. Blake may have printed the designs only, and
                                masked the texts, of these 3 pls. as part of, or as an experiment
                                leading up to, his <hi rend="i">Small Book of Designs</hi> of 1796.
                                I suspect, however, that someone else trimmed the pl. reproduced
                                here to its present configuration, one which also eliminated the
                                vine at the bottom of the pl. Provenance: sold “The Property

                                from the same “Property” in the same auction, #209-10.
                                The previous 3 lots, all Blake materials, were sold “The

              <figDesc>Pen and gray and black inks and watercolor over traces of
                                pencil, 33.2 × 26.6 cm. The angel of the last trump recalls
                                the skeleton to animate life. Although the design may have been
                                executed along with other illustrations to Blair’s poem in
                                the fall of 1805, Blake could not have added the text before he had
                                learned, in late Nov. or early Dec. 1805, that Schiavonetti had been
                                hired to engrave the designs. The “1806” date would in
                                that case have been anticipatory or not added until that year. It is
                                also possible that this watercolor was a later addition to the
                                group, executed in the same year as the inscribed date. There is a
                                small patch of abrasion just right of the second line (“a
                                Poem”) of the inscription, but nothing further that might
                                indicate an alteration in the wording. The leaf is larger than any
                                of the other designs in the original group of 20 and is backed with
                                stiff paper rather than mounted on a backing board with framing
                                lines. An alternative title page in the Huntington Library and Art
                                Collections (Butlin #616) is also dated “1806.” That
                                work is inscribed “A Series of Designs . . . Invented &amp;
                                Drawn by William Blake” and may have been intended as a title

                                (Yale Center for British Art, Butlin #633), once part of the series
                                of mounted <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> watercolors, this is a
                                contemporary scene, although the costuming of the man follows
                                Blake’s predilection for tight-fitting (and partly
                                see-through) jumpsuits. The subject of the design is indicated by
                                the small, spiraling worm just above the man’s extended left
                                foot. The woman gestures to her “damask cheek” with
                                her right hand and to the worm with her left; the man strides
                                towards and stares into the open grave. Perhaps the shadows
                                extending behind his feet, executed with the same black wash
                                picturing the depths of the pit before him, indicate the inevitable
                                fate even for a robust youth. His arms and hands, crossed over and
                                grasping his chest, suggest that he has just realized that binding
                                truth. The gothic church, however, offers a different portal, one
                                suggesting an alternative vision of death as a transition to
                                immortal spirit. See the similar use of gothic motifs in illus. 8.
                                Is the sun pictured just above the distant mountain setting or
                                rising? The passage illustrated does not specify the time of day.

                                × 23.5 cm., datable to the fall of 1805. The design does not
                                illustrate any specific passage in Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> but would seem to form a contrastive pair with <hi rend="i">The Widow Embracing Her Husband’s Grave</hi>
                                (Yale Center for British Art, Butlin #633). Like several of the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> illustrations, Blake has recycled a
                                composition he first executed years earlier, in this case <hi rend="i">Burial Scene</hi>, a wash drawing datable to c. 1780-85
                                (McGill University Library, Butlin #137 recto). John E. Grant and
                                Mary Lynn Grant have suggested in conversation that the adult male
                                in the design reproduced here might be a clergyman, rather than the
                                father of the title, and the youthful but mature woman the mother of
                                the boy to her right. The father would then presumably be in the
                                grave to which the clergyman gestures. When in 1794 Blake used a
                                similar composition to illustrate “The Garden of Love”
                                in <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi>, the adult male became a
                                tonsured ecclesiastic. Sotheby’s catalogue of 2 May 2006,
                                #15, comments interestingly on the style of this watercolor:
                                    “<hi rend="i">A Father and Two Children</hi> is more
                                loosely executed than any of the other watercolors offered here.
                                While the faces are worked up in some detail, the surroundings are
                                indicated by quick brush strokes, thereby leaving the trees and the
                                lantern rather two dimensional.” These features are similar
                                to those in <hi rend="i">Churchyard Spectres Frightening a
                                    Schoolboy</hi> (Essick collection, Butlin #342), a design also

                                probably the “Specimen of the Stile of Engraving”
                                which was on display at “the Proprietor’s, Mr.
                                Cromek,” according to the first prospectus of Nov. 1805 for
                                his edition of Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave.</hi> According to
                                Robert T. Stothard, Thomas Stothard’s son, Cromek found
                                Blake’s print “etched . . . so indifferently and so
                                carelessly . . . that he employed Schrovenetti [sic] to
                                engrave” the designs (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>[2] 219). In his
                                white-line etching, reversed in comparison to the watercolor (illus.
                                5), Blake has replaced the small plants behind the old man’s
                                back with a thorny branch and added some spiky leaves lower right
                                (left in the watercolor). The slight indications of vegetation above
                                the tomb have also been altered. These changes, however, are
                                inconsequential in comparison to the quantum shift in sensibility
                                and style. It is not difficult to imagine Cromek’s reaction
                                to the etching, so different in feeling and mode of expression from
                                the watercolor he probably had already approved for publication. Its
                                aesthetic is more akin to the purposeful primitivisms of early
                                modernism, such as Paul Gauguin’s and Edvard Munch’s
                                wood engravings or the work of German expressionists, than to
                                anything within the compass of early nineteenth-century tastes.
                                Blake’s print is so foreign to those tastes that no publisher
                                of the time would have included such a work in a book intended to
                                make money. As is typical of his efforts as an experimental
                                printmaker, Blake uses white-line etching as an opportunity for
                                transformation and reinvention, not simply as a means of replicating
                                an image invented and already executed in a different medium.
                                Further, Blake allows the intrinsic properties of the medium to
                                express themselves—darkness, crepuscular illumination, rugged
                                forms that signal their production through the scraping-out of
                                resist and the biting of acid. The image is caverned out of metal,
                                like the recesses of the tomb. Blake’s work forces upon our
                                apprehension its means of execution—overwhelmingly so, from
                                Cromek’s perspective.</figDesc>

                                illustration executed by Schiavonetti. Perhaps Cromek wanted to see,
                                before proceeding further with his project, the differences between
                                Blake’s and Schiavonetti’s work. In contrast to
                                Blake’s white-line etching (illus. 6), Schiavonetti’s
                                print is an accurate graphic translation of the watercolor (illus.
                                5). His work is readily apprehended, with each motif clearly
                                indicated, whereas Blake’s print disconcerts such easy
                                “reading” of the image. To this day, many people to
                                whom I have shown the two prints side by side prefer

                                The figure of the ascending Christ is very similar to <hi rend="i">The Ascension</hi> (Fitzwilliam Museum, Butlin #505), one of
                                the biblical watercolors Blake painted for Thomas Butts c. 1803-05.
                                That work includes the apostles standing below Christ, replaced in
                                the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> design by “his train” of
                                “followers,” as Blair’s text specifies. These
                                include, from left to right, the (right?) hand of a figure otherwise
                                not pictured (suggesting that the group is a small portion of a much
                                larger gathering, as with the arms and hands of the marginal angels
                                in Blake’s Job engravings, pl. numbered 14); a small female
                                (or boy with long hair), probably younger than the larger figures;
                                an embracing couple, similar to the father and mother in “The
                                Meeting of a Family in Heaven,” a published <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> illustration, but the man is bearded and would
                                appear to be older than the woman in this design; a woman with a bun
                                or coil of hair on the back of her head; probably a male with wavy
                                hair; a woman with two strands of loose hair dangling down her back;
                                another woman with slight indications of the same coiffure; a female
                                or male with long hair, symmetrically placed with the similarly
                                sized (and youthful) figure on the left; and only the legs and a bit
                                of the body and head of a figure cut off by the right margin. The
                                sense of weightlessness is common to all the figures. The gothic
                                arches above Christ, decorated with praying angels and (palm?)
                                fronds, continue the portal imagery central to the entire series of
                                illustrations. These architectural motifs hint at Blake’s
                                concept that imaginative art is one of the routes to, or even one
                                with, the spiritual world. This watercolor is free of the foxing
                                that slightly mars others in the series; its delicate colors are

                            Sold July by Windle and Maggs Bros. to a British private collector. The
                            auction cat. suggests that this may be the work sold from the Graham
                            Robertson collection, CL, 22 July 1949, with 2 other works in #58,
                            described as “a slight sketch of a head in a tall hat of the
                            Italian renaissance” (£18.18s. to Maggs). That drawing,
                            however, measured only “8 in. by 13 in.” (20.3 ×
                            33.0 cm.); note particularly that its height is less than its width
                            (just the reverse of the drawing sold SL). Previously offered

            <p>Might this head of a sullen soldier bear some relation to Blake’s
                            confrontation with John Scofield in August 1803 (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi>[2] 158-66)? Scofield was a private soldier in the 1<hi rend="s">st</hi> Regiment of Dragoons. In his letter to Thomas Butts
                            of 16 Aug. 1803, Blake states that Scofield “put himself into a
                            Posture of Defiance” (E 732) when Blake evicted him from his
                            garden. The phrase nicely fits the man’s expression in this
                            Visionary Head. The incident and subsequent trial for sedition haunted
                            Blake for decades, as indicated by the many references to those events
                            and personalities in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (1804-20). At the very
                            least, I suspect that it would be difficult for Blake to draw a
                            soldier’s head of this sort without calling to his mind some
                            recollection of Scofield. The canted cylinder forming the upper
                            structure of the man’s hat in this drawing resembles several
                            varieties of helmets worn by horse-mounted soldiers during the
                            Napoleonic era. The griffin decorating the hat recalls the eagle-headed
                            and winged men in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl. 46.</p>

              <figDesc>Watercolor, 21.1 × 16.2 cm. Butlin #245, dating the work
                                to c. 1790-93. Photo courtesy of Sotheby’s New York, where
                                the drawing was sold on 25 Jan. to Maurice Sendak. Clearly, the
                                sleeping female reclines, and the alert male sits, on two separate
                                lilies, not the single “lily” of the title first given
                                to the work by William Michael Rossetti in his catalogue of
                                Blake’s drawings and paintings in Alexander Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi> (London: Macmillan, 1863) 2:
                                237, #213. A third, unopened flower rises above the female figure.
                                Rossetti’s association of the design with
                                Shakespeare’s <hi rend="i">A Midsummer Night’s
                                    Dream</hi> seems reasonable. As Sotheby’s cataloguer
                                points out, the nearest point of textual contact is in act 2, scene
                                2, when Oberon “has just sprinkled her [Titania’s]
                                eyes with a potion that will cause her to fall in love with the
                                first living creature she sees when she awakes.” There are
                                many references to flowers, including one to “lily
                                lips,” throughout the play, but there is no indication in
                                this or any other scene that the king and queen of the fairies rest
                                on flowers. Additional evidence supporting Rossetti’s title
                                is provided by the similarity between the two figures and Oberon and
                                Titania in <hi rend="i">Oberon, Titania, and Puck with Fairies
                                    Dancing</hi> (Butlin #161, dating the work to c. 1785), a design
                                firmly connected with Shakespeare’s text. Oberon also wears a
                                crown and a cloak, the latter fastened at the shoulder with a
                                brooch, and holds a scepter in <hi rend="i">Oberon and Titania,
                                    Preceded by Puck</hi> (Butlin #246, dating the work to c.
                                1790-93). I suspect that most viewers will perceive the figures in
                                the watercolor reproduced here as diminutive fairies resting on
                                flowers of normal size, but Blake’s many transformations in
                                perspective, from the minute to the cosmic, might also warrant our
                                seeing the figures as humans in a world of gigantic plants.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Oberon and Titania on a Lily</hi> is William
                                Blake’s variation on a design first executed by his brother
                                Robert in the notebook they both used (Butlin #201.5[13]). In
                                Robert’s pen and wash drawing, a man and woman, both probably
                                crowned and neither asleep, recline on a poppy. A ring of
                                hand-holding figures, hovering beneath a partly opened flower above
                                and behind the couple, is probably a portrayal of the
                                “roundel” of Titania’s attendants at the
                                beginning of act 2, scene 2 of <hi rend="i">A Midsummer
                                    Night’s Dream.</hi> The relationship between poppies and
                                sleep, such as Titania’s in act 2, scene 2, is a
                                long-standing convention. The iconographic significance of
                                William’s shift to lilies—traditional emblems of
                                purity, the Virgin Mary, and the Bourbon monarchy of
                                France—is not easily deciphered. A slightly altered version
                                of William’s watercolor, reversed, appears as a full-pl.
                                design in <hi rend="i">The Song of Los.</hi> That literary context
                                offers little assistance to the interpreter. Perhaps the closest
                                point of contact with the text of <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi>
                                is the “valleys of delight” from which “Antamon
                                call’d up Leutha” (E 67). In <hi rend="i">Europe a
                                    Prophecy</hi>, Antamon is “prince of the pearly
                                dew” and Leutha the “Soft soul of flowers” (E
                                65); the latter is also intimately associated with flowers and
                                female sexuality in <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of
                                    Albion.</hi> Whatever the composition’s symbolic import,
                                its connection with his beloved brother may have been its main
                                attraction for William.<lb/><lb/> Blake’s method of composing
                                pls. for his illuminated books did not require detailed preliminary
                                drawings. Thus, it is highly unlikely that this watercolor was
                                executed as part of the production of <hi rend="i">The Song of
                                    Los</hi>, dated 1795 on its title page. Butlin’s dating
                                of the watercolor to c. 1790-93 suggests as much, and also implies
                                that the design’s meaning in the context of the illuminated
                                book may not be relevant to the watercolor. I see nothing in the
                                style of the drawing, and in particular the rather careless handling
                                of Oberon’s face, to prohibit an even earlier date than
                                Butlin’s, closer to the execution of Robert’s version
                                or his death in 1787. The figures in <hi rend="i">Oberon and
                                    Titania, Preceded by Puck</hi> are particularly crude and thus
                                would warrant a date much earlier than Butlin’s c. 1790-93.
                                Perhaps William and Robert began to work together in the early- or
                                mid-1780s on images inspired by <hi rend="i">A Midsummer

              <figDesc>Pen and gray washes over pencil, 17.8 × 26.9 cm.,
                                datable to c. 1788. Butlin #198.10, then in the collection of Mrs.
                                Louise Y. Kain, Louisville, Kentucky. The vendor at SL on 23 Nov.,
                                listed as a “Family,” probably inherited the work from
                                Mrs. Kain. One of 12 finished illustrations to Blake’s poem
                                    <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi>, and 1 of only 3 remaining in private
                                hands (3 are untraced since 1863 when the entire group was dispersed
                                at auction). Tiriel’s daughter, Hela, leads her blind father
                                through a wooded but open landscape. Tiriel’s curse has
                                caused some of Hela’s hair to turn into snakes that spring
                                from the top of her head. Like all the finished <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> designs, this example was very probably prepared as
                                a preliminary for an intaglio etching/engraving never executed.
                                Blake may have had in mind for his illustrated poem a format similar
                                to the one he describes at the end of the <hi rend="i">Island in the
                                    Moon</hi> manuscript: “Then said he I would have all the
                                writing Engraved instead of Printed &amp; at every other leaf a
                                high finishd print . . .” (E 465). Photo courtesy of

                            cat. claims that this portrait is based on Blake’s life mask, but
                            there is only a slight similarity between the two. The cat. also quotes
                            Bacon as follows: “I do find that his [Blake’s] poetry is
                            better than his painting or drawing, which I really don’t like at
                            all. . . . I loathe his mystical side. . . . I don’t like
                            anything which comes too close to Religion.”</p>

                                1791. Lowell Libson, Sept. cat. “Of the Moment,” #50,
                                illus. color ($34,000). The design was engraved in 1791 by Anker
                                Smith and published as the frontispiece to Part 1 (“The
                                Economy of Vegetation”) of Erasmus Darwin’s <hi rend="i">The Botanic Garden.</hi> Previously offered in
                                Libson’s May 2002 cat. of “British Master
                                Drawings,” #14, illus. color ($42,000). The drawing contains
                                left-handed hatching, typical of Fuseli’s drawings, but is
                                somewhat stiff, like a copy. David Weinglass believes that the
                                drawing is probably by Fuseli, but might be by Gideon Fairman, who
                                engraved the design for the New York 1807 ed. of <hi rend="i">The

                                far from certain. The price indicates that at least 2 bidders
                                believed that this very lightly sketched outline drawing is from
                                Fuseli’s hand.</p>

                                    × 70.8 cm., signed by Palmer on a damaged label attached
                                    to the back of the original frame and inscribed “[Ri]sing
                                    Moon,” datable to c. 1857. Essick collection. Unrecorded
                                    until its offer at auction, CL, 9 June 2005, #45 (not sold;
                                    estimate £50,000-80,000). Provenance: Given by Palmer to
                                    George Richmond (according to Christie’s 2005 and 2006
                                    cats.); William Fothergill Robinson, who married
                                    Richmond’s daughter, Julia, in 1869; by descent to the
                                    vendor at CL, 5 June 2006, #57. The gilt-composition frame,
                                    damaged top left but now repaired, was probably selected by
                                    either Palmer or Richmond. Palmer referred to works of this size
                                    as his “large long” watercolors; this may be one
                                    of the earliest examples. The building on the left recalls
                                    Ightham Mote in the Shoreham Valley, while the reclining
                                    shepherd, lower right, may owe something to Colinet’s
                                    posture in Blake’s 3<hi rend="s">rd</hi> Virgil wood
                                    engraving. The rocky mountains on the left show the influence of
                                    the Devonshire tors; the highest peak, oddly tilted on its axis,
                                    may also be indebted to the outcrop supporting Tintagel Castle
                                    in Cornwall. Palmer visited Devon several times, beginning in
                                    the summer of 1834, and drew views of the Tintagel promontory in
                                    1848. Although an idealized English pastoral, the design
                                    incorporates the cypress trees Palmer encountered on his
                                    extended honeymoon trip to Italy, 1837-39.<lb/><lb/> This
                                    watercolor is similar to, and possibly the basis for,
                                    Palmer’s 1857 etching of the same title (see illus. 12).
                                    A presumably related watercolor, also titled <hi rend="i">The
                                        Rising Moon</hi> and measuring 19.7 × 42.5 cm.
                                    (Palmer’s “little long” format), has been
                                    untraced since 1928; see Raymond Lister, <hi rend="i">Catalogue
                                        Raisonné of the Works of Samuel Palmer</hi>
                                    (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1988) #552. Palmer produced several
                                    other variants on the basic composition: <hi rend="i">The
                                        Sunset</hi>, datable to 1857 (Lister #546); <hi rend="i">Sheepfold at Sunset</hi>, signed and dated 1871 (Lister
                                    #658); and a c. 1880 brown wash drawing illustrating Virgil, <hi rend="i">Eclogue II: Homeward from Labour’d
                                        Furrows</hi> (Lister #V4).<lb/><lb/> The watercolors with
                                    gum arabic and the use of body color are confined to the
                                    landscape and figures. The sky is a watercolor wash with little
                                    if any thickening agent. Palmer was evidently trying to combine
                                    the density of oils for the landscape with the translucency of
                                    watercolors for the sky. Like several other Victorian artists,
                                    Palmer has moved far from the eighteenth-century tradition of
                                    watercolor <hi rend="i">drawing</hi> to create watercolor <hi rend="i">painting</hi> with a wide variety of effects
                                    carefully deployed.<lb/><lb/> Why did the work reproduced here
                                    fail to sell, on an estimate of £50,000-80,000, in June
                                    2005 but achieve a hammer price of £80,000 a year later in
                                    the same auction rooms? One significant factor may be the Palmer
                                    exhibition at the British Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of
                                    Art, New York, 21 Oct. 2005 through 28 May 2006. After viewing
                                    the exhibit, several collectors changed their minds about the
                                    course of Palmer’s artistic career. The show demonstrated
                                    that the differences in quality between his famous
                                    “Shoreham” period work and the best of his later
                                    watercolors are not as great as previously surmised. This is a
                                    good example of how well-mounted scholarly exhibitions can
                                    influence the market.</figDesc>

            <p>Pp. 258-60, “The Ancient of Days.” The main purpose of this
                            entry in the cat. is to demonstrate that there is no copperplate of
                            “The Ancient of Days” distinct from the one Blake used to
                            print the frontispiece to <hi rend="i">Europe a Prophecy</hi>, and that
                            the two examples of the design, then in the collections of Geoffrey
                            Keynes (now Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge) and George Goyder, long
                            thought to be original impressions from the presumed second copperplate,
                            are actually facsimiles produced by William Muir c. 1885. Their coloring
                            is modeled on the frontispiece in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> copy D, since
                            1859 in the British Museum. In the cat. I further claim, or at least
                            imply, that the Keynes and Goyder works are lithographs, extensively
                            hand colored. A careful examination of another example of the Muir
                            facsimile, sold on EB in Dec. 2005 and now in my collection, prompts me
                            to revise that claim. The recently acquired Muir was executed completely
                            by hand, as a watercolor drawing, without any lithographic base. A
                            reexamination of color reproductions of the Keynes and Goyder works
                            leads me to conclude that they were also executed completely by hand by
                            Muir. These three examples vary considerably among themselves, including
                            differences in portions of the image that are printed in Blake’s
                            original impressions. In the latter, these printed passages are close to
                            identical, except for slight inking variations. Further, these three
                            Muir facsimiles vary—in their supposedly printed but actually
                            hand drawn passages—from the printed image in original
                            impressions, from the lithograph of the frontispiece Muir included in
                            his 1887 facsimile of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, and from a version of
                            Muir’s “The Ancient of Days” in my collection
                            printed in golden-yellow ink from the same lithographic matrix as
                            Muir’s <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> facsimile but colored like the
                            completely hand-drawn examples. This last print, like those in
                            Muir’s <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, includes printed framing lines
                            about 6 mm. outside the image. I suspect that all the Muir facsimiles of
                            “The Ancient of Days” with framing lines have a
                            lithographic base, while those lacking the framing lines were executed
                            completely by hand. In all completely hand-executed examples I have
                            seen, the figure’s windblown beard does not extend beyond the
                            left side of the circle surrounding him. In copies with a lithographic
                            base, the beard is much longer and extends beyond the circle, as in
                            Blake’s originals and Muir’s <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>
                            facsimile. Both the Keynes and Goyder works are of the short-beard type
                            and lack framing lines.</p>

                            (London: Bemrose &amp; Sons, 1885) 106, the author states that
                            “amongst the effects of the late Mr. Geo. Cumberland, who was an
                            intimate friend of Blake’s, was found an etching, evidently the
                            one that served Blake as his copy [in the <hi rend="i">Monthly
                                Magazine</hi>], on which is written, ‘Wright, of Derby;
                            etched by himself.’ This is the only instance known of Wright
                            having used the etching point.” This self-portrait etching,
                            rather crude in its execution, is reproduced on the same page, lacking
                            the “written” inscription but with the letterpress caption
                            “Joseph Wright. Etched by himself.” Although the
                            attribution of the etching to Wright might be questioned, it seems very
                            probable that Bemrose is right about the etching in Cumberland’s
                            possession being the basis for Blake’s etching/engraving in the

                            Cumberland’s print, or any other impression of the etched

            <title>Gilbert Dyer: An Early Blake Vendor?</title>
          </head>
          <byline>By <docAuthor>J. B. <name>Mertz</name></docAuthor></byline>
          <p>In April 1821, the antiquarian and collector Francis Douce (1757-1834)
                        acquired <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> (B), an early and
                        unique copy that includes the monochrome intaglio etching “The
                        Accusers” (B) as its frontispiece.<ref target="n4" type="note">1</ref> While it is not clear whether Douce acquired these two works
                        gathered together in the present binding, <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>
                        does not appear in Douce’s lists of books sent to be bound between
                        April 1821 and his death.<ref target="n5" type="note">2</ref> As I note in
                        “An Unrecorded Copy of Blake’s 1809 Chaucer
                        Prospectus,” Douce listed his acquisitions in a set of three
                        notebooks entitled “Collecta,” which show that he obtained
                        “Blake’s marr. of heaven &amp; hell” from
                        “Dyer” (a name that regularly appears in these notebooks).<ref target="n6" type="note">3</ref> The fact that Douce did not write the
                        full name of this source in the “Collecta” has provoked
                        speculation about his identity. In the second edition of <hi rend="i">Blake
                            Records</hi>, G. E. Bentley, Jr., suggests that the “former owner
                        was probably Lamb’s friend George Dyer.”<ref target="n7" type="note">4</ref> However, this must be an oversight because Bentley
                        notes elsewhere in <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> that Douce’s
                        friend Isaac D’Israeli (1766-1848) wrote to a “M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Dyer” requesting “as soon as possible a copy of
                        Blake’s Young” (i.e., <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>),<ref target="n8" type="note">5</ref> and suggests that “Dyer”
                        could be Gilbert Dyer, “probably the same Dyer from whom Francis
                        Douce acquired <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (B) in April 1821.”<ref target="n9" type="note">6</ref> Essick likewise suggests Gilbert Dyer as
                        a possible source of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> (B), though he considers
                        it more likely that Douce’s “Dyer” was “the
                        London printseller Charles George Dyer.”<ref target="n10" type="note">7</ref> Finally, Joan Stemmler, noting the prior comments of Bentley
                        and Essick, assumes that the identity of “Dyer” is
                        self-evident: “That by ‘Dyer’ is meant Gilbert Dyer,
                        the bookseller to Dibdin and D’Israeli, seems certain.”<ref target="n11" type="note">8</ref> While the idea that Gilbert Dyer sold
                        Douce his copy of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> has been raised by others,
                        it now stands on more solid ground than earlier commentators may have
                        realized. My review of letters and notebooks from the Douce collection, as
                        well as the fact that Douce’s bibliophile friends D’Israeli
                        and Thomas Frognall Dibdin (1776-1847) knew of Dyer or dealt with him,
                        provides further evidence supporting the conjectural identification by
                        Bentley and Essick of the bookselling business of Gilbert Dyer of Exeter as
                        the source of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> (B). <note id="n4">1. G. E.

          <p>The name “Dyer” first appears in the “Collecta”
                        for September 1808, when Douce acquired “A batch of prints of
                            Dyer.”<ref target="n12" type="note">9</ref> On at least
                        twenty-eight separate occasions between 1808 and 1825, Douce obtained
                        various items from a source always identified simply as
                        “Dyer,” the last entry appearing in November 1825 (“6
                        Caricatures Rowlandson—Dyer”).<ref target="n13" type="note">10</ref> The only years during this period in which Douce apparently
                        acquired nothing from Dyer were 1822 and 1824. Douce sometimes provides
                        details of his acquisitions from Dyer, for instance noting the receipt of
                        “Six front[ispieces] by Stodart &amp; Westall &amp;c. Orig. edit.
                        of the Tatler” in May 1812,<ref target="n14" type="note">11</ref>

          <p>The likely purveyor of the majority of these books, drawings and prints,
                        Gilbert Dyer (bap. 1743, d. 1820), worked as a schoolmaster, operated a
                        circulating library, published four books, and established a bookselling
                        business on Exeter’s High Street by 1793.<ref target="n22" type="note">19</ref> After his death, Dyer’s son, also called

                        High Street until selling the business to William Strong of Bristol around
                        the beginning of 1829.<ref target="n23" type="note">20</ref> Consequently,
                        Douce dealt with both father and son, but the bulk of his acquisitions falls
                        before the death of the elder Dyer in October 1820 and <hi rend="i">The

                        this work. In a letter to Douce dated 15 December 1805, Dyer wrote,
                        “For Expressing your Opinion of the Principles of my Book I feel
                        myself particularly obliged—For your Acco<hi rend="s">t</hi> of M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Ritson’s Enquiries into this Subject I am also

                        letter, Dyer delivered several items to Douce, indicating that payment could

          <p>Douce’s longtime friend and correspondent, the novelist and man of
                        letters Isaac D’Israeli, was a Blake collector<ref target="n26" type="note">23</ref> and apparently dealt with the elder Dyer. As noted
                        above, D’Israeli wrote to “M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Dyer”
                        on 3 January 1819 requesting “as soon as possible a copy of
                        Blake’s Young.”<ref target="n27" type="note">24</ref>
                        D’Israeli may also have visited Dyer’s bookshop during a
                        period of convalescence in Exeter from 1794 to 1796.<ref target="n28" type="note">25</ref> In his correspondence to Douce from Exeter,
                        D’Israeli mentions Dyer’s catalogues three times. The first

          <p>A second longstanding friend of Douce (and of D’Israeli), the
                        bibliographer Dibdin, was also a Blake collector<ref target="n32" type="note">29</ref> and refers to Dyer in <hi rend="i">Bibliomania</hi>
                        (1811). One of Dibdin’s characters, Philemon, says he has been
                        informed of “very choice and copious collections of books about to be
                        sold” and notes that another character, Lorenzo, “is about to
                        visit the booktreasures of Mr. Dyer of Exeter.”<ref target="n33" type="note">30</ref> With his characteristic inattention to detail,
                        Dibdin writes in a footnote: <q> Mr. George Dyer of Exeter is a
                            distinguished <hi rend="i">veteran</hi> in the book-trade: his catalogue
                            of 1810, in two parts, containing 19945 articles, has, I think, never
                            been equalled by that of any provincial bookseller, for the value and
                            singularity of the greater number of the volumes described in it.<ref target="n34" type="note">31</ref></q> Regrettably, Dibdin’s correspondence to Douce preserved in the
                        Bodleian contains no references to Blake or Gilbert Dyer.<ref target="n35" type="note">32</ref> Also, despite the apparent contemporary popularity
                        of Dyer’s catalogues, few copies seem to be extant (or, at least,
                        indexed) in modern libraries; I am aware of only one, his 1811
                            catalogue.<ref target="n36" type="note">33</ref> However, the
                        familiarity of both D’Israeli and Dibdin with Gilbert Dyer the elder,
                        their shared enthusiasm for books and prints, and their mutual friendship
                        with Douce together support Bentley and Essick’s identification of
                        the Dyer bookshop as the source of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> (B). The
                        stature and reach of Dyer’s business, its many years as a visible
                        presence in the trade, and the fact that Douce’s dealings with
                        “Dyer” extend across a period of more than seventeen years
                        likewise speak in favor of the Exeter bookseller as Douce’s source.

          <p>Douce’s acquisition of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> from Gilbert
                        Dyer raises several questions. First, how did an early copy of
                        Blake’s illuminated book reach Devon? As provincial booksellers, the
                        Dyers certainly would have dealt with agents in London, such as Thomas
                        Ostell of Ave Maria Lane (noted above), who co-published <pb id="p40-149" n="149"/> Dyer’s <hi rend="i">Restoration of the Ancient Modes of
                            Bestowing Names</hi> and received payment in his behalf from Douce in
                        1805. Conceivably, Dyer continued the relationship with the successors to
                        Ostell, C. Cradock and W. Joy (though I have not been able to confirm
                            this).<ref target="n37" type="note">34</ref> If Dyer acquired <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> (B) directly from a local or regional owner
                        rather than through a London agent, could Blake’s Cornish friend and
                        patron, the antiquarian John Sidney Hawkins (bap. 1758, d. 1842) have had a
                        hand in its appearance in Exeter? In 1783, John Flaxman obtained a
                        commission for Blake to produce “a capital drawing” for
                        Hawkins, who apparently ordered more drawings and planned to raise a
                        subscription to send Blake “to finish [his] studies in
                            Rome.”<ref target="n38" type="note">35</ref> In September 1800,
                        Blake informed George Cumberland that “I have shewn your Bonasoni to
                            M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Hawkins my friend,”<ref target="n39" type="note">36</ref> and in October 1804 he also mentioned to William
                        Hayley “[o]ur good and kind friend Hawkins” and “his
                        former kindness to me” (E 756). Although none of Blake’s
                        drawings for Hawkins has been identified or traced,<ref target="n40" type="note">37</ref> it appears that Blake’s friendly
                        relationship with his patron continued from 1783 through at least 1804.
                        Since nothing is known of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> (B) between the
                        time of its production and April 1821, perhaps Hawkins can provide the
                        missing link. <note id="n37">34. Ostell may have died around 1808, as
                            suggested by the publishers’ imprint in the third edition of

                            William Hazlitt’s edition of <hi rend="i">The Eloquence of the

          <p>Second, does the acquisition of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> from a dealer
                        who with few exceptions sold Douce drawings and prints suggest that Douce
                        was interested in the graphic rather than the literary component of
                        Blake’s works? Bearing in mind that Douce’s Blake collection
                        consisted of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> (I), <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> (B),
                        the first ballad from <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads</hi>

                        argue that Douce’s choices reflect an interest in Blake as artist,
                        arthistorical commentator and theorist (with respect to <hi rend="i">A
                            Descriptive Catalogue</hi> as well as the Chaucer Prospectus) and

          <p>Finally, should we consider Douce’s acquisition of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> in terms of his extensive
                        interest in illuminated texts, many of them medieval (his collection
                        included numerous fine specimens of books of hours, illustrated manuscripts,
                        prayer books and psalters)?<ref target="n45" type="note">42</ref> Given the
                        rich coloring of D’Israeli’s copies of Blake’s
                        illuminated books and their impressive dimensions (“they are all
                        large folio copies printed on one side of the leaf”), Joseph Viscomi
                        has speculated that “D’Israeli’s interest in the
                        illuminated books appears to have been primarily pictorial rather than

                        have influenced Douce’s interest in Blake. Similarly, Dibdin’s

                        focuses on “the bizarre but original and impressive ornaments by

          <p>In the absence of a Dyer catalogue, c. 1821, offering Blake’s book and
                        “The Accusers” for sale, materials in the Douce collection as
                        well as his connections with D’Israeli and Dibdin seem to confirm the
                        idea raised by Bentley and Essick that Douce acquired this unique and early
                        copy of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>, possibly in its present binding,
                        from the Dyer bookshop. Although Dibdin’s works are marred by
                        inaccuracies and infelicities, my investigation suggests that we can safely
                        agree with his claim in <hi rend="i">Bibliomania</hi> concerning the
                        “value and singularity” of many volumes offered for sale by
                        Dyer, especially as <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> (B) has a place among the

          <p>Marsha Keith Schuchard’s <hi rend="i">Why Mrs Blake Cried: William
                            Blake and the Sexual Basis of Spiritual Vision</hi> is a book which will
                        be eagerly read and widely cited. It has many features which will attract a
                        popular readership—sex, drugs, magic, secret societies, conspiracy,
                        and sensational discoveries. It had instant éclat from before the day
                        of publication. While it was still in page proof, the editors of Michael
                        Bedard’s biography of Blake, then also in page proof, telephoned him
                        in agitation because his book did not record the “sexual
                        shenanigans” (53) detailed in <hi rend="i">Why Mrs Blake Cried.</hi>
                        It is therefore important to evaluate it carefully.</p>
          <p>This is a genuinely learned book, with quotations from works in English,
                        Danish, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Latin, and Swedish. Research for it
                        has been remarkably diligent, with genuine discoveries in far-flung and
                        unfamiliar collections, such as manuscripts in the Academy of the New Church
                        (Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania), Alnwick Castle, Grand [Masonic] Lodge Library
                        (London), Riksarkiv (Stockholm), Stiftsbibliothek (Linköping), and
                        Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine (London). Schuchard has
                        enviable gifts, flair, and energy.</p>
          <p>It is impressively wide-ranging, letting Observation with extensive View
                        Survey Phalli from China to Peru, or at least from London to Paris, Rome,
                        Lithuania, Saxony, West Africa, India, and Tartary. It is lavishly endnoted
                        (345-406), though often the relationship of note to text is obscure, indeed
                        invisible to me.</p>
          <p>It is extraordinarily eclectic, with much from animal magnetism, the Electric
                        Celestial Bed, Kabbala, Masons, Moravians, “Perpetual Virile
                        Potency” (chapter 18), Tantra, the Temple of Hymen, Yoga, and Yogic
                        Yonis (chapter 22).</p>
          <p>Because the subject matter is unfamiliar, a good deal of background is
                        presented. There are long desert wastes of text where Blake is not even
                        mentioned (in my reading and according to the index), except for casual
                        references like “as we will see”; for instance, chapters 5-9
                        (59-121), on “Swedenborg and Kabbalistic Science,”
                        “Erotic Dreams and Ecstatic Visions,” “Sacramental
                        Sexuality,” “Judaised Yoga,” and “Phallic Feet
                        and Tantric Toes,” are almost entirely Blake-free. This seems odd in
                        a book ostensibly about Blake.</p>
          <p>The principal thesis is that when Blake proposed to introduce a concubine
                        into his household, with exotic and sensational sexual rituals, “Mrs
                        Blake Cried.” Schuchard even proposes a candidate as concubine:
                        “Was Elizabeth Butts [the wife of his patron] the proposed second
                        wife who sent Catherine Blake into floods of tears?” (261). These
                        floods of tears created marital disharmony, episodes of which are narrated
                        with surprising precision, supported chiefly by reading Blake’s poems
                        as if they were autobiographical. “Catherine Blake often seemed
                        baffled and frightened by her husband’s sexual demands . . .”
                        (257).</p>
          <p>The primary problem of the book is that the biographical evidence for
                        Catherine Blake’s tears is extraordinarily slight. In <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> (2nd ed.), the only reference to Catherine in tears
                        is in the account of Blake’s deathbed given by Cunningham (1830)
                        §48. There are no “floods of tears” at all, and she
                        neither “weeps” nor “wept.” The first reference
                        to a concubine in the Blake household appeared more than forty years after
                        Blake’s death when Swinburne, who was not born until ten years after
                        Blake died, wrote (1868) that Blake “propose[d] to add a second
                        wife,” which elicited “tears” from Catherine, and Ellis
                        and Yeats (1893) took this up: “Blake wished to add a concubine to
                        his establishment . . . but gave up the project when it made Mrs Blake
                        cry” (Schuchard 3). This is a remarkably frail foundation on which to
                        erect such a mighty superstructure.</p>
          <p>There are a number of real discoveries here. Schuchard establishes an
                        important alchemical connection with the discovery of the “collection
                        of alchemical books” of Blake’s friend John Augustus Tulk in
                        Linköping, Sweden (401n5) which make it plain that Tulk “was a
                        practising alchemist. . . . John and Nancy Flaxman collaborated with him.
                        When Nancy Flaxman gave a talk, ‘On the Summary of Alchemy’,
                        to their Attic Chest Club, she was not just theorising” (316).
                        Schuchard quotes (328) a Moravian hymn by Count Zinzendorf called “Te
                        Matrem” printed in 1754: <q> Thou didst inspire the Martyrs
                            tongues,<lb/> In the last gasp to raise their songs.<lb/> Thou dost
                            impel the four Zoa,<lb/> Who singing rest not night nor day. </q></p>
          <p>But many of her claims are unproved or implausible. She cites the practices
                        of the Hasidim of Vilna (Lithuania) as if relevant to the Fetter Lane
                        Moravians and Blake (49). She thinks that Blake’s fellow-apprentice
                        and partner “James Parker . . . may have come from a Moravian family,
                        for several Parkers are listed as members of the Congregation from 1745 to
                        1752” (161), though Parker is probably an even more common name than
                        Blake. She speaks of Blake’s “experiments in Animal
                        Magnetism” which “were probably connected” with his
                        “recurrent bouts of mania, depression and paranoia” (261).
                        “Blake . . . read Edward Moor’s <hi rend="i">The Hindu
                            Pantheon</hi> (1810)” (305), and a copy of <hi rend="i">A
                            Collection of Hymns: Consisting</hi><pb id="p40-151" n="151"/><hi rend="i">Chiefly of Translations from the German Hymnbook of the
                            Moravian Brethren</hi> (London: James Hutton, Bookseller in Fetter Lane,
                        1749) was “apparently owned by Catherine Armitage” (351n18),
                        merely because she quotes the hymn. The evidence for all this is very
                        slight.</p>
          <p>There is proliferating “evidence” in <hi rend="i">Why Mrs Blake
                            Cried</hi> of influence by association—Blake’s friend
                        Richard Cosway was a sexual free-thinker, John Augustus Tulk was an
                        alchemist, George Cumberland met Cagliostro.</p>
          <p>Among the welter of scholarship in <hi rend="i">Why Mrs Blake Cried</hi>,
                        learned footnotes, and references to arcane archives, there are just two
                        previously unrecorded pieces of evidence related to William Blake and his
                        family. All the rest is context—very frequently a context in which
                        Blake’s role is invisible or incredible.</p>
          <p>The two new pieces of evidence, complete with scholarly apparatus, are (1)
                        Blake’s mother was still active in the Moravian congregation in 1753,
                        when the Moravian Brother West “was instructed to speak to
                        ‘Sis. Arm.’ about some financial matter” (126) and (2)
                        Blake was shown the priapic sculptures in Charles Townley’s
                        collection.</p>
          <p>The Moravian reference is surprising for several reasons. First, it occurs
                        two years after the death of Thomas Armitage in 1751, when, according to the
                        Moravian records, Catherine Armitage “Became a Widow &amp; left the
                            Congregation.”<ref target="n48" type="note">1</ref> Second, it
                        refers to her as “Sis. Arm.”, though no previous known record
                        of her in the Moravian archives abbreviates her name thus. Third, it refers
                        to her by the name of her first husband, though she had married James Blake
                        in 1752. <note id="n48">1. Moravian Church Archives: Church Catalogue
                            C/36/51/1, 36.</note></p>
          <p>In fact, the Moravian reference is not to Blake’s mother at all. What
                        it says is: “Bro. West will care that Sis. Orm is spoken to to know
                        her Resolution abt. Lending Bro. Rob the money he wants.”<ref target="n49" type="note">2</ref> Sister Orm was a member of the Fetter
                        Lane Moravian Church at the time; Sister Blake (formerly Armitage) probably
                        was not. <note id="n49">2. Moravian Archives: Helpers Conference Minutes
                            (C/36/11/6) for 20 May 1753, generously transcribed for me by the
                            Moravian archivist Lorraine Parsons. She tells me that Keri Davies
                            agrees with her that the name is “Orm”, not
                            “Arm.”</note></p>
          <p>The other new biographical fact about William Blake is that “the
                        Priapic collectors [Sir William] Hamilton, [Charles] Townley and [Richard
                        Payne] Knight discreetly displayed their Indian [priapic] <hi rend="i">objets d’art</hi> to friends—including Blake, Cumberland,
                        Flaxman, Hayley and [General Charles] Rainsford” (295). The evidence
                        given for this statement is “British Museum, Townley Papers: MSS. TY
                        7/1802, 1803, 1985; TY 8/59” (396-97n7), with no indication of what
                        the manuscripts represent.</p>
          <p>This was so precise that I drafted a note incorporating the priapic
                        information to be added to the <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> (2nd ed.)
                        addenda. In the meanwhile I obtained reproductions of these Townley papers.

          <p>A hitherto unrecorded reference to William Blake (although with the wrong
                        first initial) appears in the <hi rend="i">New Monthly Magazine</hi> for 1
                        January 1815 (vol. 2 [1814]: 537). Headed “Intelligence in Literature
                        and the Arts and Sciences,” it reads: “Mr. Flaxman has
                        finished a series of compositions in outline from Hesiod’s Works,
                        which will be engraved by Mr. J. Blake, and printed in folio, to correspond
                        with the outlines from Homer, by the same eminent professor.”</p>
          <p>The volume number and year appear anomalous because the first issue for 1815
                        was paginated as part of the volume for 1814. <hi rend="i">The Theogony,
                            Works and Days, and the Days of Hesiod</hi>, with 37 plates engraved by
                        William Blake after Flaxman’s designs, was published in 1817 by
                        Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme &amp; Brown. The <hi rend="i">New
                        Monthly</hi>’s mistake about Blake’s first initial may be an
                        indication of how obscure he was in what Gilchrist called his “years
                        of deepening neglect.”</p>
