                    mainly Londoners, many of them drawn from the ranks of the Royal Academy and
                    Royal Society and several of whom played significant roles in Blake’s
                    life. Sir Humphrey Davy was called on to provide the articles on Chemistry. John
                    Bonny-castle, a friend of Henry Fuseli, wrote some of the Astronomy sections.
                    The musicologist, Sir Charles Burney, did not refrain from including a facsimile
                    of a hand-written score from Rousseau—his counterpart for the <hi rend="i">Encyclopedie.</hi> Major Moor, whose illustrated <hi rend="i">Hindu

                    Mushett was the authority on blast furnaces, yet he mentions not a word about
                    the blacksmith Los. Benjamin Malkin, a friend and sometime employer of Blake,
                    wrote a few of the biographical articles for which the <hi rend="i">Cyclopaedia</hi> was specially noted.<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref>
                    The articles on painting were prepared by Thomas Phillips, who once had Blake

                    amplification of his "Lectures" at the Royal Academy. Among the

        <p>Blake himself was to join in the work on Rees’ <hi rend="i">Cyclopaedia</hi> with this "eminent" and
                    "distinguished" company of men. At a time when Blake was living in
                    poverty and obscurity, John Flaxman steered an occasional job his way. They were
                    not always very satisfactory opportunities for one of the geniuses of the age,
                    but engraving a "butter boat" for Josiah Wedgwood’s catalogue
                    did out some food in the larder and porter on the table.<ref target="n8" type="note">8</ref> In 1815 Flaxman enlisted Blake to do the engravings for
                    his "Sculpture" article, and also for "Armour," "Basso
                    Relievo," and "Gem Engraving."<ref target="n9" type="note">9</ref> The four plates of the engravings for "Sculpture" include
                    the old standards of Greek statuary: the Apollo Belvedere, the Medici Venus, the
                    Knidian Aphrodite of Praxiteles, the Hercules Farnese, Jupiter Olympius the
                    Athena Parthenos of Phidias, the Laocoön, and <pb id="p15-157" n="157"/>

                    statue at Thebes, a droll Chinese statue, and two examples of Persian sculpture
                    from Persepolis. The plates in Rees are mere copywork, with perhaps one
                    exception, the Jupiter Olympius, which stands out among the collection of gods,
                    goddesses, and heroes. This stipple engraving of Jupiter is more concentrated,
                    inventive, and minutely detailed than the rest, including the Laocoön
                    which is certainly fainter by comparison.<ref target="n10" type="note">10</ref><note id="n8"><hi rend="s">8</hi> G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake

        <p>Before treating Blake’s representation of the Jupiter Olympius, some
                    background on the statue itself and its place in the history of art will provide
                    a context for Blake’s work. Phidias’ statue of Zeus in the Temple
                    at Elis, the site of the Olympic games, was one of the seven wonders of the
                    ancient world. Strabo reports that when asked "after what model he was
                    going to make the likeness of Zeus, [Phidias] replied that he was going to make
                    it after the likeness set forth by Homer in these words: ‘Cronion spake,
                    and nodded assent with dark brows, and then the ambrosial locks flowed streaming
                    from the lord’s immortal head, and he caused great Olympus to
                    quake’ (<hi rend="i">Iliad</hi> I. 528)" (<hi rend="i">Geography</hi> viii. 3.30). John Flaxman describes the statue this way in
                    his <hi rend="i">Lectures</hi>: <q> But the great work of this chief of
                        sculptors, the astonishment and praise of after ages, was the Jupiter at
                        Elis, sitting on his throne, his left hand holding a scepter, his right
                        extending victory to the Olympian conquerors, his head crowned with olive,
                        and his pallium decorated with birds, beasts, and flowers. The four corners
                        of the throne were dancing victories, each supported by a sphinx, tearing a
                        Theban youth. At the back of the throne, above his head, were the three
                        hours or seasons on one side, and on the other the three graces. On the bar
                        between the legs of the throne, and the panels or spaces between them were
                        represented many stories. . . . On the base the battle of Theseus with the
                        Amazons; on the pedestal, an assembly of the gods, the sun and moon in their
                        cars, and the birth of Venus. The height of the work was sixty feet. The
                        statue was ivory, enriched with the radiance of golden ornaments and
                        precious stones.<ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref> (illus. 2) <note id="n11"><hi rend="s">11</hi> The account is based on Pausanias’

        <p>Prodigies were associated with the statue from the beginning. In his <hi rend="i">Description of Greece</hi>, Pausanias relates "that the god himself
                    evinced his approbation of the art of Phidias; for, as soon as the statue was
                    finished, Phidias prayed to Jupiter, and entreated him to signify if the work
                    was pleasing to his divinity; and immediately after he prayed, they say, that
                    part of the pavement was struck by <figure><head>1 Rees <hi rend="i">Cyclopaedia.</hi></head><figDesc>"Sculpture," Plate I.</figDesc></figure><figure><head>2 "Jupiter Olympius."</head></figure><pb id="p15-158" n="158"/> lightning."<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> Martin Robertson notes that "the floor in front was paved
                    with black marble and there was a reflecting pool of oil that not only served to
                    preserve the ivory but to cast light up on and reflect the figure."<ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref> The seated figure filled the space, his
                    lofty head almost touching the ceiling. Imagine the effect on a suppliant when
                    the towering statue doubled in an eerie light! The effect was to induce a state
                    of religious awe attested to by Dio Chrysostom, for one: <q> O best and noblest
                        of artists, how charming and pleasing a spectable you have wrought, and a

                        he stood before this image, would forget all the terrors and hardships that
                        fall to our human lot. Such a wondrous vision did you devise and fashion,

        <p>The statue itself had a curious history. For six centuries it remained at Elis,
                    revered by Greeks, Romans, and barbarians alike, such was its universal power.
                    Caligula attempted to have the statue carried off to Rome to adorn the imperial
                    city, but Suetonius reports that the statue "suddenly uttered such a peal
                    of laughter that the scaffoldings collapsed and the workmen took to their
                    heels" (<hi rend="i">The Lives of the Caesars</hi>, IV, 57). The Emperor
                    Theodosius was more successful in plundering the temple. In 373 A. D. he
                    abolished the Olympic Games and profaned the temple of Zeus when he had the
                    chryselephantine statue expropriated to New Rome (Constantinople).<ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref> There it joined in captivity the Knidian
                    Aphrodite of Praxiteles, the Eros of Mindos by Lysippus, and many other
                    masterpieces by Greek artists. A quote from Blake’s "On Virgil"
                    makes apt comment here: "A war-like State never can produce Art. It will
                    Rob &amp; Plunder &amp; accumulate into one place &amp; Translate &amp; Copy

                    of art were irrevocably lost in the disaster, including the Zeus and other works

        <p>In Blake’s era Phidias and his Olympian Zeus were highly esteemed.

                        Greeks</hi>, translated by Fuseli, gives the highest place to Phidias:
                    "The Zeus of Phidias was the standard of sublimity, the symbol of the
                    omnipresent Deity, like Homer’s Eris, he stood upon the earth, and
                    reached heaven."<ref target="n18" type="note">18</ref> In Joseph

                    the ancient artists endeavoured to express in his countenance. If some of the
                    nobler statues of Jupiter, as that of Jupiter Olympus made by Phidias, in
                    particular, had remained to our times; we might see this more strongly at
                    present; for that was reckoned the master-piece of the greatest statuary that
                    ever was; and those who beheld it are said to have been astonished at the
                    greatness of ideas in it."<ref target="n19" type="note">19</ref> The desire

        <p>Though Blake took exception to the uninspired opinions of his patron William
                    Hayley, he would not have quarreled with the gentleman’s estimation of
                    Phidias. Hayley had finished his <hi rend="i">Essay on Sculpture</hi> just
                    before Blake came to work for him in 1800. In lock-step heroic couplets he
                    describes how he is taken "in vision" to see the Zeus; then he
                    addressed Phidias: <q> All vouch thy fame, though not in speech—<lb/>
                        Thine, the prime glory pagan minds could reach—<lb/> Thine, to have
                        form’d, in superstition’s hour,<lb/> The noblest semblance of

        <p>In 1800 John Flaxman was the "Happy son of the immortal Phidias" to
                    Blake (Letters, K 807). Flaxman’s thoughts on his spiritual father are
                    giver in the "Sculpture" article in Rees’ <hi rend="i">Cyclopaedia</hi>: "Superior genius, in addition to a knowledge of
                    painting, which he practiced before sculpture, gave a grandeur to his
                    compositions, a grace to his groups, a softness to flesh, and a flow to
                    draperies, unknown to his predecessors . . . . The discourse of contemporary
                    philosophers on mental and personal perfection assisted him in selecting and
                    combining ideas, which stamped his work with the sublime and beautiful of
                    Homer’s verse. . . . The great work of the great master, the astonishment
                    and praise of after ages, was the Jupiter at Elis."<ref target="n21" type="note">21</ref> From ancient commentary to Blake’s own friends
                    the preeminence and power of Phidias were celebrated, and in 1815 Blake got the

                    plates in Rees’ <hi rend="i">Cyclopaedia.</hi> Blake engraved the plate,
                    but it is not entirely clear whether it was Blake, Flaxman, or the two together
                    who worked out the design of the picture. Spence outlines the problem facing the
                    artist: "It is a great pity that we have no better figures of Jupiter . . .
                    they fall short even of the idea one can form of a Jupiter in one’s own
                    mind, by the help of ancient poets, and infinitely short of the celebrated
                    Jupiter made by Phidias."<ref target="n22" type="note">22</ref> Here was a
                    chance to create a likeness of Jupiter and in a way "to renew the lost Art
                    of the Greeks," a one-time ambition of Blake (Letters, K 792). <note id="n22"><hi rend="s">22</hi> Spence, p. 46.</note></p>

        </figure>
        <p>In addition to the imaginative powers of the designer, there were other sources
                    for the engraving: traditional representations of Jupiter, the Hellenistic
                    statue of Jupiter in Marbury Hall, and a literary description in the writings of
                    Pausanias. The engraving in the <hi rend="i">Polymetis</hi> exemplifies the
                    standard iconography associated with Jupiter (illus. 3). In the Marbury Hall
                    Zeus we have a likely model for the basic attitudes of the Jupiter in Rees
                    (illus 4). The torso, beard, and especially the pallium are similar, though the
                    body is more symmetrically arranged in Blake.</p>
        <p>For the fine detail in the engraving, we are directed to "See
                    Pausanias," whose <hi rend="i">Description of Greece</hi> contains a
                    minutely detailed verbal portrait of the famed statue. The engraving follows
                    almost verbatim the description, of which Flaxman quotes the relevant sections
                    in his Sculpture article. In giving Pausanias’ account I have added a
                    [Y]-yes- and an [N]-no-to indicate whether the engraving follows the
                    description. As the picture is black and white/two-dimensional, some qualities
                    of the sculpture do not apply: "The god is seated upon his throne [Y], made
                    of gold and ivory, a crown of olive branch on his head [Y], in his right hand
                    bearing a Victory [Y], also of ivory and gold; she bears a fillet, and is
                    crowned [Y-but the olive crown is in her right hand]; the left hand of the <figure><head>4 Marbury Hall Zeus, courtesy of the J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu,
                            California.</head></figure> god holds a sceptre of various coloured metals [Y]; an eagle of gold
                    sitting upon the sceptre [Y]; his garment is of gold, and on his garment are
                    wrought animals and flowers, particularly the lily [N<ref target="n23" type="note">23</ref>]; his sandals are of gold; the throne is variously
                    ornamented with gold and gems, and also ivory and ebony: on it animals are
                    painted in their proper colours, and sculptured with great labour [These
                    pictures on the sides and back of the work are not shown in the frontal view of
                    the engraving]. Four victories, as in the dance, are on the hinder feet on the
                    throne, two on each side [Y-two of the four are brought forward]; and on the
                    front the children of the Thebans taken away by the sphynx [Y] . . . .
                    [Pausanias goes on to describe numerous scenes that surround the statue but are
                    not included in the engraving]. Upon the throne, above the head of the god,
                    Phidias carved the Graces and the Hours [Y]. <pb id="p15-160" n="160"/> Three of
                    them large; these are called daughters of Jove. [Three of these Graces form the
                    outer ring of the halo-arch over Jupiter’s head. Two, though there should
                    be three, cherubs make the inner ring]." It is evident that the engraving
                    is based on this description, but as to the character and expression of the
                    Jupiter there is more to say. <note id="n23"><hi rend="s">23</hi> This detail is
                        followed in Flaxman’s designs to the <hi rend="i">Iliad</hi>,
                        (London, 1805), plate 5.</note></p>
        <p>A quote from Homer that Phidias did not note as a source of his inspiration still
                    felicitously describes this Jupiter: "He, whose all-conscious Eyes the
                    World behold, / Th’ Eternal Thunderer, sate thron’d in Gold"
                        (<hi rend="i">Iliad</hi> VIII, 550-51).<ref target="n24" type="note">24</ref> The face radiates omniscience and the symmetrical features
                    indicate harmony. The heroic torso, firmly-set feet, and symbols of power all
                    combine to picture majesty of character. Even the beard contributes to the
                    effect. Spence comments on this point: "What is nobler than the long beard
                    in Michaelangelo’s Moses? A full beard surely may give majesty as well as
                    a long one, and you see, in effect, how much it gives . . . . to the heads of
                    the Greek Jupiters . . . . A full beard still carries the idea of majesty with
                    it, all over the East; which it may possibly have had ever since the times of
                    the patriarchal government there. The Grecians had a share of the oriental
                    notion of it."<ref target="n25" type="note">25</ref> Power inhabits the
                    Jupiter from the head, with its flame-like laurel wreath, to the feet where the

        <p>Still there is not much sign of the wrathful, terrible thunderer in this picture.
                    Spence explains how the benevolent aspect befits this deity: <q> Among the
                        different characters of Jupiter, I think I have mentioned to you those of
                        the Mild and of the Terrible Jupiter . . . Mild Jupiter’s face has a
                        mixture of dignity and ease in it. That serene and sweeter kind of majesty .
                        . . The statues of the Terrible Jupiter were represented in every particular
                        differently from those of the Mild Jupiters. These were generally of black
                        marble, as those were of white. The one is sitting with an air of
                        tranquility; the other, is standing and more or less disturbed. The face of
                        one, is pacific and serene; of the other angry or clouded. On the heads of
                        one, the hair is regular and composed; in the other, it is so discomposed
                        that it falls half-way down the forehead.<ref target="n26" type="note">26</ref><note id="n26"><hi rend="s">26</hi><hi rend="i"> Ibid.</hi></note></q><pb id="p15-161" n="161"/> The "Terrible Jupiters" have distant
                    cousins in the truculent demons that guard the gates of many Hindu and Buddhist
                    temples; but in this engraving we are certainly presented with a "Mild
                    Jupiter."</p>
        <p>The combination of strength and benevolence evident in the statue is further
                    explicated from the glosses of Thomas Taylor: "‘Jupiter is seen
                    holding a sceptre, and [winged] victory.’ Jupiter is every where called
                    by Homer . . . ‘the father of gods and men, ruler and king, and the
                    supreme of rulers . . . ’ On account, therefore, of his <hi rend="i">commanding</hi> or <hi rend="i">ruling</hi> characteristic, he is very
                    properly represented with a sceptre, which is certainly an obvious symbol of
                    command. The symbol of victory likewise justly belongs to him, on account of his
                    all-subduing power, which vanquishes all mundane opposition, and causes the war
                    of the universe to terminate in peace."<ref target="n27" type="note">27</ref> Hayley declaimed the virtues of the peace-bestower in his <hi rend="i">Essay on Sculpture</hi>: <q> Lo, in calm pomp, with Art’s

        <p>The divine nature of the subject is emphasized by the arrangement of Graces and
                    Seasons about Jupiter’s head. The halo-effect of the attending Graces and
                    Seasons is <hi rend="i">not</hi> accounted for in Pausanias; in fact he mentions
                    that they are disposed to the right and left of Jupiter’s head. Haloes
                    around the heads of pagan gods are found elsewhere in eighteenth and nineteenth
                    century art,<ref target="n29" type="note">29</ref> but the effect in this
                    picture certainly contributes to the portrayal of Jupiter as a Prince of Peace.
                    This Jupiter is neither a despotic Greek god nor a tyrannical Urizen. Blake
                    himself says forthrightly: "Consider that the Venus, the Minerva, the
                    Jupiter, the Apollo . . . are all of them representations of spiritual
                    existences, of Gods immortal to the mortal perishing organ of sight; and yet
                    they are embodied and organized in solid marble" (<hi rend="i">Descriptive
                        Catalogue</hi>, K 576). A representation of celestial power has here been
                    embodied and organized in dots of ink. <note id="n29"><hi rend="s">29</hi>
                        Flaxman’s <hi rend="i">Iliad</hi>, plate 9, and <hi rend="i">Odyssey</hi>, plate 1, are two examples, the styles of which contrast
                        with the halo in Rees.</note></p>
        <p>On the base of the Jupiter statue is a picture of a bas-relief in such minute
                    detail as to call for a magnifying glass (illus. 5). The Lilliputian beings
                    outlined in dots are a company of Olympian gods that appear more the size of
                    fairies. Once again the artist has stayed close to the description in Pausanias,
                    which allows us to identify the characters: "Upon the base of the throne,
                    which great mass was wrought in gold, are other ornaments relating <figure><head>6 Blake’s drawing for Rees’ sculpture plate, courtesy of

                    Jupiter [3] and Juno [2], and by them the Graces [4,5,6]; these lead Hermes [7],
                    and Hermes Vesta [8]. Cupid [9] also from the sea receiving Venus [10], who was
                    crowned by Persuasion [11]. Apollo was with Diana [Apollo is subsumed in the
                    rising Sun and Diana with the Moon-12], and Minerva with Hercules [neither
                    pictured]; and on the lowest part of all was Neptune, [13-Blake’s image
                    here is in the attitude of the Capitoline Neptune], and the Moon [12] in her
                    chariot urging on her horses."<ref target="n30" type="note">30</ref> A
                    noteworthy improvisation from the description is the Sun driving his chariot led
                    by a team of vigorous horses, while the Moon’s team grazes, thereby
                    emphasizing the active/passive contraries of day and night. Hermes’
                    costume could almost make him a medieval jester. Besides being the guide of
                    souls to the underworld, he is also the patron of tricksters. <note id="n30"><hi rend="s">30</hi><hi rend="i"> Cyclopaedia</hi>, "Sculpture," not

        <p>Finally there is the matter of who designed the "Jupiter Olympius"
                    engraving. There is no identification of the designer on the plate itself. When
                    Flaxman designed the "Basso Relievo" plate in 1804, he was credited
                    with it and James Parker with the engraving. "Blake del[iniavit] et
                    sc[ulpsit]," in Rees’ Plate III with the Laocoön tells us
                    Blake drew the picture and engraved it. On Rees’ Plate I with the Jupiter
                    simply appears "Blake sc." He engraved the plate, but the designer is
                    not mentioned. Blake did make a rather finished preliminary drawing of the whole
                    page that Frederick Tatham described as "exquisite" (illus. 6).<ref target="n31" type="note">31</ref> Blake’s drawing of the page is not
                    conclusive proof that he designed it, for he may have been working from a prior
                    drawing by Flaxman. Still, the existence of the drawing makes it likely that he
                    had a hand in the design, and two differences between the drawing and the final
                    engraving itself make it even more likely: (1) In the bas-relief on the base
                    Neptune is moved from the left foreground to the right. (2) The Moon-goddess is
                    moved closer to Vesta and her right arm is raised. Blake probably made these
                    changes as he understood the need to balance the groupings more effectively.
                        <note id="n31"><hi rend="s">31</hi> With the Greek quotation translated, the
                        text in Tatham’s hand reads: "The Glory round the Head of this
                        superb Jove is composed of figures. That noble God-like head puts us in mind
                        of these sublime lines from Homer. ‘Cronion spake and nodded assent
                        with dark brows, and then the ambrosial locks flowed streaming from the
                        lord’s immortal head, and he caused great Olympus to quake’
                            [<hi rend="i">Iliad</hi> I.528]. This exquisite Drawing is by William
                        Blake-made &amp; afterwards Engraved for the Encyclopaedia for which
                        Flaxman wrote the article on Sculpture. Frederick Tatham." In Martin
                        Butlin, <hi rend="i">The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</hi> (New
                        Haven and London: Yale Univ. Press, 1981), this drawing is 678A recto, pl.
                        896A; the verso is reproduced as pl. 897.</note></p>
        <p>If a design was provided it would most probably have been by Flaxman. When his
                        <hi rend="i">Lectures</hi> were published in 1838, sculture plates from his
                    drawings were included. While there is a basic similarity in the two engravings
                    of Jupiter, Flaxman’s picture of "Jupiter Olympus at Elis"
                    (illus. 7) differs <hi rend="i">markedly</hi> from the Rees Jupiter: (1) The
                    expression of the face and drawing of hair and beard are clearly different. (2)
                    The eagle, sphinxes, and victims are more detailed. (3) There is no halo effect
                    of Graces and Seasons. (4) The statue is placed in a temple setting with roof
                    and walls. (5) The design of the bas-relief differs by being quite vague, and
                    the Moon is driving a chariot pulled by two active horses. while Flaxman could
                    have done another drawing, this Flaxman design was <hi rend="i">not</hi> the
                    basis of the Rees engraving.</p>
        <p>The mild Jupiter that dwells in the dusty precincts of an outmoded household
                    encyclopaedia reveals many elements of Greek religion and thought. Although
                    Blake’s attitude towards the Greeks shifted from admiration to distrust
                    between 1800 and 1815, his deft execution of the Jupiter Olympius engraving
                    belies a dogmatic dismissal of Greek tradition. This miniature colossus invites
                    contemplation by any who would like a glimpse of one of the sculptural wonders
                    of the Golden Age.</p>

                    chariot of inspiration, a pen, the river Severn, arsenic, the soul, desire, the
                    body (or Generation), Blake himself as poet-painter.<ref target="n33" type="note">2</ref> By far the most elaborate of these interpretations is
                    Erdman’s commentary in <hi rend="i">The Illuminated Blake</hi> on plate
                    11 of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, which is the only one to really try to come
                    to grips with that puzzling design by seeing it as a sublime allegory of
                    Blake’s marriage of copper-plate etching (of text and design) and the
                    printing and coloring of that design on paper. Since the <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> plate is especially complex, let me leave it aside for a
                    moment to deal with some "simoler" swans. <note id="n32"><hi rend="s">1</hi><hi rend="i"> The Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>, ed. David V. Erdman

        <p>According to the Blake concordance there are only two swans in his writings,
                    neither apparently remarkable enough to elicit any comment except from Kathleen
                    Raine who, in glossing the "bright swan" of <hi rend="i">Visions of
                        the Daughters of Albion</hi> (plate 3), identifies the whole scene as
                    Plotinian, the swan as "Plato’s emblem of the soul," here
                    dipping "its wing in the ‘red earth’ of the natural body,
                    which is the ever-flowing river of generated life."<ref target="n34" type="note">3</ref> Although it is certainly possible that Blake was aware
                    of this Neoplatonic interpretation of the <hi rend="i">Phaedo</hi>,
                    Raine’s gloss on the <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> passage (3:18-19; E 46)
                    commits precisely the same error that so frustrates Oothoon in
                    Theotormon’s reaction to her rape and "defilement" by Bromion.
                    Her invoking of the swan here is not to corroborate such simplistic body-soul
                    dichotomizing but to counteract it. The swan is but one of three parallel
                    images, the others being fruit and lamb. As the worm feeds on the sweetest
                    fruit, she argues, so is the "new wash’d lamb ting’d with the
                    village smoke" and "the bright swan / By the red earth" of the
                    river of life (that is, by the red clay of Esau-Edom in Genesis 25:25-30). But
                    unlike these, she says, "How can I be defild when I reflect thy image
                    pure?" Adopting Theotormon’s mistaken orientation, she turns it
                    against itself: unlike the swan "I bathe <hi rend="i">my</hi> wings. / And
                    I am white and pure"—Blake’s grammatical construction here
                    denying a cause and effect relationship. She <hi rend="i">is</hi> sullied to
                    Theotormon’s morally jaundiced eye but to hers, bathing in "our
                    immortal river" leaves no residue of "generation’s" slow
                    stain. The seed of Oothoon’s conception, perhaps even the seed of
                    Blake’s entire conception in the <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>, is in <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>: "As the catterpiller
                    chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on
                    the fairest joys"; but "The soul of sweet delight, can never be
                    defil’d"—by village smoke, red earth, or hypocritical moral

        <p>Oothoon’s swan, then, is not the Platonic soul but rather an image of her
                    eternal imaginative individuality, her fundamental and divine ("pure")
                    humanness in its "eternal joy" (8:8). In Raine’s footnote to
                    her Plotinian interpretation, however, she superimposes upon it an allusion to
                    Plato that does lead us in a direction pertinent to virtually all of
                    Blake’s swan images, even as it leads us further and further away from
                        <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>: "The soul of
                    Orpheus," she reminds us, "enters the body of a swan, in the myth in
                    the tenth book of the <hi rend="i">Republic</hi> (620A); but this is usually
                    understood in a symbolic sense, the swan being the emblem of the poet."<ref target="n36" type="note">5</ref> While the Orpheusswan connection in the <hi rend="i">Republic</hi> is clear, there is <pb id="p15-165" n="165"/> no
                    evidence so far as I know that that connection evolved into an iconographical
                    (or even mythological) tradition. Nevertheless, the fact that Orpheus was an
                    especial favorite of Apollo’s (some said even his son) validates the swan
                    association in that the bird was sacred to him. As Robert J. Clements points
                    out, the most popular symbol of the poet in the Renaissance was the swan, its
                    consistent linkage to Apollo according it prophetic powers.<ref target="n37" type="note">6</ref> Blake’s intimate knowledge of Renaissance emblem

                    "the bible of emblem books" [p. 785])—as well as any number of
                    their imitators—all identify the swan with Apollo, the poet, poesy,
                    prophecy. <note id="n36"><hi rend="s">5</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake and Tradition</hi>, I, 410-11. While, as almost all
                        critics note, Plato is clearly the source of Shelley’s
                        "Enchanted Boat" lyric, with its swan, in <hi rend="i">Prometheus
                            Unbound</hi>, the application of his imagery to Blake is justifiable
                        only if one is indifferent to Blake’s unalterable opposition to the
                        ideas that inform Plato’s conception. Besides, Raine ignores
                        Plato’s explanation of Orpheus’s metamorphosis: his soul
                        "chose" the swan because of hatred for womankind (since women had
                        killed and dismembered him) and because therefore he did not wish to be
                        conceived and born of woman. Cf. Wither’s emblem of Ganymede astride

        <p>The only other instance of a swan in Blake’s writings seems to argue
                    further for his awareness of this tradition, even if not for a specific textual
                    or emblem source. In <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> Urizen, fallen and
                    "shut up in the deep dens of Urthona," spills out his "Woes"
                    in a lament for the lost Eden: <q> My fountains once the haunt of Swans now
                        breed the scaly tortoise<lb/> The houses of my harpers are become a haunt of
                        crows<lb/> The gardens of wisdom are become a field of horrid graves<lb/>
                        And on the bones I drop my tears &amp; water them in vain (Night V, E 336)
                    </q> The fact that Urizen is associated in the remainder of this Night with
                    Apollo and the chariot of the sun solidifies the allusion, Blake of course
                    transforming both the Apollo and Orpheus myths (which he knew probably from
                    Ovid) into the fall of all Art. Though the fallen prophet’s tonque (or
                    the voice of wisdom) remains eloquent, <q> in vain the voice<lb/> Of Urizen in

                        VI, E 341) </q> More impressive evidence of Blake’s knowledge of the
                    swan of emblem literature, however, is in the most regal of all his graphic
                    swans, that adorning the titlepage of his illustrations to Gray’s poems.
                    The caption is "The Pindarick Genius recieving his Lyre," the latter
                    descending from the sky to the youthful poet who is riding the swan with so
                    loose a rein that he virtually gives it its head. Blake, of course, may be
                    merely echoing here Pindar’s common characterization as the "Theban
                        Swan,"<ref target="n39" type="note">8</ref> for he has indicated
                    elsewhere that he was reasonably familiar, if not with Pindar’s poetry
                    directly, with his reputation and the legends and stories about him. <note id="n39"><hi rend="s">8</hi> Gray himself, however, whose steady praise of
                        Pindar and his own writing of "Pindarics" Blake obviously knew
                        well, describes Pindar as the "Theban Eagle . . . / Sailing with
                        supreme dominion / Thro’ the azure deep of air" ("The
                        Progress of Poesy," 1. 115—subtitled "Pindaric" with
                        an epigraph from Pindar). Gray’s note to the passage simply says that
                        "Pindar compares himself to that bird." The swan epithet belongs
                        to the family of Mantuan Swan and Swan of Avon, though it was Cowley who
                        attached the swan to Pindar (noted by Roger Lonsdale, <hi rend="i">The Poems
                            of Thomas Gray, William Collins, Oliver Goldsmith</hi> [London: Longman,
                        1969], p. 176). That attachment is echoed by Denham in his "On Mr.
                        Abraham Cowley." Irene Tayler, in <hi rend="i">Blake’s
                            Illustrations to the Poems of Gray</hi> (Princeton: Princeton University
                        Press, 1971), identifies the swan of Blake’s titlepage to Gray as
                        "Apollo’s bird" (p. 22).</note></p>
        <p>In <hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon</hi>, for example, Suction asks at one
                    point "if Pindar was not a better Poet than Ghiotto was a Painter" (E
                    444), but the question is never answered in the ensuing squabble over whether
                    Plutarch, who quotes Pindar but says little about him, was prejudiced against
                    Italians. There is little evidence in the context that Blake knew much more
                    about Plutarch than that he wrote "lives"—though it’s
                    interesting at least to recall, in connection with the poet-prophet idea, the
                    comic discussion in Chapter 3 of <hi rend="i">An Island</hi> of
                    "Phebus," who was, among other things according to Obtuse Angle, the
                    "God of . . . Painting, Perspective . . . Phraseology . . . Mythology . . .
                    in short every art &amp; science adorn’d him as beads round his
                    neck." He also "understood Engraving"—though in the course
                    of the insane conversation he ultimately is confused with Pharoah.<ref target="n40" type="note">9</ref> Blake’s only other mention of Pindar
                    by name is in an inscription on one of his pencil drawings: "Corinna the
                    Rival of Pindar Corinna the Graecian Poetess."<ref target="n41" type="note">10</ref> The allusion here is to the story that Pindar in his youth was
                    defeated in a poetical contest by Corinna, who then advised him to use more
                    mythology in his poems; when he did so she ungraciously criticized his using it
                    too profusely. The suggestiveness of this Pindar-lyre-swan-genius association
                    (occurring as it does about 1797 when Flaxman commissioned the Gray series for a
                    gift to his wife)<ref target="n42" type="note">11</ref> is strengthened by the
                    earlier appearance in <hi rend="i">America</hi> of a comparable swan (plate 11),
                    like the Gray swan being ridden with gentle—though not quite so
                    gentle—rein. Erdman describes this one as hastening "from
                    Albion’s fires . . . to safer homes inland" (<hi rend="i">IB</hi>,
                    149), though such action seems hardly to demonstrate prophetic power or
                    fortitude. (If indeed the swan-rider is fleeing "the British bombardment of
                    coastal towns" as Erdman claims, we might wonder why he heads East instead
                    of West, as the fleeing family in plate 3 does.) Yet Erdman does identify the
                    rider as an Orc-Los "image," as Samuel Adams (that is,
                    "Boston’s Angel" who speaks the prophetic words of plate 11),
                    Tom Paine, and "the poet himself in disguise . . . like Horace." While
                    his additional idea of this being a "pen swan" may not be as
                    far-fetched as it sounds on the surface, Erdman’s Horatian reference is
                    most unfortunate. Horace did prophesy his poetic immortality in the context of
                    feeling himself turning into a swan (surely echoing Socrates), but it is hard to
                    imagine any poet who would serve less well as a prophetic model, or indeed any
                    kind of poetic model, for Blake. The fact is, of course, that Horace is alluding
                    to the very tradition Blake himself is making use of. Erdman is right: the rider
                    is the poet, prophet, Blake—riding Eastward toward the advancing
                    "dragon form" of "Albion’s wrathful Prince" (<hi rend="i">America</hi> 3:14-15). <note id="n40"><hi rend="s">9</hi> E 442-43.

        <p>As attractive as all this may be, one may still wonder about the swan’s
                    being bridled, however gently.<ref target="n43" type="note">12</ref> If indeed
                    its rider here is Orc-like, as his origins in the fiery figure of plate 10
                    suggest, what we have in the total icon is poesy or prophecy being pressed by
                    its rider into the violent action of bloody battle and the final loosing of
                    plagues, "fierce disease and lust" (16:21) on England, a holocaust
                    totally out of keeping with Apollo, Orpheus, the "Pindarick Genius,"
                    poetry, and prophecy as Blake understood them. It is instead <pb id="p15-166" n="166"/> prophecy perverted to war-song, one of the things he saw happening
                    in Gray as well. Is this why the rider looks back, doubletaking his own violent
                    image as well as the lost Eden of Atlantis on the previous plate? And is this
                    why, as it seems to me, the swan strains at the rein? The contrasting view is
                    seen in the serpent figure at the bottom of the page, which Erdman properly sees
                    as smilingly attentive to its riders, so limply reined as to be free (note the
                    limp arm of the rein-holder as distinct from the sharply tensed wrist of the
                        swan-rider),<ref target="n44" type="note">13</ref> its tail spiralling off
                    into infinity-eternity, its riders "in long drawn arches sitting"
                    feeling "the nerves of youth renew" (15:24-25). These riders, we
                    should note, reverse (and hence annihilate) time through the true prophecy of
                    the serpent, Blake moving us from the youthful rein-holder back to child back to
                    infant back to the prophetic coils of the snake’s tail, repeating almost
                    exactly the curlicue soaring upward from the "P" of
                    "Prophecy" on plate 3,<ref target="n45" type="note">14</ref> growing
                    "vitally upward in endless communication that expands into words and
                    poetry" (<hi rend="i">IB</hi>, 143). Erdman himself seems to sense
                    something of the falseness of the Orc-prophecy and the dawning of Los-like
                    vision in his commentary on the "Preludium": "The poem beginning
                    on Plate 3 presents a potentially cyclic revolution of rise and fall, rebellion
                    and enslavement, threatening a perpetual dull round";<ref target="n46" type="note">15</ref> and also in his interpretation of the "Finis"
                    design at the foot of plate 16, corroborating my reading of the serpent-swan
                    opposition on plate 11: "Coiling among thorny but blossoming red roses, his
                    head another rosebud, he directs his tongue in the proper prophetic position . .

                        vision. The reins will become the bound and outward circumference of

                        of that. Prince Hal’s vaulting into the saddle, "turning and
                        winding" Pegasus, and "witch[ing] the world with noble

The bridled swan, like Essick’s
                        potentially (or necessarily) bridled Pegasus, has its counterpart in the
                        Gray titlepage, which may, then, be a satiric rather than complimentary
                        portrait. In fact, the poet of the title-page may be seen as an idealized
                        portrait of Blake himself (the Gray of plate 2 is at least reminiscent of
                        Gray’s profile, and in any case is most unlike the face of the
                        "Genius"). Tayler, in <hi rend="i">Blake’s Illustrations to
                            . . . Gray</hi>, takes no note of the differences but does certify plate
                        2 as "strikingly similar to Gray’s as it had appeared in the
                        Basire engraving done while Blake was Basire’s apprentice, and also
                        to Blake’s later pencil sketch, ‘The poet, Gray’"
                        (p. 22). My suggestion is lent credence by the final plate of the series,
                        "Gray himself, guided by his visionary illustrator," as Tayler
                        puts it (p. 146). Here Gray and Blake look alike.</note><note id="n47"><hi rend="s">16</hi><hi rend="i"> IB</hi>, 155. In Ovid as elsewhere Venus’s chariot is

        <p><hi rend="i">The Illuminated Blake</hi> indexes a number of other etched swans in
                    the early works—up through <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and
                        Hell</hi> (though I find none in "The Ecchoing Green" or on plate
                    8 of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> as indexed), none of them incontrovertible
                    except those in <hi rend="i">There Is No Natural Religion</hi> and "The
                    Little Boy lost." While it is possible that in the former (plate 8a) the
                    boy approaches the swan because it "might be ridden" (<hi rend="i">IB</hi>, 29), the text suggests it as the visible expression of the
                    increasingly unlimited desires of the reaching child. If "More! More! is
                    the cry of a mistaken soul" and "less than All cannot satisfy
                    man" (<hi rend="i">No Natural Religion</hi>, 7b), the child as he stands is
                    no better off than the reachers of <hi rend="i">No Natural Religion</hi>, 7b;
                    but as the numerically comparable plate 7a vividly suggests, that
                    "All" is the imagination that produces "the spiritual music
                    rising from the pipe of the musician" (<hi rend="i">IB</hi>, 29). In plate
                    8a, then, the swan <hi rend="i">will</hi> rise and fly freely (not, I think,
                    reined) as the Renaissance’s Poesia or Blakean prophecy in precisely the
                    same way as the mind-forged-manacled man of <hi rend="i">No Natural
                        Religion</hi> 8b rises from the morass in plate 9b. It is quite possible, of
                    course, that such a "retrospective" reading of this earliest of all
                    Blake’s swans, from the perspective of <hi rend="i">America</hi> and the
                    Gray illustrations, is an over-reading, but the nature of the prophetic tracts,
                    along with the earlier allusions to "Phebus" and Pindar in <hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon</hi> at least allow the possibility. In this
                    light Erdman must be correct about "The Little Boy lost" plate in
                    saying that the swan there, also floating behind (or in) the "y" of
                    "Boy" in the title, is a "fitter object for boy with outstretched
                    arms [precisely, one might add, in the same striding position as the <hi rend="i">No Natural Religion</hi> boy—though he moves <hi rend="i">toward</hi> the swan and is, importantly, unclad] to pursue . . . "
                        (<hi rend="i">IB</hi>, 54). And "The Little Boy lost" is, of
                    course, also a poem about erroneous perception. In both cases, then, it seems
                    proper to identify the swans, not with desire itself, but rather with the
                    prophetic, visionary, imaginative perception and art that is the product of
                    desire, and the child as the incipient poet who will not ride the swan but, like
                    Orpheus or Pindar, become it.<ref target="n48" type="note">17</ref><note id="n48"><hi rend="s">17</hi> In <hi rend="i">IB</hi> Erdman indexes a

                        Perhaps Blake’s lack of discrimination, or etched definition, here is
                        intentional? In any case, it is probably safe to say that flying swans are
                        "better" than floating ones.</note></p>
        <p>I pass over <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 71 here as a clear antiswan image,
                    bat-winged and not only firmly planted (apparently on the ground) but even
                    grovelling ridiculously and "fatuously kissing or nibbling at the
                    toes" of the Leda-like Vala (<hi rend="i">IB</hi>, 350). If she puts on his
                    knowledge with his power (both of which seem calculatedly absent in
                    Blake’s satiric portrait of the spectrous swan), both will eventuate in
                    the maze of error, prophecy become labyrinthine mystery, emanating from the
                    Vala-like figure’s head. But we cannot pass over the most troublesome of
                    all Blake’s swans, the one in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 11.</p>
        <p>Most recently David Bindman, obviously unhappy with the Erdman reading I shall
                    turn to in a moment, advanced two other interpretations of plate 11
                    (Ovid’s King Cygnus legend and the swan as the River Severn), only to
                    argue persuasively against both.<ref target="n49" type="note">18</ref> I am less
                    sceptical about Erdman’s elaborate allegory of the swan as both singing
                    and etching the plate with its beak, complemented by the swimming-flying figure
                    at the bottom of the plate producing "infinite illumination":
                    "Like the serpent of Hell [in plate 15 of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>],
                    the serpent-necked swan projects lineation. Like the eagle, the feather-finned
                    skimmer adorns the surface with living colors (needing the spectral fins while
                    the colors are wet, the feathers for rising from illustration to
                        Illumination)."<ref target="n50" type="note">19</ref> Given the text of
                    the plate, there seems to me little doubt that Erdman is on the right track,
                    however much one may balk at his wrapping up all of the plate’s minute
                    particulars so tidily. Even so, I still have some problems with his reading.
                    While the design, as he notes, is one of only ten white-line etchings in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, the text is in Blake’s usual relief etching,
                    the contrary processes married. It doesn’t really matter, then, which
                    process the swan is engaged in. What is to the point are its bubbles (acid),
                    eating into the plate, and swimming-flying through it, corroding apparent
                    surfaces away to reveal the infinite that was hid. Part of the
                    "infinite" is the text itself, which we note is under water, that is,
                    within the plate on which the swan-prophet-graver sits. The rest of the infinite
                    is the text humanized, still streaming the acidic bubbles on wrists, neck, and
                    hair (or head-dress).<ref target="n51" type="note">20</ref> At the same time,
                    although Blake repeats in this lower design the lines of the water above to
                    remind us that the swimmer is within the plate, not merely "on" it,
                    the figure is also clearly flying, arms outstretched in a familiar Blakean
                    gesture of airy freedom. In a sense, then, this is the swan, now fully humanized
                    and in full flight, no longer merely floating (or planted) in the materials of
                    the artifice but assuming total mythographic status as poet-prophet-artist as
                    well <pb id="p15-167" n="167"/> as poem-prophecy-art. The entire plate is thus
                    the Erin of the text, not merely the swimmer-flyer as Erdman suggests: "And
                    the Spaces of Erin reach’d from the starry heighth, to the starry
                    depth," the spaces that are the enabling agency for the process that will
                    eventuate in the immediately following plates (12ff). It is, to borrow Angus
                    Fletcher’s terms, the prophetic moment, space and time (Los’s
                    "pulsations of time, &amp; extensions of space" during and in which
                    he performs his "sublime Labours"—<hi rend="i">J</hi>, 11:2 and
                    10:65). That the moment does not last the text tells us, as well as the parody
                    of this visionary creative activity that is imaged in the margin of plate
                    12—for "Around Golgonooza lies the land of death eternal; a Land /
                    Of pain and misery and despair and ever brooding melancholy" (13:30-31).
                    But the moment’s augury is too powerful to be denied: the embrace of
                    plate 99 will come. <note id="n49"><hi rend="s">18</hi> Bindman, <hi rend="i">Blake as an Artist</hi>, p. 182. Erdman mentions Cygnus also, gingerly;

                        his detailed recall of his own past work is astonishing), to think that
                        Blake here remembered a part of the "Phebus" passage in <hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon</hi>: " . . . in short every art
                        &amp; science adorn’d him [Apollo] as beads around his neck" (E
                        442). Is it possible that Blake knew any of the myths of swan-maidens, which
                        appear all over Europe and in Ireland (not, so far as I know, in England),
                        and which involve, among other characteristics in common, a magical necklace
                        as not merely a talisman of swan-womanhood but the agency of the
                        transformation? See Anna Louise Frey, <hi rend="i">The Swan-Knight

                        (Nashville, 1931). Ripa has an interesting Indian with headdress and beads
                        in his "America" emblem (<hi rend="i">Baroque and Rococo Pictorial

                        any case, Aradobo and Obtuse Angle ignorantly confuse Phebus and Pharaoh,
                        and if Mrs. Sigtagatist chides them all for "making use of the names in
                        the Bible" (E 443), Blake did not hesitate to put the classical sun-god
                        in the Bible and, in the true Christian tradition, Christianize him into
                        Jesus Christ, the imagination, the archetypal Artist.</note></p>
        <p>Even if we accept the view of plate 11 that I have advanced, or some compromise
                    between it and Erdman’s, the sexes of both swan and swimmer-flyer, as
                    well as the Indian appearance of the latter still nag (on the Indian see my note
                    20). The safest answer is the one Erdman gives: "In their present
                    appearance both figures are androgynous, possibly nearer Eternity than Beulah,
                    possibly nearer Ulro" (<hi rend="i">IB</hi>, 291). Possibly. Damon sees
                    both as female, the swan "the Female Will," the lower figure
                    "Inspiration (an Emanation)," and Yeats suggests "Leda-Swan"
                    for the one, "Vala, or America, as Oothoon, taking ‘her impetuous
                    course’ o’er Theotormon’s reign" for the other.<ref target="n52" type="note">21</ref> If indeed <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 71
                    recalls the Zeus-Leda myth, as it certainly seems to, can we arbitrarily ignore
                    that myth on plate 11 and invoke Horace and King Cygnus instead? I think not. I
                    have already indicated that Horace is a most unlikely and inapropos allusion,
                    and none of the three Cygnus stories told by Ovid has the remotest connection
                    with anything on this plate—not to mention, as Bindman reminds us, that
                    Cygnus was "indubitably male."<ref target="n53" type="note">22</ref>
                    If a simple spectre-emanation contrariety were all that Blake wanted, he surely
                    would have made that clearer. What, then, does the Ledean swan have to do with
                    the Orphic swan? <note id="n52"><hi rend="s">21</hi><hi rend="i"> William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols</hi>, p. 469; Ellis
                        and Yeats, II, 357. In his admirable <hi rend="i">Blake’s Composite
                            Art</hi> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978), W. J. T.
                        Mitchell argues a similar opposition between the two figures, the
                        "prophetic swan-woman versus the fashionable goldfish-woman" (p.
                        200), part of a pattern he sees throughout <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> of
                        contrasting female images, one "the naked, sexually liberated guide . .
                        . who leads humanity to the realm of imagination and forgiveness . . . and
                        the heavily clothed Vala-sibyl who keeps her subjects’ minds . . . on
                        mundane matters" (p. 199). Mitchell seems to have in mind
                        Blake’s goldfish in his designs to Gray, and it is certainly true
                        that plate 4 of "Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat" includes two
                        figures reminiscent at least of the swimmer-flyer of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 11. I see less thematic and iconic connection here,
                        though, than in Gray’s lines on the "T-heban Eagle" Pindar
                        in "The Progress of Poesy" where he "sails" with
                        "supreme dominion / Thro’ the azure deep of air." In any
                        case, given the entire text and design, I cannot regard the two figures in
                            <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 11 as opposed to each other.</note><note id="n53"><hi rend="s">22</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake as an Artist</hi>, p. 182.</note></p>
        <p>Let us go back to Cygnus for a moment. There is an interesting connection between
                    the Leda-Swan story and Cygnus in that both have reference to the Trojan War. In
                    Book XII of the <hi rend="i">Metamorphoses</hi> Achilles, in the height of the
                    battle for Troy, seeks out Cygnus, who unknown to Achilles, has been made
                    invulnerable to spear and sword by his father Neptune. Achilles finally corners
                    him, however, pressing him against a rock, then throws him down and, kneeling on
                    his ribs, strangles Cygnus with the thongs of his own helmet. It is at that
                    moment that Neptune transforms Cygnus into a swan. As I indicated earlier, it
                    seems ridiculous to associate <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 11 with this bloody
                    story, but the collocation of Leda (who, we should recall, became Nemesis after
                    her rape), Zeus-swan, the Trojan War, Achilles, and Cygnus-swan is difficult to
                    ignore entirely. However circuitous a route this is into Blake’s
                    conception on plate 11 of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, that plate does
                    immediately precede the building of Golgonooza (as opposed to the destruction of
                    Troy), the "realizing" of true prophecy as opposed to the bloody
                    realization of "all human history flowing from" the false prophecy
                    inherent in Leda’s rape.<ref target="n54" type="note">23</ref> Although
                    the union of Zeus and Leda would seem to be especially apropos in light of
                    Blake’s woman-swan, then, its applicability, if any, must lie in his
                    transformation of Bromion-like tyranny and its consequent vengeful
                    destructiveness into the productive union of divine and human as the
                    artist-builder. Blake was not unacquainted with Homer, as we know. His antipathy
                    to the "Classics . . . that Desolate Europe with Wars" erupts angrily
                    in the 1820 etching "On Homer’s Poetry &amp; On Virgil": <q>
                        Sacred Truth has pronounced that Greece &amp; Rome as Babylon &amp; Egypt:
                        so far from being parents of Arts &amp; Sciences as they pretend: were
                        destroyers of all Art. Homer Virgil &amp; Ovid confirm this opinion. . .

                    creates, the product of a "redeemed" Leda-Swan / Los-Enitharmon being
                    not war but the corrosive spirit that burns away the apparent surfaces of
                    history to reveal the infinite "Nature of Eternal Things . . . All
                    Springing from the Divine Humanity" (<hi rend="i">A Vision of the Last

                    With no mention of Leda anywhere in Blake’s works, however, we may still
                    rest discontented with this sort of Blakean transformation of the
                    "classics" and the "detestable Gods of Priam" (<hi rend="i">Milton</hi> 14:15)—though it is worth recalling here that in such
                    influential emblem books as Ripa’s <hi rend="i">Iconologia</hi> and
                    Christophorus Giarda’s <hi rend="i">Icones symbolicae</hi>, Poesy (or
                    Poesia) is almost always a female figure, holding a lyre in one hand and a

                        scene (E 428-30). We should also recall his condemnation of Jupiter as
                        "the enemy of conjugal love . . . an iron-hearted tyrant, the ruiner of
                        ancient Greece," a "spectrous Fiend," and "the ruin of

        <p>One final suggestion about Blake’s swans, one that may have some bearing,
                    particularly, on <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 11: Spenser’s <hi rend="i">Ruines of Time</hi>—which I have already suggested Blake knew
                        well<ref target="n57" type="note">26</ref> and which includes allusions to
                    "fair Ledaes warlick twinnes" (1.386), Orpheus and Eurydice
                    (11.391-92), and the immortality of art, which laments the ruin of
                    "Verlame," and which is an elegy on the death of
                    Sidney—concludes with six verbal emblems, the first two of which may have
                    some relationship to <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 11. The first of these is
                    Sidney as a swan floating <pb id="p15-168" n="168"/> down the Thames and sweetly
                    singing "the prophecie / Of his owne death in dolefull Elegie," after

                    marvellously apt—for, as we know, "The Ruins of Time builds Mansions

                    Sidney-swan, Orpheus-harp, and Blake all demonstrate in their own respective
                    ways. In his youth Blake, imitating Spenser, called upon these detestable gods
                    of Priam—Apollo, Mercury, Jove, and Pallas Athena—but it did not
                    take him long to recognize that pantheon’s dead-endedness and to take
                    flight, in his own transmutation of part of that pantheon, as a swan.

                    readings, for example, of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 76 and 78, refining the
                    ironies of their complexity persuasively toward the positive pole.<ref target="n59" type="note">1</ref> In the Crucifixion picture (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 76), he asks, which sun is the natural sun, which the spiritual?
                    "The answer is both, or neither, because the important sunrise in the
                    picture is Albion himself, rising like Samson (whose name was translated as
                    ‘sun’), shaking off his spiritual darkness and blindness" (p.
                    211). Mitchell illustrates the point that Blake’s meaning derives from
                    "traditional renderings of the Crucifixion with St. John the Evangelist
                    (the only disciple who witnessed the Crucifixion) at the foot of the cross"
                    and whose gesture there is repeated in Blake’s "Glad Day"
                    posture—in <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi> and in the standing Albion of
                        <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 76.<ref target="n60" type="note">2</ref><note id="n59"><hi rend="s">1</hi> W. J. T. Mitchell, <hi rend="i">Blake’s Composite Art: A Study of the Illuminated Poetry</hi>

                        have encountered directly an earlier tradition from which these
                        "renderings" were derived.</note></p>
        <p>Following close after this, the melancholy, bird-headed figure in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 78 must represent living genius more positively than
                    ironists have supposed, Mitchell pleads. Here again, "the iconography of
                    St. John" as eagle-headed prophet is shown in pictorial analogues that are
                    to dispel our clouds of doubt, while the brooder’s posture is said to be
                    alluding to the symbolism of Dürer’s <hi rend="i">Melencolia
                        I.</hi> We may hesitate to agree that the emblem of Plate 78 constitutes
                    "a rather direct transposition of the description of Los in the
                    accompanying text" but are compelled to recognize that it gives this text
                    important coloring: "Los laments at his dire labours, viewing Jerusalem, /
                    Sitting before his Furnaces clothed in sackcloth of hair." In effect Albion
                    as St. John and Los as St. John are becoming one. If the eagle-man is meant also
                    to recall Hand with his "rav’ning" beak (as I suggested in <hi rend="i">The Illuminated Blake</hi>), then surely, urges Mitchell, "we
                    are seeing him transformed here from predatory adversary to prophetic ally,
                    using his eagle’s head for vision, not violence." He cites the Hand
                    of Man that "grasps firm" in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 97 and
                    reminds us that St. John is the patron saint of engravers, printers, makers of
                    books—the wheels of Hand!</p>
        <p>"It is clear that there is a great deal more to be said on the matter of the
                    presence of St. John in Blake’s verbal and visual art." Indeed there
                    must be. And Mitchell proceeds to discover his presence in that complex and
                    baffling image of the flaming giant in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 62 (illus.
                    1). Some of the components were recently clarified by Irene H. Chayes in the <hi rend="i">Bulletin</hi>, details that place this anguished giant between a
                    Polyphemus figure in Tibaldi and the figure of Giant Despair in Blake’s
                    Bunyan designs.<ref target="n61" type="note">3</ref> Mitchell suggests that the
                    giant whose body is covered by the text "is" the "‘mighty
                    angel’ whose feet are described as ‘pillars of fire’ in
                    Revelation 10:1, and the tiny figure between his feet is St. John." Before
                    the doubter can raise a hand—isn’t Blake’s giant being <hi rend="i">consumed</hi>, to free the text from his clutch?—Mitchell
                    shows us Blake’s own painting of <hi rend="i">The Angel of the
                        Revelation</hi> (illus. 2), between whose flaming legs sits, not stands (but
                    Blake in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 62 has moved from writing table to furnace)
                    a tiny St. John. One hand of the angel is "stretched downward, holding the
                    little book that St. John will consume, the other ‘lifted up . . . to
                    heaven’; Rev. 10:5." In the <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> context, of
                    course, this tiny figure is Los. In the context of <hi rend="i">The Four
                        Zoas</hi>, a similarly flaming pair of feet, on page 16 (illus. 3), are
                    identifiably Christ’s (or Luvah’s), and the alarmed little figure
                    observing them must be Vala, who exclaims: "I see <pb id="p15-171" n="171"/> not Luvah as of old I only see his feet / Like pillars of fire travelling

                        body, Bentley supposes that the feet are "not related to the large

        <p>Mitchell might have called our attention to the little figure in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 37 [41] who represents Blake as author, equipped like St.
                    John with pen and scroll but busy writing at the feet of the sleeping giant
                    Albion. This giant appears, at least, to be sleeping but may be secretly reading
                    Blake’s scroll as it crosses his belly.</p>
        <p>But other things draw Mitchell’s attention. One of these is the posture of
                    the central figure in the second titlepage of Blake’s Genesis
                        manuscript.<ref target="n63" type="note">5</ref> Here Albion/Adam is wide
                    awake and standing free, as/because he is receiving inspiration from his friend
                    Jesus (above him on his right), not in book form but as a scroll that loops
                    gracefully down from the left hand of Christ into the palm of the open right
                    hand of Adam. Most auspicious is the living flow of text from Jesus’ hand
                    through the scroll to the hand of Adam and through his body to the letters of
                    our Book, "GENESIS." In <hi rend="i">The Angel of the Revelation</hi>
                    St. John’s attention is not upon the open book in the angel’s
                    hand. He is busy writing about the seven horses and horsemen, or rather,
                    noticing with grim face the textual intrusion of the Angel’s body upon
                    his penned account of the horsemen (Rev. 9). But it is time to return our
                    attention to <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 62. <note id="n63"><hi rend="s">5</hi> Mitchell, failing to recognize this figure as Adam (as the
                            context requires), surmises that this is "one of the four figures
                            of divine inspiration" and therefore "our ‘mighty
                            angel’ of Revelation" (p. 212). Both figures have raised
                            right hands, and near Adam’s right foot is St. John as an
                            eagle-beaked "zoa." But Adam’s left hand is half
                            raised, not lowered; his feet are not in flames; his eyes do not, as the
                            angel’s, look up to heaven for inspiration but forward.
                        <p>The halo around Adam’s head does make him a sort of angel, but it
                            implies a more striking role change than that. Viewers of Blake’s
                                <hi rend="i">The Fall of Man</hi> are startled to recognize in the
                            central figure of that picture, walking forward on the earth, not an
                            angel leading Adam and Eve out of Paradise but Jesus himself, with
                            flaming halo. Now, in the Genesis titlepage, Christ gives that role to
                            Adam, the central, haloed figure standing atop the curve of the earth
                            and flanked, further back stage, by Jesus and Jehovah in luminous clouds
                            but without particular haloes. Adam’s own naked body is
                            incorporated into the design as a support for the letter
                            "I"—figleaf turned into selfhood, we might think, but
                            for the positive, flourishing spirit of the whole design.</p><p>Adam’s "head is framed by a rose-pink circle forming a kind
                            of halo behind which the red dawn of a new day is streaked across the
                            sky. With his right hand he grasps the Pledge of the Redemption from
                            Christ. The left arm is flexed at the elbow, but the hand is

                            Hennessey &amp; Ingals, 1973], illus.) The verb "grasps" is
                            wrong for Adam’s open, receptive hand; but the details and
                            identifications in this article are generally sound.</p></note></p>
        <p>As Irene Chayes has noted, the imminence of a Last Judgment is suggested by the
                    burning giant’s triple headdress of serpent, sunrays, and eyed peacock
                    feathers (with rainbow colors in the Mellon copy). "Seen in relation to the
                    page of text he is at once displaying and trying to rise out of, the giant of
                        <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 62 . . . may be the emblem of an ultimate inner
                    enlightenment and transformation that will accompany the burning away of the
                    physical body: a Last Judgment in Blake’s sense, which supplements the
                    ‘Divine Vision among the flames of the Furnaces’ (62:35) Los is
                    beholding" (p. 124). But his eyes tell us how late it is. If Adam in the
                    Genesis page looks forward with the world all before him, and the Angel of the
                    Apocalypse looks upward for guidance, the anguished giant in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 62 has almost stopped looking and has obviously begun crying
                    out. "Slanting and oval in shape," notes Chayes, "with each iris
                    diminished to a pinpoint, his already conventionalized eyes are multiplied and
                    repeated as an abstract pattern on the feathers that surround his head, as
                    though in a peacock’s fan." Among all these analogues, his is the
                    only open <hi rend="i">mouth.</hi> It is later than St. John <figure><head>1 <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 62.</head><figDesc>Copy D. Reproduced by permission of the Houghton Library, Harvard

                    eat has already been digested by William Blake and is here held up by his
                    Spectre for all to see. The tiny book of Revelation has been as it were
                    magnified into the text of Blake’s copper plate. While his Spectre grasps
                    the edge of the rock with both hands, we read its opening words, a variant, we
                    may suppose, of the text of the scroll flowing from Christ’s hand to
                    Adam’s: "Repose on me till the morning of the Grave. I am thy
                    life" (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 62:1).</p>
        <p>As we grasp Mitchell’s text in our turn, we appreciate his leaving it for
                    us to ponder further the presence of St. John. Let us turn to <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 99 (illus. 4) for a culminating yet sublimely modest
                    example, on Blake’s part. Let us consider the tiny black book in the left
                    hand of the aureoled elder, embracing his youthful friend (Jerusalem of course,
                    but symbolically all the lost and divided persons in the book) yet keeping his
                    book open with his index finger. (The book is quite visible in copies A and C
                    and posthumously printed ones, but obscured in others.) In <hi rend="i">The
                        Illuminated Blake</hi> I merely conjecture that "Tomorrow Urizen
                    (Jehovah) will resume reading the Everlasting Gospel."</p>
        <p>On Plate 99 of course we have reached "The End of The Song of
                    Jerusalem." In Chapter 10 of Revelation there is a good deal more reading
                    to be done. But a voice from heaven tells St. John to stop writing. Instead he
                    is advised to "Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the
                    angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth." "And I went
                    unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me,
                    Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in
                    thy mouth sweet as honey." And St. John tasted and ate and found that this
                    was true.<ref target="n64" type="note">6</ref> "And he said unto me, Thou
                    must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and
                    kings." In <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 62 if we see Adam/Albion in the
                    giant, we see that he is not yet risen as the sun—his rising is shown and
                    described on Plate 95—but that he is bearing the whole weight of the
                    text, like the Titan Enceladus when flattened by Mount Etna (theatrically
                    depicted in early illustrations of Ovid: see illus. 6).<ref target="n65" type="note">7</ref> Indeed, the text is bitter in his belly. Yet he is no
                    longer drowsing while Blake writes, as in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 37 [41]
                    (illus. 7) where Blake is preparing a text for Albion to read in the mirror of
                    annihilation. He is now awake, holding for us to read—we are his
                    mirror—the dialogue of Jerusalem and Jesus "among the flames of the
                    Furnaces." Dare we become what we read here, finding even the honey of
                    "hope" amid the bitterness of "a hard journey" and
                    "terrible pains" (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 62:27, 35-36, 42)? We can see
                    from Plate 100 that the prophet’s work is never done. <note id="n64"><hi rend="s">6</hi> The face of Dürer’s St. John expresses an
                        awareness of the bitter taste even as he takes his first bite of the text.
                        But Dürer’s symbolism conflates the whole process of
                        transmission; the book his St. John is writing is already filling with text.

                            gripping hands). Is the fire in the belly of the mountain in combat with
                            the relayed Jovian thunderbolts? (Compare the ambiguities of fire in
                            Blake’s "Spiritual form of Nelson.")</p><p>In this same collection, the Picart "Andromeda" seems to me

        <p>The modesty of Blake’s handling of this emblem may impress us. But Harold
                    Bloom, with whom I have just discussed the eating and digestion of the book,
                    noted that Blake’s lifelong immersion in the language of the Bible must
                    have developed as a matter of second nature his prophetic recourse to the
                    company of Isaiah and Ezekiel. Look up Ezekiel 2 and 3, he advised. "And
                    when I looked, behold, a hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was
                    therein . . . and it was written within and <figure><head>3 Page 16, <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi></head><figDesc>Reproduced by permission of the British Library.</figDesc></figure><figure><head>4 <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 99.)</head><figDesc>Copy J.

                            1733.</head></figure> without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and
                    woe. Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll,
                    and go speak unto the house of Israel. So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to
                    eat that roll. And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill
                    thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my
                    mouth as honey for sweetness." The Lord does not mention any embittering of
                    the prophet’s belly. But he expresses an irony which Blake, often bound
                    to "sullen contemplations in the night," well understood. If I had
                    "sent thee," the Lord tells Ezekiel, "to many people of a strange
                    speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand . . . they
                    would have hearkened unto thee." But his own nation, who could of course
                    understand, "will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me.
                    . . . " Nevertheless the prophet is sent; he must speak to his fellow
                    countrymen "whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear." The
                    Lord hardened Ezekiel’s "forehead against their foreheads."
                    "So the spirit lifted me up . . . and I went in bitterness, in the heat of
                    my spirit; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me." Thus Blake in his
                    youth wrote, with a "voice of honest indignation," a bible "which
                    the world shall have whether they will or no" (<hi rend="i">Marriage of
                        Heaven and Hell</hi>, 12, 24) and in times of stress was hardened to set
                    "my forehead against their foreheads" (Letter of 6 July 1803).</p>

                    digested: "Towards a Valid Theory of Biblical Hebrew Literature," by
                    Isaac Rabinowitz.<ref target="n66" type="note">8</ref> "The utterance of
                    prophetic words . . . is for the purpose of getting them into the world so that
                    they may act upon the world; as such they are conceived as transcending the
                    limits of communication, and so do not necessarily require an audience" (p.
                    324). Rabinowitz translates Isaiah 55:10-11 thus, emphasizing this aspect of the
                    meaning with shifts of tense: <q> For as the rain or the snow comes down from

                    his remarks to Crabb Robinson. Utterance was all: "the moment I have

          <p>Until recently the only full-length monograph on John Flaxman available to
                        scholars was the limited edition of W. G. Constable’s biography
                        published in 1927. However, 1979 saw Flaxman’s full re-emergence as
                        an artistic personality. The re-evaluation of his importance reached its
                        peak with the major Flaxman exhibitions held in Hamburg, Copenhagen, and
                        London accompanied by an extensive catalogue edited by David Bindman, the
                        numerous reviews of these exhibitions, and the publication of David
                        Irwin’s monograph, <hi rend="i">John Flaxman 1755-1826 Sculptor
                            Illustrator Designer.</hi> Thus, John Flaxman, whose art Irwin promoted
                        as early as 1959 (see "Reviving Interest in Flaxman," <hi rend="i">Connoisseur</hi>, 144 [1959], 104-05), is now the subject of much
                        modern attention.</p>
          <p>In the Preface of his book, the first full-scale appraisal of
                        Flaxman’s life and work, Irwin states: <q> My aim has been a
                            comprehensive examination of all aspects of Flaxman’s career
                            between the covers of one book. Different areas of his work are
                            interdependent, thus making separate studies by their very nature
                            incomplete. I have not traced his influence abroad, nor included his
                            influence on Victorian artists. I have tried, however, to discuss as
                            many of Flaxman’s works as possible, short of producing a <hi rend="i">catalogue raisonné.</hi></q></p>
          <p>Irwin has been quite successful in the task he set for himself. He has
                        assembled and collated information from widely diverse and often
                        hard-to-find sources into a logical, cogent—if at times
                        dry—exposition of Flaxman’s development. Undoubtedly, the
                        book’s greatest contribution to scholarship is its presentation of
                        factual information in an organized format.</p>
          <p>Technically the book is excellent. It is well-designed and offers 282
                        illustrations, all black-and-white (a fact which is less distressing with
                        Flaxman’s work than with that of most artists, as the majority of his
                        drawings are pen-and-ink while his sculpture is uncolored marble). The
                        illustrations are located either on or near the page of the discussion, and
                        there are notably few errors in corresponding plate numbers.</p>
          <p>The format is basically thematic, although the progression of
                        Flaxman’s interests allows the author to place the ten chapters in a
                        generally chronological sequence: (I) Early Career; (II) Artist and
                        Industry: Wedgwood; (III) To Italy; (IV) Sculptures in Italy; (V)
                        Illustrations; (VI) Sculptor of Tombs: after 1794; (VII) Sculpture: Secular
                        Commissions; (VIII) Portraits; (IX) Royal Plate and Other Metalwork; (X)
                        Professor of Sculpture; Epilogue: Victorian Taste. Notes, bibliography,
                        index of works and general index follow.</p>
          <pb id="p15-177" n="177"/>
          <p>The outstanding feature of Irwin’s study is his presentation within a
                        single volume of the entire range of Flaxman’s activities. Besides
                        lecturing at the Royal Academy, Flaxman was a prolific sculptor of tombs and
                        monuments, an influential illustrator of important literary works, and a
                        recognized designer of pottery and silver. Irwin’s greatest
                        contribution to our understanding of Flaxman’s work is his chapter on
                        Flaxman’s interest in Italian Trecento and Quattrocento art. The care
                        with which Irwin cites only those frescoes that Flaxman could have seen in
                        the 1790s is a credit to his thorough art-historical methodology. In
                        addition, he incorporates an excellent selection of photographs to
                        demonstrate the Italian sources for Flaxman’s art. The
                        author’s discussion of the close relationship between John Flaxman
                        and William Young Ottley offers valuable insights into a relationship which
                        has received too little attention. In this context, Ottley’s
                        dedication of his volume, <hi rend="i">A Series of plates engraved after the
                            paintings and sculptures of the most eminent masters of the early
                            Florentine school</hi>, 1826, to John Flaxman deserves further study.
                        Certainly Ottley’s admiration for Flaxman is evident in his drawing
                        style. Many Ottley drawings, made in preparation for the volume on
                        Florentine art and also based on Flaxman’s engraved designs to Dante,
                        Homer, and Aeschylus, are stylistically so close to Flaxman that they have
                        been incorrectly catalogued as Flaxman drawings.</p>
          <p>Despite the importance of this instructive research on Flaxman, some minor
                        criticisms are necessary. In many instances, the author seems to have
                        unnecessarily limited his aims and viewpoint. All too often he confines
                        himself to a mere recitation of events and description of works.
                        Flaxman’s interaction with other artists of the period is seldom
                        discussed, and the artistic theories prevalent at the time are not explored
                        in relationship to Flaxman. Indeed, Irwin fails to make critical judgments
                        about Flaxman’s place in the art world of 1800. One example is his
                        discussion of Flaxman’s <hi rend="i">Triumphal Arch surmounted by
                            Britannia</hi> where no mention is made of French visionary architects
                        like Boullée and Ledoux. These architects conceived projects of
                        enormous proportions that undoubtedly furnished precedents for
                        Flaxman’s design.</p>
          <p>Symptomatic of the limitations of Irwin’s methodology is the
                        comparison of Flaxman’s <hi rend="i">Achilles Shield</hi> and Thomas
                        Stothard’s <hi rend="i">Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne: Sideboard
                            Dish</hi> which appear as consecutive illustrations in Chapter X. Irwin
                        writes: <q> The Shield of Achilles was displayed prominently at the
                            coronation banquet in July 1821. The royal collection already possessed
                            a large sideboard dish illustrating the theme of the <hi rend="i">Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne</hi>, which had been designed by
                            Stothard, and also made for Rundell’s, in 1814 (Plate 271). The
                            composition of this dish and the shield are in some respects similar,
                            and it is possible that Flaxman influenced his fellow artist. The
                            similarities may however have been prescribed in the commisions [sic].
                            Both works have a central motif of a chariot flanked by several figures,
                            but whereas Flaxman’s represent constellations, Stothard’s
                            are putti; Flaxman’s chariot is pulled by horses,
                            Stothard’s by centaurs.<lb/> (pp. 194-95) </q> John
                        Flaxman’s refinement of composition, his ability to design complex
                        figural groups which remain clear and distinct, and his sensitive use of
                        three-dimensional qualities contrast sharply with Stothard’s
                        overly-elaborate compositional elements and less well-proportioned figures.
                        The author’s exposition of these important differences would
                        certainly clarify the positive aspects of Flaxman’s style and his
                        sensibility in design. <q> In Chapter IV Irwin notes that<lb/><lb/>
                            Flaxman’s volumes [of illustrations to Homer, Aeschylus and
                            Dante] were therefore published either without any quotations at all or
                            with only a minimal number of lines under each plate. This novel form of
                            publication undoubtedly contributed to their contemporary visual impact
                            and their far-reaching influence.<lb/> (pp. 68-69) </q> This "novel
                        form of publication" is significant and deserves elaboration. The
                        history of book illustration offers some prototypes for this format, such as
                        Stothard’s <hi rend="i">Pilgrim’s Progress</hi> series of
                        1788-91. A broader view of context and influence would have added to the
                        scholarly insights in this volume.</p>
          <p>Blake scholars will be disappointed by the paucity of references to the
                        object of their interest. For example, Flaxman’s drawings for the <hi rend="i">Book of Enoch</hi> (one of which appears as figure 140) display
                        many correspondences with Blake’s drawings of the same subject, while
                        the similarities between Flaxman’s drawing for William
                        Collins’ sculptural monument (figure 77) and Blake’s
                        illustrations for <hi rend="i">America</hi> will be obvious to Blake
                        scholars; Irwin’s reticence on these points is regretable. The
                        discussion of Flaxman’s designs for Homer, Aeschylus, and Dante
                        rightly stresses the importance of symmetry in these works. Flaxman’s
                        illustrations, produced in Italy during the early 1790s, rely on a
                        simplification or distillation of each form, a positioning of those forms in
                        a perpendicular or parallel relationship to each other, and a division of
                        the abstract spaceless ground into geometric segments. It is likely that
                        upon Flaxman’s return from Italy in 1794, these engravings had an
                        important stylistic impact on Blake. That the period 1794-1795 was traumatic
                        for Blake has often been noted in reference to his poetry and his political
                        beliefs. The French Revolution, the execution of Louis XVI, the Reign of
                        Terror, and the repressive measures instituted by the English government all
                        contributed to the disillusionment of Blake and other radicals of the
                        period. This disillusionment caused Blake to alter not only his political
                        and philosophical attitudes, but his poetic and artistic methods as well.
                        Flaxman’s designs are more abstract and refined than Blake’s,
                        but Blake was capable of translating the compositional elements of
                        Flaxman’s engravings into the powerful images of the 1795 series of
                        color-printed drawings. As Blake is now the most popular <pb id="p15-178" n="178"/> and well-known artist of this period, it is unfortunate that
                        such specific correlations in style, technique, and theory between the two
                        close friends are not included in Irwin’s study.</p>
          <p>The only really distressing aspect of the book is Irwin’s attitude
                        toward references. Footnotes in the volume most often cite contemporary
                        sources or the manuscripts and drawings themselves. This approach ignores
                        the more recent critical commentary on individual Flaxman works. Thus, when
                        Irwin refers to Goya’s use of Flaxman’s Dante designs, he does
                        not cite Sarah Symmons’ excellent article, "John Flaxman and
                        Francisco Goya: Infernos Transcribed" (<hi rend="i">Burlington
                            Magazine</hi>, 113 [Sept. 1971], 508-12), nor does he specifically
                        credit Robert Wark with the cogent analysis of Flaxman’s drawing
                        style in <hi rend="i">Drawings by John Flaxman in the Huntington
                            Collection</hi>, 1970. In his discussion of deathbed scenes he does not
                        refer to Robert Rosenblum’s seminal work on the topic in <hi rend="i">Transformations in Late Eighteenth Century Art</hi>, 1967, a book whose
                        footnotes have provided the stimulus for numerous dissertations.
                        Irwin’s exploration of Flaxman’s publication of Hesiod does
                        not direct the reader to G. E. Bentley, Jr., "Blake’s
                        Hesiod" (<hi rend="i">Library</hi>, 20 [1965], 315-320); and although
                        he does cite Bentley’s <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, the awkward
                        format of the footnotes requires one to go from Chapter V, footnote 30, back
                        to Chapter I, footnote 7, to discover to which work by Bentley Irwin is
                        referring.</p>
          <p>The problems in citation may appear trivial, but a volume with pretentions to
                        offering a thorough discussion, short of a <hi rend="i">catalogue
                            raisonné</hi>, of the works of a single Neoclassic artist is
                        definitely more than a coffee-table book. As such, one expects a
                        thoroughness in the footnotes that will provide valuable research
                        assistance. (It is possible that the reservations noted in this review may
                        be partly the result of the delay between completion of Irwin’s
                        manuscript and publication.) Undoubtedly, Irwin’s book will be the
                        primary Flaxman reference for many years to come. The catalogue edited by
                        David Bindman (<hi rend="i">John Flaxman, R. A.</hi>, London: Thames and
                        Hudson Ltd., 1979) will better serve scholars interested in the broader
                        questions slighted by Irwin, such as Flaxman’s place within the
                        context of his contemporary art scene and the exploration of his
                        international influence. Irwin’s book, however, has the virtue of
                        providing a comprehensive life of Flaxman with the traditional biographical
                        elements and a straightforward exposition of his major works. Taken
                        together, these two recent volumes should promote a more informed
                        appreciation of John Flaxman’s <hi rend="i">oeuvre</hi> and furnish
                        the basis for further, more detailed studies of his career and
                        influence.</p>

          <p>The novelty of what David Simpson is doing in this book about irony in
                        Romantic poetry is indicated by the fact that Byron gets only one brief
                        mention in it. Correlatively, Simpson aims to unseat established views of
                        Romantic poetry as personal expression or as poetry of experience (though
                        lines of communication are kept open with both views). Instead, the work of
                        Keats, Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley, and approximately
                        contemporary tendencies in philosophy and aesthetics (notably the work of
                        Hegel) are described as ironic, but not in a sense which most readers will
                        be familiar with. But then "defamiliarisation" is what the book is
                        all about.</p>
          <p>Most of us think of irony as, with various provisos and sophistications,
                        "saying one thing and meaning another." David Simpson is talking
                        about a more radically unsettling practice, a practice named in a German
                        theoretical tradition and invoked in some recent North American criticism
                        (notably, and relevently, by Paul de Man in "The Rhetoric of
                        Temporality"). According to the notion of irony with which most of us
                        are more familiar, the <hi rend="i">meaning</hi> of what is said, the real
                        position of its author, can be deduced <hi rend="i">from</hi> what is said.
                        The reader knows where he stands because he knows where the author stands: a
                        reciprocal identification established via the material through which they
                        communicate. Romantic irony on the other hand insistently disturbs or even
                        subverts these relationships, drawing attention to the processes of
                        identification and interpretation themselves. Language, if it can still be
                        talked about as a "medium" at all, becomes "a medium which
                        takes us by the arm and shakes us into activity, rather than one which
                        vanishes in reverence to the prior clarity of the message it embodies"
                        (p. 56). Romantic irony forces us to construct meaning for ourselves in what
                        is therefore a "performative" activity: an activity, that is to
                        say, which involves making meanings as much as responding to and describing
                        them. All such attributions of meaning, interpretations, are therefore, by
                        definition, themselves put into question. The link between the question of
                        irony and the question of authority is evident: Simpson avoids the pun on
                        authors and authority, but perhaps a reviewer may be allowed it.</p>
          <p>He quote Shelley on the primary task of philosophy: <q> Philosophy, impatient
                            as it may be to build, has much work yet remaining, as pioneer for the
                            overgrowth of ages. It makes one step towards this object; it destroys
                            error, and the roots of error. It leaves, what it is too often the duty
                            of the reformer in political and ethical questions to leave, a vacancy.
                            It reduces the mind to that freedom in which it would have acted, but
                            for the misuse of words and signs, the instruments of its own
                                creation.<ref target="n67" type="note">1</ref><note id="n67"><hi rend="s">1</hi> P. 30, quoted from <hi rend="i">The
                                    Complete Works of Shelley</hi>, ed. Ingpen and Peck, (rpt., New
                                York and London: Gordian Press and Ernest Benn Ltd., 1965), VI,
                                195.</note></q><pb id="p15-180" n="180"/> What is identified, in the poetry and the
                        philosophy, is this work of deconstruction; and reconstruction, except that
                        such reconstruction is never more than provisional, itself always subject to
                        further deconstruction. David Simpson moreover shares the principles he
                        finds at work in Romantic writing. That he does so is, as he is well aware,
                        itself unsettling. He is aware of the questioning which must attend
                        continually on his own critical discourse; aware that it cannot exclude
                        itself from the paradoxes of that "hermeneutic circle" to which it
                        refers. A book of this kind is bound to be difficult, and this is certainly
                        a difficult book. Its success needs to be judged by its ability to go on
                        thinking clearly when what has to be thought clearly is the impossibility of
                        thinking clearly, or at any rate without doubleness. By this criterion the
                        book is, most of the time, an outstanding success.</p>
          <p>The book’s descriptions of its own procedures necessarily resemble the
                        poetic procedures to which it refers. Thus "we shall find ourselves
                        constantly laying and unlaying the same bricks, in a process marked by
                        repetition rather than clearly defined progress" (p. 24). The book
                        begins with detailed readings of <hi rend="i">Ode on a Grecian Urn</hi> and
                            <hi rend="i">La Belle Dame Sans Merci.</hi> Thereafter individual
                        chapters are devoted to specific issues—the image of childhood,
                        theories and practices of language, the relation between author and
                        narrator, metaphor, irony—which are at the same time reapproaches to
                        a single chameleon problematic. Some poems are discussed, or referred to,
                        repeatedly; so one way of grasping the drift and force of the argument, in
                        the context of the present review, is to describe some of these
                        readings.</p>
          <p>In Wordsworth’s <hi rend="i">The Thorn</hi>, Simpson argues, we may
                        eventually decide that no real facts are available to us that are
                        uncontaminated by the gossip of the community in which Martha Ray lives or
                        by the "old sea captain" who is identified by Wordsworth,
                        elsewhere, as the "loquatious narrator" of the poem. Even the
                        description of the moss upon the little hill at the beginning of the poem
                            <q> As if by hand of lady fair<lb/> The work had woven been;<lb/> And
                            cups, the darlings of the eye,<lb/> So deep in their vermillion
                            dye<lb/><lb/> introduces under the cover of "observation" the
                            primary images and metaphors of the human drama to which all this is
                            supposed to be but a preface (p. 104). </q> The insidious thing about
                        such figurative language in the poem <q> is that it is just ambiguous enough
                            to make the casual reader think that he is making genuine connections
                            and finding things for himself; whereas all the time he is simply
                            falling into the trap laid by an unconsciously cunning narrator. (p.
                            105) </q> So the poem must encourage the <hi rend="i">un</hi>casual
                        reader to get "beyond, in our own voices, the sorts of misprision which
                        the old sea-captain inflicts on the landscape, and on the human beings who
                        are dragged into it." (p. 105). But this is impossible; by definition
                        since the contamination is complete and no other source of information is
                        available. A commitment to "things in themselves" is both posited
                        and put out of reach. In this respect the poem, and our experience as
                        readers of it, dramatizes what Simpson calls Wordsworth’s
                        "uncontrollable epistemological predicament." After all, <hi rend="i">The Lyrical Ballads</hi> are about situations wherein "the
                        feeling therein developed gives importance to the action and situation and
                        not the action and situation to the feeling." And this is, as Simpson
                        says, "a positive manifesto as much as a crime" (p. 107). In which
                        case the would-be open minded narrator of the poem can indeed be seen as an
                        emblem of the poet Wordsworth himself. So that poet and narrator, whom we
                        have to separate, also come together again. And Simpson connects this,
                        through a discussion of certain developments in eighteenth-century
                        philosophy, with a widespread instability in "the very vocabulary and
                        concept of distinction" (p. 122). The mind’s relation to the
                        world, to itself, and to its possible "parts" is uncontrollably
                        shifting: "Each is present, or absent, simultaneously with the
                        other" (p. 123).</p>
          <p>What happens to names, the practice of naming, is a central instance of this
                        complex instability. And some of the most interesting remarks on
                        Blake’s work appear in the context of Simpson’s discussion of
                        how, for the Romantics, the "disruption of the stability of objects and
                        names . . . unsettles the subject whose tools they are" (p. 70).
                        "Blake’s undertaking begins, notoriously, with the proper name
                        itself" (p. 76). In speculating on the etymology of "Urizen"
                        Simpson argues that the "list of homophonal substitutions which can be
                        made into this name seems almost infinite" (p. 76). His own suggested
                        substitutions are, he insists, <q> not matters for scholarly proof, perhaps,
                            and what I have suggested will no doubt be accorded various degrees of
                            probability by different readers. But this could be exactly the point.
                            In the fallen world which Urizen, and our reason, represent, dominated
                            as it is by intentional projections and inflections of the self into the
                            world (a process which Blake the artist does not consider himself immune
                            from), is not this fronting of the altering eye the most important
                            meaning of all? (p. 77) </q> Naming is also the theme of
                        Simpson’s discussion of <hi rend="i">Infant Joy.</hi> He rejects the
                        notion that the <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> poems are spoken by Innocence
                        and that we therefore need to slough off adult sophistication in order to
                        read them properly. Some, at least, can be read as spoken by dramatically
                        presented adult narrators implicitly conditioned by the properties of
                        experience. <hi rend="i">Infant Joy</hi> is a case in point. It is usually
                        read as "a celebration of maternal love, a loving dialogue between
                        adult and infant" (p. 52), and "the flower containing the group of
                        figures" in the illustration "is usually deemed to be opening,
                        with the limp flower yet to open." But Simpson points out that
                        "this latter flower could as well have gone through its cycle already,
                        and the open flower could be in the process of closing" (p. 53), a
                        reading which of course gives a very different significance <pb id="p15-181" n="181"/> to the family relationships going on in the open flower. And
                        in the poem the speaker <q> turns (that is, paraphrases the infant into
                            turning) the description of a state—"I happy
                            am"—into a proper noun—"Joy is my
                            name"—society’s gesture of appropriation and
                            admission, and, of course, of signification. (p. 53) </q> Sweet joy
                            be<hi rend="i">falls</hi> the helpless infant. But we are not offered a
                        simple reversal of the standard positive reading: <q> I do not mean to imply
                            that my reading is the authoritative one, and it is not simply modesty
                            which makes me say so. For we can pass on beyond it, to a higher level
                            of consciousness and self-consciousness. The benediction again comes to
                            seem positive, and the smile again holds a degree of promise, when we
                            recall or realise that the fall is a necessary fall, and that there is
                            no innocence except as it is discovered or constructed. (p. 54) </q> A
                        discovery and construction which applies of course both to our relationship
                        to the text and to the other kinds of relationship to which the text
                        refers.</p>
          <p>The image of the child has a crucial role to play in this reading of
                        Romanticism, as of course it has in other readings. But for Simpson it is
                        very much the <hi rend="i">image</hi> of the child which is at stake.
                        Childhood reproaches us with "the errors of acquired folly" as
                        Blake put it. And the child, who is therefore an agent of deconstruction is
                        also the Romantic ironist <hi rend="i">par excellence</hi>: he is never
                        reachable except as the receding image which the adult consciousness has of
                        him. The child disrupts institutions and personalities outside himself by
                        being conceived as their "other" but by the same token "is
                        himself denied the level of metacommentary, the stable identity which would
                        enable him to replace in any absolute way the authority which he
                        challenges" (p. 33).</p>
          <p>Clearly Simpson commits himself to the view that there was something which
                        can be called Romanticism. A commitment of this kind needs to accomplish two
                        things, I think, in particular. It needs to show that the writers so
                        designated are linked by their differences as well as by their similarities.
                        And it needs to show that what is said of them cannot really be said of
                        other writers.</p>
          <p>On the first count the book is impressively successful. At least so far as
                        the poetry is concerned; I am less competent to judge the philosophical
                        texts, though there certainly seems to be a close analogy between what the
                        poetry is doing and what the philosophical texts are saying (and sometimes
                        doing). As for the poetry it is already clear that, for instance, Blake is
                        more extreme and more self-possessed in his engagement with issues that
                        Wordsworth also addresses. Blake, that is to say, is more thoroughgoing,
                        enthusiastic, and explicit in his subversion of self-possession.</p>
          <p>The chapter on metaphor is perhaps the most difficult part of the book, and I
                        am not sure that its various elements are ever effectively coordinated.
                        Nevertheless it is in this chapter that I get the strongest sense of writers
                        who are linked by their differences. Simpson sets out to show that
                        Shelley’s commitment to metaphor as the <hi rend="i">sine qua
                            non</hi> of poetry is consistent with a deep scepticism about metaphor
                        on the part of Wordsworth, Coleridge and Blake. The figurative language of
                        the old sea-captain is evidence of the dangers involved in metaphor for
                        Wordsworth. We may be deceived into believing that relationships made by the
                        mind and through language are already present in the real world as facts
                        which the mind and language then respond to. In other words a danger of
                        reification is built into metaphor, "both of [consciousness] and of the
                        elements of its world, reciprocally" (p. 160). We are tempted to deny
                        the performative character of our activities as minds in relation to the
                        world, as authors or readers in relation to texts.</p>
          <p>The hostility to metaphor is most explicit in Coleridge’s criticism
                        and theory, as part of his campaign against our tendency to be convinced by
                        "impressive images in juxtaposition." Wordsworth’s
                        ambivalence on this issue will already be evident from the ambivalent
                        relationship between "author" and "narrator" of <hi rend="i">The Thorn.</hi> Blake prefers analogy to metaphor because it
                        brings out, what metaphor tends to conceal, the <hi rend="i">activity</hi>
                        of making connections. And Simpson suggests that for Blake the uncreative
                        activity of creation (as it is evoked for instance in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> when "Thought changed the infinite to a serpent")
                        is "exactly the metaphorical process, which shuts up the infinite
                        revolutions" (p. 159). In a similar way one could say that the passage
                        from joy to Joy in <hi rend="i">Infant Joy</hi> imposes on the child a name
                        that is then said to be proper to it.</p>
          <p>The central place given to metaphor in poetic creation by Shelley is a
                        different response to the same kind of insight. "The reification
                        through metaphor which Wordsworth fears so much is countered by Shelley with
                        an oversupply of metaphor which prevents us ever coming to a <hi rend="i">stop</hi> in the production of meanings" (p. 161).
                        Shelley’s metaphors tend to "interfere" with one another;
                        "each single relation develops out of and turns into another." And
                        correlatively "the subject which is accustomed to the
                        ‘outering’ gesture as a means of establishing its identity
                        will also be in a state of becoming, the ethical corollary of which is love,
                        where all things ‘meet and mingle’" (p. 163). As Shelley
                        said, "Veil after veil may be withdrawn, and the inmost naked beauty of
                        the meaning never exposed."<ref target="n68" type="note">2</ref><note id="n68"><hi rend="s">2</hi> P. 163, quoting <hi rend="i">The Complete

          <p>In its attempt to show that things are true of these writers which are not
                        really true of previous writers the book is I think less successful. In
                        effect Simpson presents a kind of "modernization theory" which
                        claims that there is a direct link between the spirit of our age and the
                        spirit of the Romantic age and a pretty clear historical break between
                        Augustan and Romantic discourse. <q> Augustan discourse was usually content
                            to insinuate the unquestioned verification of the perceiving subject by
                            never describing it, never suggesting that it might be responsible for
                            what it sees. It exists as an unspoken <pb id="p15-182" n="182"/> but
                            implicitly central presence from which, and not through which, the
                            landscape is organised, and the precision-crafted gallery of general
                            specificities, visual and psychological, which it conveys, are deployed
                            through the rhymed couplet. Romanticism, on the other hand, seems
                            fundamentally committed to a model of ‘reciprocal
                            causality’, wherein the self and object are articulated
                            coinstantaneously, and poetic description, with its implication in and
                            dramatisation of temporality, must then tend to provide an unsettled
                            rhetoric out of which this synthetic moment emerges
                            ‘negatively’, if at all, from a context of surrounding
                            qualifications and blunted approaches. (pp. 138-39) </q> This is a
                        helpful formulation. And it is unfair to criticize a book about one mode of
                        discourse for not offering equally nuanced and complex analysis of other
                        modes with which it is contrasted. But there is a particular problem when
                        the modes of discourse involved are the Augustan and the Romantic. There is
                        frequently in such cases, as I think there is here, a suspiciously perfect
                        co-incidence between the description and what is described: we have a
                        composed and generalized description of a composed and generalizing
                        discourse and a complex, paradoxical, and very detailed description of a
                        complex and paradoxical discourse. David Simpson is acutely conscious of the
                        paradox involved, from a hermeneutic perspective, in offering to establish
                        an historical origin for that perspective; acutely conscious of the
                        probability of finding just what he is looking for. But this
                        self-consciousness would be more convincing if some attempt had been made to
                        analyze a few non-Romantic literary texts with the kind of concentration and
                        deconstructive intent he brings so effectively to Romantic ones. He does
                        comment on a few lines of Cowper and Crabbe; but since I disagree with what
                        he says about the lines of Crabbe, I don’t know whether this just
                        means that Crabbe has been put on the wrong side of the line or that the
                        line doesn’t really exist in the way Simpson suggests. I suspect that
                        the most resolutely composed Augustan poems can (and should) be discomposed.
                        They can be read as ironic in the Simpson sense, even if secretly or
                        reluctantly so. But this does not simply mean that the Augustan/Romantic
                        distinction should be drawn less sharply. It needs somehow to be
                        redrawn.</p>
          <p>There could be no better indication of the distinction between the two
                        concepts of irony than the distinction between <hi rend="i">A Tale of a
                            Tub</hi> and Leavis’ notable essay <hi rend="i">The Irony of
                            Swift.</hi> Leavis’ blindness, in my view, to an important
                        dimension of Swift’s practice coincides precisely with his use of the
                        familiar notion of irony and the kind of meaning which it requires of a
                        text. Now I don’t simply want to set up Swift as disproof of what
                        Simpson says about Augustan discourse; he says, after all, that it was
                        "usually" as he describes it. The problem is rather that Swift
                        remains, despite his "romantic" irony quite definitely <hi rend="i">not</hi> a Romantic writer. And I can’t at the moment
                        see how, with David Simpson’s terms, that relationship of difference
                        and similarity is to be described. (A difference and similarity written into
                        the curious conclusion of Leavis’ own essay: "We shall not think
                        Swift remarkable for intelligence if we think of Blake.")</p>
          <p>David Simpson’s historical placing of the Romantic poets raises
                        another problem, though in this case one that he is certainly aware of. In
                        all this talk about "the reader" for instance <q> How . . . is the
                            reader of 1798 to be distinguished from the reader of 1978? The answer
                            is another question: ‘which reader of 1798, and for which reader
                            of 1978?’ (p. xi) </q> Simpson quite fairly leaves that question
                        to us. And this reader is immediately reminded of Wordsworth in <hi rend="i">Simon Lee</hi> addressing <q> My gentle reader, I perceive<lb/> How
                            patiently you’ve waited,<lb/> And I’m afraid that you
                            expect<lb/> Some tale will be related. </q> Wordsworth, a gentleman
                        writing about "an old huntsman," draws the attention of his
                        readers of 1798 to their status as, in all probability, gentlefolk; and to
                        the doubtful moral claims which that title silently endows them with in its
                        association of gentility with gentleness. Now this is an unsettling of
                        relationships which suggests that Wordsworth is very well aware of the
                        historical context of the crisis of intersubjective verification as Kelvin
                        Everest has described it in <hi rend="i">Coleridge’s Secret
                            Ministry.</hi> It is instructive to read Simpson in conjunction with
                        Everest, who describes "a shift in the poet’s sense of audience,
                        his sense of the authority which his values carry"<ref target="n69" type="note">3</ref> but who sees it in the context of a general
                        "cultural dislocation that took place in England in the 1790s, a
                        dislocation that issued not only in the clearer manifestation of class
                        conflicts developing with the industrial revolution, but in the separation
                        of the creative intellect from its accustomed audience."<ref target="n70" type="note">4</ref> So that the poets are "isolated by
                        class from the common people, and by principle from their social and
                        intellectual fellows."<ref target="n71" type="note">5</ref><note id="n69"><hi rend="s">3</hi> Kelvin Everest, <hi rend="i">Coleridge’s Secret Ministry, the Context of the Conversation

          <p>This cultural disclocation may be defined as a disclocation, across the whole
                        range of social life, in the processes of signification. The processes
                        through which identities are constructed became increasingly visible and
                        problematic, and this may of course be cause for both hope and fear. Thus
                        many of the poems with which Simpson deals bear directly upon other
                        discursive activities which are themselves in effect
                        "performative": a child is christened in <hi rend="i">Infant
                            Joy</hi>, Martha Ray is gossipped into isolation in <hi rend="i">The
                            Thorn.</hi> Tom Paine identifies the reifying tendency of metaphor in a
                        way that closely parallels the positions of Wordsworth and Blake. He
                        identifies Burke’s metaphorical language as an integral part of the

          <p>If the processes of human identification were peculiarly visible and
                        problematic, the task—then or now—of deciding what was <hi rend="i">really</hi> going on must be a peculiarly difficult one, must
                        involve from the start questions of metaphor, of narrative, of
                        characterization. The question of whether there was really a promise/threat
                        of Revolution in England is in <hi rend="i">some</hi> respects like the
                        question of what really happened to Martha Ray.</p>
          <p>David Simpson’s reading of Romantic poetry leads out naturally and
                        fruitfully, in my view, into these wider contexts. On the other hand the way
                        in which he himself refers to the social and political context might
                        discourage some readers from going in that direction. For instance: <q> . .
                            . I have not given carefully constructed accounts of the reaction to the
                            French Revolution, or a properly documented consideration of the reviews
                            and the reviewers. Let me stress that I do not think these things
                            unimportant; it is simply that one can only write one book at a time. It
                            may well be for example, that the rather esoteric explorations of
                            self-focussing revolutions which these writers offer have much to do
                            with the repressive legislation and draconian censorship introduced
                            during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. The ethical reservations
                            which they project about their own tendencies towards authority,
                            combined with the high sense of urgency about passing on these
                            reservations, may after all be part of a sophisticated self-protection,
                            producing a version of "revolution" which is permissible
                            precisely because personal, because unorganised in the social sense.
                            (pp. xi-xii) </q> This is a very interesting speculation, which needs to
                        be followed up. And it is certainly true that, for instance, Paine’s
                        critique of metaphor is not insistently self-reflexive; it is linked to a
                        confident commitment to the notion of a literal language of communication
                        and the authority of his own statement. But the way in which Simpson
                        formulates his speculations is open to criticism. His book talks a lot about
                            <hi rend="i">The Prelude</hi> but, as he admits, doesn’t talk
                        about the French Revolution. And this does seem to involve an assumption
                        that the French Revolution doesn’t exist in the poem in quite the
                        same way as, for instance, Mont Blanc does; that "the reaction to the
                        French Revolution" is different in kind, less "personal,"
                        than the reaction to Mont Blanc. Therefore, in so far as "self,"
                        in the phrase "self-focussing revolutions," refers to the self of
                        the person as well as the self of the revolutions I think that
                        Simpson’s distinction between personal and social revolutions is
                        misconceived. The speculative distinction David Simpson draws between
                        Revolution and revolution is subtly prescribed in the circle which his own
                        discourse draws around the practice of writing and reading poetry.</p>
          <p>It is important to make these criticisms because of the use to which this
                        book could be put, particularly in the current climate of criticism and
                        theory in North America which seems inhospitable to questions of social and
                        political context. That David Simpson’s own readings are not closed
                        in that respect is evident from his recent study of <hi rend="i">The
                            Ecchoing Green</hi> in this journal. And his book does at least address
                        itself, as we have seen, to a question that needs to be put to any
                        deconstruction criticism: just how figurative is its own vocabulary of
                        anti-authoritarian subversion? It must also be said, to sceptical <hi rend="i">British</hi> readers, that Simpson’s book is a splendid
                        vindication of theoretically informed and explicit textual analysis.</p>

          <p>One of the striking ironies of Blake scholarship over the last ten or fifteen
                        years is that so much of it unwittingly contradicts by the example of its
                        own style and method just the values in Blake’s vision it claims to
                        honor and expound. Perhaps this is a paradox that cannot be solved, however,
                        since clearly there is something in the very nature of the Blakean
                        enterprise that stubbornly mocks all efforts to write plainly about it,
                        something which seems equally to invite and to resist the sort of rational
                        discourse demanded of critical commentary.</p>
          <p>All of us have felt the dilemma. All of us have noted that the moment we try
                        to pin down our responses to the dynamics of Blake’s art, we find
                        ourselves falling into one of the postures of limited vision the work we are
                        looking at itself satirizes. No matter what tack we take—whether we
                        opt for interpretation or descriptive analysis, deconstruction or literary
                        historicism, cool objectivity or impressionistic enthusiasm—the
                        critic in us risks becoming a parody of the flexible pilgrim-reader Blake
                        ultimately addresses.</p>
          <p>No doubt this is all to the good and should be considered a necessary step in
                        the rite of reading orchestrated by Blake. For both the challenge and the
                        impossibility of finding an unearthly, Archimedian leverage point from which
                        to move the Blakean world is of course testimony to the remarkably vital
                        inclusiveness of this artist’s greater aesthetic. Still, it is useful
                        to recognize and beware the fact that like a warring Zoa, a "mistaken
                        Demon of heaven," each of our critical approaches tends to create a
                        fixed and one-sided universe out of the Blakean material, thereby
                        distorting—often obliterating—the truly transformative
                        dimensions that characterize Blake’s best work.</p>
          <p>In the text accompanying the beautiful reproductions that make up the core of
                            <hi rend="i">William Blake: The Seer and his Visions</hi>, Milton
                        Klonsky tries bravely though unsuccessfully to avoid these common pitfalls
                        of the critical act. His strategy is to take many contradictory stances,
                        settling for no one coherent approach as he shifts uneasily among three of
                        the more extreme styles of Blake commentary: personal effusion, pedantic
                        source analysis, and the mechanical cross-referencing of familiar Blakean
                        motifs. He begins his twenty-four page introduction with a gentle poke at
                        the insular reader who has neither particularized nor personalized the
                        message of perceptual renovation that Blake’s texts carry. This
                        well-taken caveat, however, turns out to serve not as a way into Blake but
                        as a prelude to a trite and tedious account of Klonsky’s own
                        visionary experience while on a one-time LSD trip in the 1960s. Throughout
                        the description of his psychedelic conversion, itself sounding like an
                        unconscious parody of the fall of Tharmas, Klonsky loosely appropriates
                        mottos from <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>,
                        "Auguries of Innocence," and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> to
                        substantiate his <pb id="p15-185" n="185"/> touching and naive claim that he
                        has responded to Blake with an affinity of feeling Blake himself would have
                        approved of. And it is true that Klonsky does come to the artist’s
                        work in a spirit of congeniality, eager to "Enter into"
                        Blake’s symbols and to "make a Friend &amp; Companion" of
                        those "Images of wonder" as Blake recommends.<ref target="n75" type="note">1</ref> However, like many others affected by the drug
                        culture who have flocked to Blake because of a vague spiritual longing and a
                        taste for hallucinogenic imagery, Klonsky too often ignores the harder part
                        of Blake’s advice to the spectator, that we should approach visionary
                        forms not just imagistically and emotionally but also "on the Fiery
                        Chariot of . . . Contemplative Thought" (<hi rend="i">VLJ</hi>, E 550).
                            <note id="n75"><hi rend="s">1</hi> "A Vision of the Last
                            Judgment," <hi rend="i">The Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>,
                            ed. David V. Erdman (New York, 1970), p. 550.</note></p>
          <p>The key word here is "contemplative." For although Klonsky’s
                        text is full of little bypaths into arcane fields of thought, none of these
                        rarefied excurses is sufficiently grounded, contemplated or developed in its
                        own right, and few are demonstrably related to the Blakean themes, purposes,
                        instances they are supposed to illuminate. Instead the author presents a
                        patchwork of allusive lore and occult references from sources outside Blake,
                        while the thread of argument that would tie all these bits of learning
                        together is most often either frayed or forgotten.</p>
          <p>An example is Klonsky’s skewed and summary disquisition on the
                        esoteric system of the Hebrew <hi rend="i">Zohar</hi>, especially its
                        mystical teaching about the seventy "facets" and the six hundred
                        thousand "entrances" of the words of scripture. Here he justifies
                        a paragraph-long aside on Cabbalistic numerology by declaring (without any
                        proven or even claimed basis in fact) that Blake was acquainted
                        "perhaps at first hand" with that "most famous version of the
                        Cabbala." He then hints in a round-about way that there is a causal
                        link between the Zoharian symbolism and Blake’s view of significant
                        form—an intriguing notion were it to be either elaborated or
                        substantiated. The entire burden of proof for such a link, however, is made
                        to rest on the shaky ground of a single quotation from <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> describing the many angles of the grain of sand hidden
                        from Satan’s watchfiends. Evidently these angles, each a "lovely
                        heaven" in Blake’s words, are to be seen by us as equivalent to
                        the seventy facets of the holy words of scripture. Yet how so, and if so to
                        what end, is unfortunately not explained. Nevertheless we might accept the
                        analogy of Cabbalistic "facets" to Blakean "angles" if
                        the comparison were offered as a merely curious parallel. But Klonsky, by
                        innuendo and—as is his wont—equivocal phrasing, implies much
                        more. He implies that Blake both intended the reference and expected it to
                        be taken as a criticism of the Jewish source, for Klonsky writes that
                        "in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> the Cabbalistic vision of the
                        multiplicity of possible entrances into the infinite was refracted by Blake
                        and revealed in its ‘minute particularity.’"</p>
          <p>Here many readers of his book may pause to note that "refracting the
                        infinite" through clear exposition of "minute particularity"
                        is certainly not one of Klonsky’s own strong points. Indeed by mixing
                        and matching ideas lifted out of context, Klonsky regularly tries to force
                        untenable connections as he juggles the niceties of both metaphor and fact.
                        His habit is either to cloud the issue by providing an excess of information
                        so that his frequently dubious tenets are virtually lost in a sea of
                        incongruous data, or, when he does hit on a fruitful analogy (for instance
                        the comparison between Blake’s fourfold system of vision and the
                        traditional fourfold method of biblical interpretation), he makes the
                        opposite error, generalizing without supplying the descriptive detail or
                        conceptual framework that would lend his notion substance, validity,
                        credence.</p>
          <p>But it is not only the content of Klonsky’s prose that is affected by
                        this disquieting carelessness and lack of critical proportion. The style,
                        too, often suffers from such idiosyncrasies as a self-indulgent penchant for
                        punning and a cuteness of diction which almost always threatens clarity. For
                        example, when Klonsky speaks of one of Blake’s witty rejoinders to
                        Crabb Robinson, he calls it "a neat thrust, most likely inspired by
                        some spirit on the spot—jabbing this pointed detail like a bare
                        bodkin into his solidly planted and down-to-earth metaphysical
                        fundament." Another time Klonsky designates what he asserts is a
                        personfication of an already hypostatized idea, "a hypertrophe of a
                        trope as ‘twere." And his trick of playing on words by
                        fragmenting them syllabically ("with-in,"
                        "immediatively," "into-it-tively," "ir-and/or
                        suprarational") only adds to the rather jarring, schizophrenic effect
                        of the tone he adopts throughout.</p>
          <p>What is at stake here, though, is not just a matter of voice. Fundamentally,
                        Klonsky’s commentary gets into trouble because it is the product of a
                        sorely divided outlook, a conflicted allegiance that gratuitously pits
                        intellect against vision and vision against intellect in an unconscious and
                        often underhanded manner destined to misrepresent Blake’s own
                        strongly integrated aesthetic. First of all, by misappropriating
                        Blake’s anti-rationalism and regarding it as a license for him to
                        eschew the precision of both analytical thought and truth to factual detail,
                        Klonsky commits a shocking array of reportorial sins hard to pass over or
                        forgive in the aggregate. For from the smallest inaccuracies of scholarship
                        and editing (such as crediting Marianne Moore rather than Yeats with the
                        invention of the phrase "literalist of the imagination" as applied
                        to Blake, or giving Morton D. Paley a new middle initial) to the more
                        egregious errors of analysis that plague Klonsky’s explications of
                        Blake’s key views on cause and effect, on the relationship between
                        artistic execution and imagination, and on the nature of spiritual
                        sensation, this author erects a sort of "allegorical abode where
                        existence hath never come" (<hi rend="i">Europe</hi> 6.7) and calls it
                        Blake’s world. One of Klonsky’s favorite devices for leaping
                        over the evidences of historical research and passing off private surmise as
                        probable fact is his liberal use of phrases like "Blake <hi rend="i">must have</hi> known . . . " or "he was <hi rend="i">undoubtedly</hi> familiar with . . . " (italics mine). The
                        "must have" construction is the most prevalent: I counted twelve
                        uses of it in the introductory essay alone, five of which are the means of
                        conveying false information, while the rest are simply minor fudgings that
                        only slightly mislead.</p>
          <pb id="p15-186" n="186"/>
          <p>But while Klonsky is impatient of both scholarly tact and intellectual rigor
                        in this way, his mistrust of the restraints of academic argument does not
                        represent a considered position. Indeed, he seems just as uncomfortable with
                        the compensatory virtues of his "amateur enthusiasm,"<ref target="n76" type="note">2</ref> and we therefore often find him
                        curiously witholding the sympathy we might well expect him to show for modes
                        of imagining that dispense with logical structures. He regularly adopts an
                        excessively cynical tone, for example, when speaking of Blake’s view
                        of the spirit world, as if embarrassed by the products of Blake’s
                        eidetic imagination even though in theory he hotly defends the psychological
                        and perceptual processes such envisionings entail. So of Blake’s
                        encounter with psychic images Klonsky says, "he also—or so he
                        claimed—saw visions and spoke face to face with spooks . . . and what
                        can we make of <hi rend="i">that</hi>?" Further on he remarks, archly,
                        that "whatever else [Blake’s] spirits had going for them, they
                        weren’t very good at business." And later still, when Klonsky is
                        ostensibly clearing Blake (yet again) of the old charge of insanity, he
                        writes: "No doubt, among the heterogeneous swarms of spirits attending
                        him he must have had (and who hasn’t?) one or two or several spirits,
                        with a bit too much white around the eyeball . . . ." In a similar
                        fashion Klonsky several times attributes to the subtly controlled, allusive
                        method of Blake’s expressive technique a wild and woolly mentality
                        more accurately descriptive of Klonsky’s own thought process. Thus
                        while analyzing what he evidently believes is the chaotic formal principle
                        of <hi rend="i">A Descriptive Catalogue</hi>, Klonsky declares that: <q> One
                            idea in <hi rend="i">A Descriptive Catalogue</hi> suggests another,
                            sometimes only distantly or even metaphorically related, which
                            immediately raises its voice above it, and then, in turn, may be drowned
                            out by a following idea, before the first can be heard again. Written in
                            the ejaculatory style of his marginalia, but now across the whole page
                            of everything he believes and knows, it is as though the conclamant and
                            sometimes discordant voices of all his attendant spirits were
                            alternately haranguing, explaining, protesting, denouncing, scolding,
                            cajoling, lecturing, pleading and prophesying. </q><note id="n76"><hi rend="s">2</hi> Cf. John Hollander, "Talkies,"

          <p>Unhappily many of the problems of the introduction are carried through in the
                        explanations of the splendid visuals which are the main allure of this book.
                        One wants to cry out, after the essay so titled by John E. Grant, "you
                        can’t write about Blake’s pictures like that!"<ref target="n77" type="note">3</ref> You cannot, that is, say that the six
                        birds painted in the sky of the title page of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of
                            Heaven and Hell</hi> are five in number simply because you want to
                        identify them with the five senses, nor can you name one of those six birds
                        an "eagle," when it is really a bird of paradise, just to be able
                        to compare it to that other eagle Blake calls "a portion of
                        genius" in one of the proverbs of Hell. Or again, in Blake’s
                        tempera "Satan Smiting Job with Sore Boils" you cannot claim that
                        the three darts in the hand of Satan are actually four darts, and you cannot
                        call the substance Satan is emptying out of the vial in that same picture
                        "venereal disease" because you want to interpret Job’s
                        affliction as sexual. <note id="n77"><hi rend="s">3</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Studies</hi>, 1 (Spring 1969), 193-205.</note></p>
          <p>But these and other difficulties that crop up in the descriptive commentary
                        do not seriously detract from the special value of the book’s 107
                        pages of illustrations. Considered as an anthology of Blake’s
                        pictorial art, the 135 separate pictures exhibited here show a satisfying
                        range of methods, kinds and iconographic concerns, and they are displayed in
                        clear, large-format reproductions, 43 of which are printed in (mostly very
                        good) color. Some of these offerings are familiar favorites, others make
                        available for the first time in an inexpensive edition glossy colored
                        versions of such striking watercolors as "The Arlington Court
                        Picture," "The Ghost of Samuel Appearing to Saul," two of the
                        full-page illustrations for the illuminated <hi rend="i">Song of Los</hi>, a
                        pair of lesser known designs from the "L’Allegro" sequence
                        and three well chosen drawings from the second set of Blake’s
                        "Comus" illustrations.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the best feature of the collection, however, is not the range of
                        pictures but the aesthetically pleasing, gently instructive way designs are
                        juxtaposed on the page to make valuable graphic points about the
                        relationship of significant themes and pictorial ideas in Blake’s
                        work. One case in point is the two page spread, pages 72-73, which pairs
                        "The Woman Taken in Adultery" with "The Blasphemer"
                        (commonly called "The Stoning of Achan"). Both paintings
                        illustrate scriptural passages that treat the motif of punishment for sin by
                        stoning, the "Woman Taken in Adultery" representing
                        Christ’s New Testament critique, in John 8, of the Old Testament law
                        which is being shown at work on the opposite page in the painting of
                        "The Blasphemer" from Leviticus 24. Another case: on the
                        page-spread just preceding, two more of Blake’s biblical
                        illustrations, "Bathsheba" and "Lot and His Daughters,"
                        are matched, but this time the connection between them remains primarily
                        compositional. The representation of Bathsheba shows her upright in the
                        center of the canvas, her arms around two young children who stand on either
                        side of her as she is being observed by David, while the design of "Lot
                        and His Daughters" depicts a drunken, half-reclining Lot flanked by <hi rend="i">his</hi> two children as they prepare to seduce him. The
                        general plot of illicit eroticism ties the two subjects together, but it is
                        the similarity of the compositions that draws our attention to the vaguely
                        cognate themes.</p>
          <p>A final example, more subtle yet possibly even more effective, is the
                        antiphonal facing of a <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> engraving on page 96
                        with Blake’s design for the titlepage of Blair’s <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> on page 97. Here the two prints maintain a symmetrical,
                        formal balance largely on the grounds of their topological identity. For
                        both designs feature two figures about to join each other on the vertical
                        axis in an ascending-descending relationship, and both sets of figures are
                        placed on the outer edges of their plates (one on the left, the other on the
                        right) with a middle space reserved for text. We note the visual mirroring,
                        and only secondarily does it occur to us that the <hi rend="i">subjects</hi>, also, are related reflexively. For the <hi rend="i">Night
                            Thoughts</hi> illustration depicts a young nude woman personifying
                        "sense" (in accord with the appropriate lines of Young’s
                        poem) who runs "savagely" to celebrate the powers remaining <pb id="p15-187" n="187"/> to her in the fading daylight while the ghastly
                        figure of descending night is about to smother her with his bell-shaped
                        pall; and the contrary situation is portrayed in the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>
                        design where a beautiful nude man, an angelic messenger, dives downward,
                        blowing his bell-shaped trumpet, to waken the shrouded, ghoulish skeleton
                        below and rouse him from the sleep of corporeal death in the grave. The
                        pictures thus comment upon each other like type and antitype. Thanks to the
                        inventiveness of Gene Conner and Murray Schwartz, layout and production
                        editors, this kind of interplay is a general feature of <hi rend="i">William
                            Blake: The Seer and his Visions</hi>, a feature the thoughtful reader
                        cannot help but learn from and enjoy.</p>
          <p>Because of such felicities, this handsomely produced book is a valuable
                        volume indeed. It will be accessible to many because of its reasonable
                        price, and so long as its owner or borrower reads the pictures and skims the
                        text, rather than vice versa, it will make an excellent introduction to
                        Blake’s art.</p>

          <p>Kathleen Raine’s line on Blake is familiar to us: He was an adept of
                        the "Perennial Philosophy," which holds that consciousness is the
                        ground of reality. In this monograph she asserts that Yeats is
                        Blake’s "greatest disciple" and "the claims he made,
                        the beliefs he held on the reversal of premises which would characterize the
                        New Age, are the same as Blake’s." When I hear this sort of
                        remark I must confess that I am inclined to stop reading; I want immediately
                        to make a list of all the important differences that I am convinced are
                        going to be glossed over in the discourse that follows. But the writer is
                        Kathleen Raine, and like many earlier quirky scholars of Blake, she is
                        usually informative even when she mounts into her particular pulpit and
                        tells us (in the tone I imagine a True Pythoness would use) that we must all
                        now hear occult Truth. This is a Truth that links the speaker in a chain of
                        adepts back to Plato, who of course was himself a neoplatonist.</p>
          <pb id="p15-188" n="188"/>
          <p>Raine declares Swedenborg to be a major influence on both Blake and Yeats.
                        This is not news. It would be if Raine were to declare that Blake does not
                        attack Swedenborg. She doesn’t, but she also fails to mention that he
                        does and that he tends to use Swedenborg very eccentrically indeed. Raine
                        declares Blake to be a diagrammatist like Yeats and all the diagrams of both
                        to be Jungian mandalas. S. Foster Damon’s diagram of Blake’s
                        city of Jerusalem is presented, along with Blake’s <hi rend="i">Vision of the Last Judgment</hi> and the famous plate 36 of <hi rend="i">Milton.</hi> But it is <hi rend="i">not</hi> said that Damon
                        might better <hi rend="i">not</hi> have diagrammed Jerusalem, which as far
                        as I can see is constructed to be a trap for diagrammatists, as is just
                        about all of <hi rend="i">A Vision.</hi> Plate 36 stands out as the <hi rend="i">only</hi> diagram Blake included in all of his illuminated
                        works and surviving manuscripts. Of course, if one equates every mandala
                        discovered in Blake with a diagram, one finds diagrams everywhere, as does
                        Raine when she declares <hi rend="i">A Vision of the Last Judgment</hi> a
                        mandala and claims Blake to have described many mandalas. The nice thing
                        about mandalas is that they are ubiquitous, once one learns alertness.</p>
          <p>The title of this monograph can be taken literally. Raine spends some time on
                        its "to" (the space between Blake and <hi rend="i">A Vision</hi>),
                        which turns out to be the Ellis-Yeats <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> of 1893. In
                        the vast commentary in that work Yeats (and Ellis) introduced occultism into
                        the interpretation of Blake and made for the most part a tasteless mess of
                        it to go along with their butchering of Blake’s text. This occultism
                        has been inconvenient for most of us, but not for Raine. It is certainly the
                        occultist aspect of Yeats’s interpretation that is constantly getting
                        him into trouble. For example, Yeats "relates Blake’s quaternity
                        to the four ‘worlds’ of the Cabala and other systems" (p.
                        16). This is typical of where Raine thinks Yeats goes right, but I believe
                        him to be going rather consistently wrong here. Raine can accept much of
                        Yeats’s reading of Blake because her own interpretive level is so
                        lofty and abstract that she rarely feels she must stoop to details of the
                        text and never to questions of tone. Basically, however, the problem is that
                        not enough attention is paid to the way in which the whole of any of
                        Blake’s works controls how much we should read into any given part.
                        Unfortunately, at Raine’s level the "wisdom" of Swedenborg,
                        Blake, Yeats, and Jung is all one. These four are "among those who have
                        . . . attempted what must, sooner or later, be attempted if indeed a
                        ‘New Age’ and a change of the premises of our culture is
                        approaching."</p>
          <p>There are too many unsupported dogmatisms in this monograph. Many years ago I
                        wrote what I think was the first serious American essay on Raine’s
                        poetry. It was a quite favorable account (I do not regret it), and I treated
                        her poetic voices as those of enchantress and medium. But neither of these
                        voices is the proper one for criticism. Luckily one can take my complaint,
                        put it to the side, and profit from parts of this text, for there are some
                        good things here though they are presented in a rather disorganized way.
                        Raine sees certain important shifts of emphasis from Blake to Yeats and
                        notices certain of Yeats’s misreadings. But must Blake’s
                        twenty-seven churches (correctly traced back to Swedenborg) be so simply
                        related to Yeats’s twenty-eight lunar phases, without so much as a
                        word that twenty-seven is not twenty-eight? Is Yeats’s little
                        dialogue in <hi rend="i">Vacillation</hi> really a dialogue with his master
                        Blake? Isn’t there, though not a "rotation" of Urizen and
                        Luvah, at least a cyclicity? Yeats got this all wrong because of his
                        astrologizing of Blake. Is Yeats’s mask really to be identified with
                        Tharmas quite so easily, as Raine does? Is there no time in Blake’s
                        eternity, or is eternity in Blake’s time? Or is it better to look
                        rather more closely and consider that there may be more than one time in
                        Blake? The most interesting part of the monograph is toward the end where
                        Raine discusses the influence of "The Mental Traveller" on <hi rend="i">A Vision</hi> and various poems. Here, however, not as much as
                        she implies is new. She calls Blake’s poem a detailed examination of
                        his symbol of Canaan. That seems promising, but she goes on to utter over
                        several pages the following equation: Canaan = Mundane Shell or Egg = the
                        world of biblical history = space and time = the twenty-seven churches = the
                        covering cherub = the womb = the serpent = the center = the mills = the
                        wheels = dens = Newton’s universe = Milton’s chaos and ancient
                        night = Dante’s Purgatory = "under the hill." This is, of
                        course, roughly so in the way Joyce later also made everybody everybody
                        else. But since all of these things are roughly the fallen world, the
                        revelation that the poem is about Canaan tells us nothing that hasn’t
                        been well known to readers of the poem for a long time under some other term
                        in the equation.</p>
          <p>Incidentally, in the process of observing Blake’s metaphorical chain,
                        Raine calls Satan the "lost traveller" of one of Blake’s
                        late short poems. But if we look at the syntax we discover that Satan is not
                        the traveller but "the lost traveller’s dream under the
                        hill." Of course, where everybody is everybody else, this ultimately
                        makes no difference. Or does it? The whole basis of Blake’s thought
                        turns on the principle of identity and the paradox in that word. Fully read,
                        it indicates that everything has an identity of its own, but is identical to
                        other things as well. Raine’s occultism negates the first meaning and
                        presses for the second. This is the point at issue here. Was Blake an
                        occultist who would suppress individual identity or the "minute
                        particular," which Raine seems to confuse with the conscious ego, or is
                        he a visionary poet who insists on both sides of the paradox at once? For
                        that matter, in the end which was Yeats?</p>
          <p>The monograph has numerous illustrations from occult texts, Blake, and <hi rend="i">A Vision.</hi> Some are not discussed. That’s all right.
                        Most of them are mandalas.</p>

          <p>It is still so easy, despite the efforts not only of historians but also of
                        literary critics, David Erdman and other Blake scholars in their forefront,
                        to forget the point which Betty Bennett usefully underlines in her
                        introduction to this collection: that for most British people, the major
                        constituent of experience in the years between 1793 and 1815 was war. In
                        fact, such is the regularity with which the Revolutionary and Napoleonic
                        Wars are treated as experiences peripheral to British culture that behind
                        this blurring of memory there begins to loom the shadow of a more deliberate
                        evasion, and an evasion of greater dimensions than those characteristic of a
                        national criticism which has traditionally preferred its historical context
                        to be presented severely diluted and preferably bent into the service of
                        moral instruction. The reasons for this evasion are complex, and some of
                        them bear a particular relation to the present: this is not an economic or
                        political phase in which inter-European warfare presents itself as a
                        privileged object of attention, nor is it one, indeed, in which military
                        history as such can be happily seen as free from political partiality. But
                        most of the reasons have a longer socio-psychological pedigree than that,
                        and the materials presented in this collection of war poetry can help us
                        towards an understanding of them; it can also help us towards a deepened
                        understanding of Blake’s literary practice by providing a
                        constellation of popular writing within which to situate his acts of
                        mysterious demystification.</p>
          <p>In referring to the experience of war, I do not mean merely to effect a
                        simple contentual connection. War, certainly, produces its own hierarchies
                        of signification, and it is the wars of the romantic age which provide, for
                        instance, a shape for those connections between aggression and commerce
                        which Blake makes so powerfully, and which, as this collection among others
                        reveals, were a habitual feature of the popular discourse of the time. But
                        those hierarchies are themselves dependent on deeper arrangements of social
                        life. In economic terms, the seemingly interminable years of conflict with
                        the French can fairly be seen as an era of interrupted potential, of hanging
                        on the brink. The exploitation of the colonies, and the steady progress of
                        commercial success attendant on that exploitation, did not cease to proceed,
                        but they progressed under uneasy conditions, constantly dependent on the
                        next phase of commercial sabre-rattling, the next round of Orders in
                        Council; and thus the war effort becomes increasingly seen as something to
                        be undertaken in order for something else to begin, as an increasingly <pb id="p15-190" n="190"/> burdensome impediment to the birth of a new age.
                        And, for instance, without this element within the popular imagination, this
                        prolonged "labor" which is both the production of munitions and
                        also the delayed attempt to give birth to a mythically stable Britain of the
                        future, all those difficult births which punctuate the Prophetic Books would
                        have been less bloody, and their place within the formal structures of the
                        poems less prominent.</p>
          <p>And equally, without the thunder of firearms, however empirically absent from
                        the English mainland, the thunderings of Orc and Urizen would seem parts of
                        a quite different vocabulary: the foregrounding of war as a fact of the
                        social life of the age is the essential prerequisite for historically
                        relevant and operable definitions of hyperbole, of clarity and opacity, and
                        even of volume. In the discourse of the time, the clamor of the guns is
                        important in many ways. For the Tories, it contains a double danger: that
                        hearing it might spark a corresponding rebellious clamor at home, and/or
                        that continental furor might obscure the sounds of unrest when they occur.
                        Against the first, there is always the weapon of repression of
                        communication, the setting up of resistances which will prevent the rapid
                        electric flow of revolutionary thought; against the second, the quieter
                        resource of spying, the ear which Pitt had always to keep uncomfortably
                        close to the ground, however grand an international posture he sought to
                        assume.</p>
          <p>In this context, as Bennett hints, the search for a plainer "language of
                        men" which constitutes one strand of English romanticism becomes
                        perceptibly a part of a wider set of social demands riddled through and
                        through with the political. Some of the major romantics may find their way
                        to pockets of silence, may be able to test subtle tuning-forks on the
                        mountains and the winds, but for the most part this collection (rightly, I
                        believe, eschewing the handful of productions which have come to dominate
                        the literary landscape of the period) shows us not soliloquy or refinement
                        of sensibility but stentorian bellowing, the endless repetition of image and
                        abstraction. The bellowing, the condensation of argument into ritual cries
                        of "liberty," "freedom," "justice," at first
                        appears to come from the mostly anonymous poets themselves and from the
                        newspaper editors; but as Bennett points out in an unashamedly derivative
                        but nonetheless very handy run-down of the politics of the press, even the
                        powerful editors are for the most part puppets, and the voices come from
                        over their shoulders, direct from the politicians. Under these
                        circumstances, freedom of speech is a dangerous risk, and one with which
                        neither Tory nor Whig felt happy. Too much was at stake; from a
                        psychological perspective, what seems to have been in the air was the
                        unpredictable outcome of a massive social ambivalence, itself the product of
                        conflict of allegiance between economic and national groupings. Ambivalence
                        and evasion here go hand in hand, for what the popular poetry reveals is a
                        set of contradictions which cannot be handled except by displacement, by the
                        shifting of historical, geographical, and social contexts.</p>
          <p>Yet in some ways this is too simple: certainly the politicians manipulated,
                        and certainly editors were under no misapprehension about their national
                        responsibilities. Yet it would clearly be hopelessly optimistic to argue
                        that therefore some hypothetical variety of "free" or even radical
                        poetry, some poetry which could see through chauvinism to
                        chauvinism’s economic and psychological functions, was suppressed,
                        except in the rarest instances. The operations of hegemony are more
                        all-embracing than that; and what is evidenced by the war poetry of
                        1793-1815, I would suggest, is an intense fear resulting in an equally
                        intense network of collusions. It is a familiar point that those poets of
                        the period who had some claim to be called working-class, here represented
                        especially by Cunningham and Bloomfield, tended towards formal and
                        ideological traditionalism; but it is more generally true that, as Bennett
                        puts it, "poets who supported the war as well as those who opposed it
                        use the same terms." Beneath differences of party politics we see the
                        emergence and consolidation of a unified vocabulary, as if the tension of
                        prolonged outward conflict were too great to permit inner discord. The
                        relation between warfare and national unity is close indeed, and it
                        generates an enormous power to absorb contradiction and produce it as
                        confirmation. When Britain can be referred to, as it is in
                        "Britain’s Genius Triumphant" (1807), as
                        "freedom-fost’ring" and "coop’d up" in two
                        successive lines, what we need to wonder about is the power of the
                        individual voice to survive under the pressure of fear, a fear increasingly
                        seen as related to invasion but actually concealing a more deeply-laid fear
                        of change and the destruction of stability. And the strategies by means of
                        which this fear is displaced supply us with keys to the underlying myth
                        against which the collusions are supposed to offer protection: it is a myth
                        of imminent sexual violation, as, clearly, Blake was well aware at the
                        time.</p>
          <p>There is of course, and especially in the early years of the war, a terror of
                        chaos, well exemplified in "The Farmer and Labourer" (1794):
                        "confusion whelms all forms, all properties; / And chaos reigns among
                        the sons of men, / Till God’s avenging arm restores fair Peace
                        again." The most important shapes for disorder are those we also find
                        in the Gothic, both Gothic fiction and the more immediately relevant
                        nationalistic and military Gothic represented by Macpherson’s <hi rend="i">Ossian</hi> and, in Bennett’s collection, by his many
                        imitators. But this discourse of chaos and order is usually unspecific,
                        lacking in vitality; it is in the imagery of a rousing song like "Stop
                        to a Stride," from <hi rend="i">The Gentleman’s Magazine</hi>
                        (1803), which has Napoleon raping each European country in turn, that
                        greater concreteness is invested. The political implications of a stance
                        which claims that first France herself, then "poor Switzerland"
                        and so on, have fallen victim to a violent sexual assault are manifold.
                        Primarily, it enables a consensus to be achieved around the difficult issue
                        of how to treat the French as, on the one hand, savage aggressors and, on
                        the other, the victims of a pseudo-egalitarian conspiracy. This is done by
                        separating out masculine and feminine characteristics, often along the lines
                        suggested by Burke’s potent image of the French queen. In a 1794
                        "Ode" from the <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine</hi>, the male French
                        are conjured away completely, so that the stalwart British can perform the
                        ideologically <pb id="p15-191" n="191"/> necessary function of protecting
                        French virgins (presumably also virgin minds, free from the taint of
                        Jacobinism) from damage. Frederick Atkinson’s "The
                        Emigrée" (1799) is typical of a genre in which French womanhood
                        is conveniently reduced to penury and orphanage, British commerce being
                        therefore her only means of survival. Helen Maria Williams, in her "Ode
                        to Peace" of 1801, appears to entertain hopes that all might come right
                        yet with a marriage between France and England, but for the most part so
                        benign a solution to the quandary seems very distant.</p>
          <p>This attempt to depotentiate the French, perhaps to remove an anxiety and an
                        envy that they, the old enemy, have managed to effect by revolution a
                        significant penetration of the historical fabric, becomes the key to the
                        dominant formal device of the collection, which, despite Wordsworth, is
                        personification. Real battles between real people are, subtly and not so
                        subtly, transmuted into battles of the giants, in which "Freedom"
                        and "Terror," "Liberty" and "Slaughter,"
                        "Peace" and "Rapine" are made to take on the agential
                        role in relation to historical action. A particularly revealing example
                        occurs in Scott’s "Bonaparte" (1811), where, after a first
                        verse in which the poet waxes rude about Napoleon’s low birth in a
                        "suburb hovel," and as we are apparently about to close in on the
                        picture, we learn that "before that Leader strode a shadowy form, / Her
                        limbs like mist, her torch like meteor show’d." This shadow
                        turns out, conventionally, to be "Ambition"; what is significant,
                        however, is her function as the "mist" which obscures real
                        historical connection. In "Peace more Desirable than War" (1793),
                        we find another use for personification when "Science,"
                        "Justice," "Virtue" and so forth are followed in the
                        same mode by "George," who can thus be conveniently translated to
                        a higher realm by a more than human process, providing a model of
                        "super-natural" sanction.</p>
          <p>And there are other devices which we could list, all of which help to obscure
                        agency: transmutation into animals, gods or devils, condensation into heroic
                        figures, and more intricate linguistic processes, mostly to do with
                        passivization and the suppression of the subject. The process which Blake
                        describes in <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, where he
                        provides so insightful an account of the social purposes of religion, can be
                        extended—indeed, should be extended—into the formation of
                        social myth, and it is clearly such a formation which is happening here,
                        especially if we accept that a major function of myth is to naturalize
                        contradiction. As a comment on the book, however, this is simply to say that
                        overall it is what it set out to be, a mine of information, and no more. The
                        introduction is a model of decorum, in which the minimal historical and
                        social facts are stated lucidly but without recourse to speculation. The
                        footnotes provide, as well as literary references, a sketchy narrative of
                        the principal events of the wars; indeed, such is the author’s zeal
                        that many of them appear twice, a habit which may well have been caught from
                        the emphatic style of the poetry itself.</p>
          <p>But perhaps historical narrative cannot really be so simple. The confident
                        celebrations of old English beef and pudding begin eventually to seem thin,
                        slightly desperate, like the skin of a system of ideas and control from
                        which the substance is gradually leaking. Yet the pressure exerted to
                        maintain the carapace is enormous; and here we get a glimpse of the forces
                        of cultural solidarity which drove Blake to such lengths. The principal
                        effort of poetry in these years, judging by this copious evidence, seems not
                        at all to have been to achieve direct communication with the hypothesized
                        "people," but rather to generate a connection between simplicity
                        of structure and abstract opacity of image, whereby the representation of
                        physical action could be turned into schematized mental conflict by a series
                        of increasingly minimal gestures. Vaunting abstractions are permitted to
                        "do things" to each other; individuals generally figure not as
                        actors but as patients, sufferers, sad and distant seamen, weeping widows.
                        And thus, of course, the hierarchy of the State is produced as the formal
                        limitation of poetry: while outwardly professing them to be made of oak, the
                        poets portray the "people" as cowering beneath the feet of mighty,
                        semi-invisible contestants, "Giant Forms" par excellence.</p>
          <p>The relation which Blake’s poetry bears, then, to this body of
                        work—and Bennett and I would agree, I think, in referring to it <hi rend="i">as</hi> a homogeneous body of work, although the nature of our
                        evidence would be different—is a complicated one. The root of that
                        relation lies in the fact that it is, in this poetry, Jacobin and
                        anti-Jacobin alike, always the French who are portrayed as desirous. The
                        English are firm and steadfast; or at least, they are perpetually about to
                        be called upon to be firm and steadfast. Towards the untoward events across
                        the Channel, policy permits a number of attitudes, from noisy cheering on of
                        our troops from the sidelines to averting the eyes and calling on the moral
                        virtues to save us from pollution. It also, on occasion, permits some rather
                        patchy satire. What, however, is inconceivable is that the British could
                        have outward-going desires, except the negative one of stopping the French;
                        and this despite the facts of colonization. The prevalent ideology clearly
                        did not allow connections between French and British imperialism, and thus
                        two separate streams of imagery are generated: the French commit assault,
                        the British protect and nurture their colonies like offspring or, perhaps
                        better, distant nieces. And it is interesting that when Blake tries to put
                        this severed world together, in <hi rend="i">America, Europe</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi>, he too finds it very difficult. There is
                        plenty of desire in America, and there is a set of economic truths applied
                        to Asia, but Europe remains the most puzzling of geographies, an apparent
                        fairyland where, nonetheless, the displaced sense of threat is a palpable
                        absence. The land fit for Englishmen to live in, a concern dear to the
                        hearts of many of these poets, is one-dimensional: it is a still point, at
                        which change can be forever avoided.</p>
          <p>In this particular context, Blake’s achievement is to continue to
                        wrestle with the exclusion of desire, and with the function of that
                        exclusion as a political device. There were poems being written in the last
                        decade of the eighteenth century whose professed purpose was to apply a
                        succession of <pb id="p15-192" n="192"/> proverbs, neatly and in order, to
                        scenes from the wars; under such circumstances, the "Proverbs of
                        Hell" seem all the more challenging. But, of course, myth is not
                        genuinely susceptible to opposition, nor even can it be destroyed or
                        modified by the construction of counter-myths; since its realm is
                        contradiction, it is capable of remaining unaffected by intellectual
                        weapons, modifying its contours only in a complex and variable relation with
                        changes in the underlying reality. A poem of 1813 entitled "National
                        Discord" is interesting in this context; the poet regrets the
                        contemporary lack of a "Thracian Lyrist . . . gifted with skill / To
                        humble the Tiger to crouch at his will," and bemoans the collapse of
                        the world into discord rather than the harmony which, of course, once
                        prevailed: <q> the Genius of bright intuition is fled;<lb/> And harmony
                            passed from the heart to the head;<lb/> No rapt inspiration now succours
                            the brave!<lb/> No sounds of the lyre are effectual to save!<lb/><lb/>
                            The reign is establish’d of Discord; delight<lb/> Exults in
                            narration of siege and of flight;<lb/> Where losses confuse in the
                            flames spreading-far,<lb/> And distresses in pageants and tumults of
                            war. </q> This, I believe, well illustrates ambivalence in contemporary
                        attitudes to the war; the assumed preoccupation of poets with the martial is
                        criticized, while at the same time the key terms "delight" and
                        "exults" are attached precisely to this condemned narration. For
                        "condemned narration," we could substitute "Bible of
                        Hell," and we would thus be enriching our sense of the relations
                        between Blakean narrative and history, while at the same time starting to
                        think in quite a Blakean way first about the specific shapes, the particular
                        inclusions and exclusions, which psychic energy can be made to assume by the
                        pressure of historical circumstance and then about the ideological
                        collusions which seek to protect people both from the threat of change and,
                        at the same time and inextricably, from the risk of taking on their own
                        power.</p>

          <p>After two books on Samuel Johnson, Leopold Damrosch, Jr. has now burst
                        forward unheralded to present <hi rend="i">Symbol and Truth in
                            Blake’s Myth.</hi><ref target="n78" type="note">1</ref> It is a
                        weighty tome which will be read by every serious student of Blake over the
                        next few years; the observations on "sex," "fatherhood,"
                        and the "spectre" if thought before have never been so well
                        expressed. Having stated my belief that the book should be widely read, I
                        hope I may be forgiven for taking the remaining space to wrestle in true
                        friendship with a gloriously Urizenic text. Let me begin with this
                        misreading: "As human beings if not as literary critics, we surely owe
                        [Damrosch] Blake the obligation of testing his [criticism] myth against our
                        experience of [Blake] truth, which is no more than doing what he constantly
                        begs us to do [unsure]. . . . But as critics we must go further and try to
                        understand why [Damrosch’s criticism] <pb id="p15-193" n="193"/>
                        Blake’s myth takes the unsatisfying form that it does. To do so will
                        reveal his final ambivalence . . . " (239-40). <note id="n78"><hi rend="s">1</hi> In the most recent of the preceding books, <hi rend="i">The Uses of Johnson’s Criticism</hi> (1976),
                            Damrosch still held to the vision of "Blake, the champion of minute
                            particulars."</note></p>
          <p>Return to the title, the awkward indefiniteness of which is immediately
                        apparent as one pauses to run through its equally compelling permutations.
                        The rationale for the second term, "truth," is that "As a
                        prophet Blake claims to announce the truth, and I have entitled this study
                            <hi rend="i">Symbol and Truth</hi> because I think it important to
                        consider how his poems might be perceived as true by modern readers"
                        (9). The language is curious only until we realize that it is standard
                        Academese: distancing and subject/self-effacing (how <hi rend="i">perhaps</hi> "perceived" not by Damrosch but nameless
                        "modern readers"; reporting, non-judgmentally, Blake’s
                        "claims") in the midst of its very self-assertion ("because I
                        think it important"). As it will turn out in the final consideration,
                        "If Blake deliberately cuts himself off from the phenomenology of lived
                        experience, and if the modern reader cannot join him in that exclusion, why
                        should one read him?" (368). Disregarding the two "particularly
                        compelling" academic reasons, I would suggest that the true modern
                        reader does join in that exclusion—the young Blake readers of the new
                        age, who believe as well in imaginary numbers, the genetic code, black
                        holes, and floating keeps in computer programs, are indeed moving ever
                        further from the phenomenology of Damrosch’s nostalgic, Wordsworthian
                        "lived experience" (we are told, regretfully, that "There can
                        be no Wordsworthian solitary reaper in Blake . . . and no Michael . . .
                        "; that, "In the end . . . Blake cannot come to terms with
                        [Wordsworth’s image of] ‘ . . . the very world which is the
                        world / Of all of us" [366-67, 368]).</p>
          <p>The first word of this book’s title, "symbol," is its most
                        important and problematic one; significantly (or symbolically?) enough, it
                        never appears in Blake’s text in any form. Damrosch, however, is
                        concerned with "the issues" raised by Blake, and central to this
                        focus is Blake’s "exposure of the problem of symbolism,"
                        "his exploration of the possibilities and limits of the symbol"
                        (7, 368). One is left with the impression that this also is
                        Damrosch’s vision of his own achievement. The obvious question,
                        "What is a symbol?", would quickly propel us beyond Damrosch and
                        into the deep space of contemporary poetics; but since the concept of
                        "symbol" appears on nearly every page, it is essential to try to
                        understand what Damrosch means by it. "Symbols are not simple
                        signs"—they are "‘dense with meaning’"
                        and so "any simple translation of symbol into ‘meaning’
                        reduces it once more to a sign" (67, 68, 65).</p>
          <p>Damrosch argues that "The symbol for Blake is more than a magnetic field
                        of emotional charges or a cognitive system within which experience can be
                        organized. It is our best and subtlest means of insight into reality. The
                        sun looks like a disk but is human" (69). "But in Blake’s
                        theory," says Damrosch, "owing to his suspicion of the fallen
                        world, symbols are vitiated by their fallen status, for example in the
                        various versions of the sun." "Therefore," this argument
                        continues, the symbols "point to, or participate in a reality which is
                        more vivid and immediate than they are, <hi rend="i">so long as</hi> we can
                        achieve an apocalyptic breakthrough and ascend into vision on the fiery
                        chariot of the imagination" (362). Heady stuff.</p>
          <p>By "vision," Blake "means a mode of perception that sees
                        through symbols rather than with them" (302).<ref target="n79" type="note">2</ref> "All thinking," by way of evident contrast
                        to vision, is of a "symbolic character" (256). "We therefore
                        have slippery and ambiguous symbols pointing to a more vivid and organized
                        reality ‘within’" (362). This "reality,"
                        Damrosch has to argue implicitly, is itself symbolic or hypothetical, since
                        "Blake openly defies the reality principle" by means of his
                        "wish fulfillment on a cosmic scale that . . . chooses to deny
                        essential facts of human experience" (163, 70). This ostensibly
                        meta-symbolic and transcendent Blakean reality depends finally on "an
                        act of faith—which the reader must postulate even if he does not
                        share"—since "Invariably we are brought back to the
                        necessity of the divine" (69, 314). We read Blake, then (now), "to
                        know what it would be like to believe in man’s spiritual power"
                        (368). These opinions resonate movingly with the author’s most
                        telling statement in the book: "I myself (to speak frankly) have no
                        religious belief" (246). Reading in Damrosch’s concluding
                        paragraph that the entire exercise "would have a merely antiquarian
                        function if Blake did not possess the power of a religious vision"
                        (371), one cannot resist wondering, "Did he put on his knowledge with
                        his power?" <note id="n79"><hi rend="s">2</hi> To assert the reality of
                            vision, Damrosch cites several mescaline experiences (none his own) and
                            concludes, "I have thought this documentation important—and
                            it could be multiplied many times over—because it should compel
                            [!] a recognition that Blake’s visions were actual experiences,
                            not merely poetic metaphors" (49).</note></p>
          <p>Let us return to "the issue" of "unsatifying form" and
                        "final ambivalence": "The purpose of [Damrosch’s
                        criticism] Blake’s myth is far from being merely descriptive. It is
                        prescriptive . . . " (150). Hence such dicta as "the invention of
                        states represents a decisive change in Blake’s myth, and I think an
                        unfortunate one"; "I propose to establish an intellectual context
                        that will show not only what Blake seems to mean, but also why he finds it
                        so hard to mean what he wants"; "his representations of Female
                        Will would have been less tendentious if he had made more of the symbolism
                        of Lilith"; "Blake’s real mistake, if I may bluntly call it
                        that, was to give in to the dualist impulse and to dismiss sexuality to
                        Beulah" (154, 176, 219, 234).</p>
          <p>Let me make clear what I think is going on. To talk about "symbols"
                        is to posit the existence of "another" text, of latent meanings,
                        and thus the concomitant necessity (since "A symbolic language has to
                        be interpreted" [116]) of an interpreter, a wise guardian of the text
                        and context. <hi rend="i">Cui bono</hi>? Recognizing that "To say what
                        a given symbol means in Blake’s work is impossible except in an
                        extended essay on its various specific meanings" (107), Damrosch has
                        projected instead a royal road of interpreting the nature of Blakean
                        symbolization. His book is "a study in philosophical
                        interpretation" which is, anyway, "logically prior to
                        commentary"; it is, indeed, a "metacommentary" (4, 5). Like
                        its title, the book’s chapters offer abstract categories such as
                        "The Truth of Symbols," "God and Man." Early on,
                        Damrosch cites Blake’s reported remark, "‘I can look at a
                        knot in a piece of wood till I am frightened at it,’" and finds
                        the implication that "a fixity of gaze would compel the object to yield
                        up its hidden <pb id="p15-194" n="194"/> meaning" (42). Perhaps we hear
                        an abstracted echo of this when we read, later, that our author "will
                        explore some philosophical reasons for the knottiest problems in
                        Blake’s myth," the meanings that "baffle
                        interpretation," that "give trouble because they cannot be
                        coherently reconciled" (113-14). Appropriately enough, he fixes his
                        gaze longest—for over a fifth of the book—on "The Problem
                        of Dualism" (every Blakean symbol "has a dual significance"
                        [290]) and there, most "compellingly," on "Sex." One
                        hopes that these fine discussions were as therapeutic for Damrosch as he
                        holds Blake’s myth to have been for its creator (152, 311).</p>
          <p>Damrosch’s concern "with contexts rather than sources" (6)
                        is at times misguided. Context, again, is something the (meta-) commentator
                            decides<ref target="n80" type="note">3</ref>—but it is time that
                        we start discovering "intertext" rather than projecting context,
                        which is to say, it is time we started producing the text rather than
                        abstracting its "meaning." For example, Damrosch quotes
                        Blake’s description that "the Plowman of Chaucer is Hercules in
                        his supreme eternal state, divested of his spectrous shadow, which is the
                        Miller . . . ," and observes that "In mythological terms, [the
                        two] combine to make up Hercules, whom the ancient mythographers failed to
                        recognize as a divided being." They "did not understand that their
                        Hercules was a composite being. Blake’s myth exists not to confirm
                        traditional intuitions but to make new sense of them" (82). Well and
                        good—but a little more concern for source/intertext would not be
                        amiss. In the underworld of the <hi rend="i">Odyssey</hi> we see Hercules,
                        in the translation of Pope that Blake was possibly reading with Hayley at
                        the time, "A tow’ring spectre of gigantic mold, / A shadowy
                        form" (11.742-43). One fascinating aspect of Hercules is that
                        "high in heav’n’s abodes / Himself resides, a God among
                        the Gods," whereas "here" ghosts surround "his
                        shade" (743-44, 747). Pope observes in a note to the passage that it
                        offers "full evidence of the partition of the human composition into
                        three parts: The body is buried in the earth; the image or ειδολον descends
                        into the regions of the departed; and the soul, or the divine part of man,
                        is receiv’d into heaven." Needless to say this conception of a
                        divided or composite being suggests <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> as well. <note id="n80"><hi rend="s">3</hi> Or decides can’t be decided:
                            "the visionary episodes . . . are the ultimate context of his
                            myth" (44).</note></p>
          <p>Again, Damrosch’s emphasis on analogous context can distract us from a
                        more interesting textuality. He relates that, according to Hans Jonas, in
                        the "Gnostic philosophy of Valentinus, ‘matter would appear to
                        be a function rather than a substance on its own, a state of the
                        "affection" of the absolute being, and the solidified external
                        expression of that state. . . . This substance, then, psychical as well as
                        material, is nothing else than a self-estranged and sunken form of the
                        Spirit solidified . . . ’" (168). Damrosch adds, "Every
                        word of this description can be applied to Blake, not because he
                        ‘was’ a Gnostic but because the Gnostic form of Neoplatonism
                        arrived at similar answers by an analogous route." But perhaps
                        Blake’s is not an arbitrary dualism severing the spiritual and the
                        material, "defining one half of the duality out of existence."
                        Perhaps it represents, in part, an attempt to incorporate contemporary
                        "scientific reality." As Blake would have read in the <hi rend="i">Principia</hi>, "The vapors which arise from the sun . . . may
                        meet at last with, and fall into, the atmospheres of the planets by their
                        gravity, and there be condensed and turned into water and humid spirits; and
                        from thence, by a slow heat, pass gradually into the form of salts, and
                        sulphurs, and tinctures, and mud, and clay, and sand, and stones, and coral,
                        and other terrestrial substances."<ref target="n81" type="note">4</ref><note id="n81"><hi rend="s">4</hi> Florian Cajori, ed. <hi rend="i">Sir

          <p>The importance of science or "scientific myth" as a
                        context/intertext persists throughout Blake’s work. "The final
                        vision of the Zoas," notes Damrosch, "conversing in visionary
                        forms dramatic, represents them as ‘going forward irresistable from
                        Eternity to Eternity’ [<hi rend="i">J</hi> 98.27], a phrase which we
                        have seen in Boehme and which probably derives from biblical locutions like
                        ‘from everlasting to everlasting’" (341). But again, this
                        is in part Blake’s revision of Newton’s "living,
                        intelligent, and powerful Being" whose duration reaches "from
                        eternity to eternity."<ref target="n82" type="note">5</ref><note id="n82"><hi rend="s">5</hi> Cajori, p. 545; this is from the

                            Creating Time" (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 98.13).</note></p>
          <p>"In his positive vein," writes Damrosch, "Blake describes art
                        as organized vision that transforms appearances." He cites the
                        beautiful passage in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, "‘Thou seest the
                        gorgeous clothd flies that dance &amp; sport in summer,’" and
                        finds that "their random swarming [becomes] an intricate dance."
                        But, he would remind us, "the vision of the dancing flies is
                        Los’s conceit, a work of imagination which is only a temporary
                        transformation of the fallen world." The dance-message of bees is a
                        world of delight closed to this critic.<ref target="n83" type="note">6</ref>
                        So too, for him, "The lark [in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>] is not
                        significant in itself, as an actual bird, but as a symbol of prophetic
                        inspiration, which is made clear a little later in the image of a relay of
                        larks as heavenly messengers. ‘To Immortals, the Lark is a mighty
                        Angel’" (86). Are we not Immortals, for a lark? Remarkable
                        symbol, to lead "the Choir of Day! trill, trill, trill, trill"

                            "fly," see OED. This example is generated retrospectively, but
                            then, "What is now proved was once, only
                            imagin’d."</note></p>
          <p>For me, the most difficult aspect of this book concerns the author’s
                        conception of Blake’s language. A practitioner of "philosophical
                        interpretation," Damrosch approvingly cites Wittegenstein:
                        "‘Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our
                        intelligence by means of language.’ So is Blake’s
                        poetry," he adds (358). To which I answer, forgetting who said it,
                        "Poetry is too important to be left to philosophers!" The crucial
                        term here, even more difficult than Damrosch’s "symbol," is
                            <hi rend="i">word.</hi> While recognizing that "Blake exhibits an
                        almost Joycean awareness of the manipulability of words," Damrosch
                        knows that "behind the words he sees a divine vision to which they
                        point, and has little interest in words for their own sake" (73). Words
                        are opake bricks in "‘the stubborn structure’ of the
                        Language"—a quotation to which Damrosch continually returns.
                        Language is one more of those "barriers to vision" (like images,
                        phenomena, symbols [42, 69, 302]), that we must learn to see through (73,
                        328): "how could the structure not be stubborn? Syntax is tyrannical,
                        forcing us to think along its lines, and every individual word is haunted by
                        associations that the user cannot escape" (326). Blake’s
                        liberties with syntax and normal association are for Damrosch only further
                        indications of Blake’s "determination to make us break through
                        language" (326).</p>
          <pb id="p15-195" n="195"/>
          <p>Discussing <hi rend="i">Adam Naming the Beasts</hi>, Damrosch proposes that
                        "in the very act of <hi rend="i">naming</hi>, in choosing human symbols
                        with which to represent experience, man has committed himself to the
                        Fall" (90). But is the word, in its practical and conceptual reality, a
                        human symbol? Damrosch neglects to acknowledge that both <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> end with <hi rend="i">onomastic</hi> "visions" ("I heard it namd,"
                        "I heard the Name," <hi rend="i">M</hi> 42.15, <hi rend="i">J</hi>
                        99.5). Perceiving that there is something particular about Blake’s
                        relation to the word, Damrosch admits that "in Eternity . . . words
                        become truly creative as in the symbolism of the first chapter of
                        John’s gospel . . . rather than a stubborn structure" (327). So,
                        "When Albion awakens he is heard ‘speaking the Words of Eternity
                        in Human Forms,’" and these "Words are not signs but living
                        beings. . . . And conversation must therefore be more than language as we
                        know it, the stubborn structure of Los" (346). Curiously enough, these
                        living words which Damrosch would confine to Blake’s Eternity have
                        escaped to his own text twelve pages on: "Blake’s words will not
                        stay on the page as objects of aesthetic contemplation; they invade the
                        reader’s mind and attempt to transform his world" (358).<ref target="n84" type="note">7</ref> These are indeed the agents of a <hi rend="i">stubborn</hi> structure (let us consult the OED):
                        "refusing obedience, unyielding, untameable, difficult to
                            subdue."<ref target="n85" type="note">8</ref> Blake’s genius
                        is that he recognizes this divine, transcendental, Orcian energy in the
                        word. Where Damrosch sees his "slippery and ambiguous symbols pointing
                        to a more vivid and organized reality ‘within,’" one
                        might instead see definite and polysemous words pointing to the vivid and
                        organized reality within their structure: a vision of telos we could call
                        imagination/the word/Jesus. Why, after all, does language exist? Why do we
                        yield up the question of its origins? And here also I must dissent from the
                        author’s view that "Blake’s dream of visionary truth is
                        fundamentally incompatible with modern theories of intertextuality,
                        indeterminacy, and deconstructive license" (355). The Book of
                        Revelation is indeed "a very different model from the speculations of
                        Jacques Derrida," but such contemporary explorations show us in words
                        and texts the vortex long foretold.<ref target="n86" type="note">9</ref>
                        Barthes’ "galaxy of signifiers" adjoins Blake’s

                            this, or perhaps it’s just one of those Blakean incoherences, for
                            we read a few pages later that "It is crucially significant that
                            the words are engraved . . . so that instead of allowing them to pass
                            into our minds as if they spoke themselves inside our heads, we are
                            forced—or would be if we used Blake’s original
                            texts—to see them as objects put there by a human artist"

                            description in the preceding verse, "English, the rough
                            basement," "stubborn" may be pointing toward a stylistic
                            description of the mother tongue as "Harsh; rough; rugged"
                            (Johnson). Yet the terms "basement" and
                            "structure"—appearing only here in Blake’s
                            poetry—certainly suggest something like Heidegger’s vision
                            that "Language is the house of Being. Man dwells in this house.

          <p>Consider another example of "Blakean symbolism, which continually
                        disturbs our imaginations with its aggressive strangeness. After Satan
                        seizes the harrow of Palamabron and reduces his servants to drunken
                        confusion, ‘Los took off his left sandal placing it on his head, /
                        Signal of solemn mourning.’ This is a symbolic action that demands a
                        gloss, not a ‘natural representation’" (94). Damrosch
                        does not offer that gloss (this being a metacommentary, one supposes), but
                        goes on to ask, typically, "Would an exemplar of the poet in Wordsworth
                        put a sandal on his head?" I suggest that this is not so much a
                        symbolic act as a linguistic one—an act whose "symbolism"
                        is its praxis, which is "more than language as we know it, the stubborn
                        structure of Los."</p>
          <p>We need first to remember the surrounding text: the servants of the mill riot
                            <q> With ecchoing confusion, tho’ the Sun was risen on high.<lb/>
                            Then Los took off his left sandal placing it on his head,<lb/> Signal of
                            solemn mourning<lb/> (<hi rend="i">M</hi> 8. 10-12) </q> "Ecchoing
                        confusion" here indicates the manner in which the words that follow are
                        to be understood. Thus "Sun" becomes the "sandal" which
                        is in turn the "signal of solemn mourning." This is another
                        version of what appears in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> as "that Signal
                        of the Morning which was told us in the Beginning" (<hi rend="i">J</hi>
                        93. 26),<ref target="n87" type="note">10</ref> the beginning in which was
                        the living word, the <hi rend="i">logon zooās</hi> (λογον ζοης) of
                        Golgonooza. As the Sun was risen "<hi rend="i">on high</hi>," so
                        Los places the sandal "<hi rend="i">on his</hi> head." The sandal
                        is the signal which the servants behold, and its rising initiates the
                        mourning, the awareness of loss. What will later be the sandal of the
                        vegetable world, the vehicle, the signifier, is here seen as the
                        intellectual sun-head, the sign itself. The passage discloses a mode of
                        productivity distinct from the odd picture ("symbol") offered by
                        the narrative; indeed, the description seems to be intentionally
                        "unfortunate" (Stevenson’s annotation) in order to draw
                        attention to the process of literal transformation at work. Thus in this
                        passage <hi rend="i">s</hi>u<hi rend="i">n</hi> becomes ri<hi rend="i">s</hi>e<hi rend="i">n</hi>, becomes Los or sol anagrammatically, and
                        then becomes <hi rend="i">s</hi>a<hi rend="i">n</hi>da<hi rend="i">l</hi>
                        becomes <hi rend="i">s</hi>ig<hi rend="i">n</hi>a<hi rend="i">l</hi> becomes
                            <hi rend="i">s</hi>o<hi rend="i">l</hi>/em<hi rend="i">n</hi>—and
                        all ending with mourning. The underlying theme, in word and letter (<hi rend="i">o</hi>’s occur here at twice Blake’s average
                        rate, as randomly sampled), is the sun; this should not surprise Damrosch,
                        who offers a section on "Symbolic Knowing: The Example of the
                        Sun." This theme may be called the "hypogram," the term
                        introduced by Saussure in his strange investigation of Latin verse to
                        characterize "the inducing word": the word or small group of words
                        which he supposed "led, by way of phonetic paraphrase, to the
                        elaboration of the poem" (Starobinski). Saussure hoped to discover a
                        law of poetic composition, and while such a conception is incredible, it
                        does seem that in the passage at hand the Poetic Genius (not to be
                        identified with the conscious poet) writes from a pre-text concerning the
                        sun. The effect of such literal play parallels that which Maureen Quilligan
                        posits for wordplay in allegory: it makes the reader "self-conscious of
                        reading by indicating the primary importance of the verbal surface rather
                        than the imagined action." Such expanded considerations make the reader
                        more conscious of the various paths to the production of meaning: the simple
                        but serious realization that there is more at work than meets the everyday
                        sleepy eye (or ear) is enough: the glimmering indication that there are
                        worlds of delight closed by our common sense, our expectation, our symbolic
                            projections,<ref target="n88" type="note">11</ref> awakens another sense
                        for that delight, the sense that "Reason or the ratio of all we have
                        already known is not the same that it shall be when we know more" (<hi rend="i">NNRb</hi>): a sense of process, of our passing presence in the
                        exfoliation of the word. S-u-n perhaps serves in such a generating position
                        in the passage since—to use a Swedenborgian intertext—the Lord
                        is the Word, which is the spiritual sun, which is the only real existence
                        and the conjunction between man and itself: the Poetic Genius centers on the
                        word "sun" as another name for the word and for itself. <note id="n87"><hi rend="s">10</hi> This points to the important Blakean
                            homonym morning/mourning which I will not discuss except to observe that
                            it helps to explain the contradiction in seeing that "every morning
                                <hi rend="i">is</hi> a completed desire" even though "the
                            recurrence of spring, even in the gladness of its songs, is a symptom of
                            the cyclical prison of the fallen world" (53, 86).</note><note id="n88"><hi rend="s">11</hi> "‘The Eye altering alters
                            all’ occurs in a poem that describes the imprisoning cycle of the
                            fallen world," says Damrosch (27)—but it doesn’t so
                            much describe as <hi rend="i">inscribe</hi>: do we naively believe that
                            "all is done as <hi rend="i">I</hi> have told"?</note></p>
          <p>Damrosch "must reject Frye’s suggestion that the key to
                        Blake’s thought is the synonymity of <pb id="p15-196" n="196"/>
                        ‘form’ and ‘image.’" Projecting unbindable
                        duality everywhere, he explains, "On the contrary, form belongs to the
                        eternal realm and image to the sensory"; and from this "We see how
                        profoundly Blake needed a religious assurance of union with the one central
                        Form" (44). But Frye’s "synonymity" is precisely the
                        energy or space embodied in the word, which joins form and image and is
                        discontinuous with the world. At the beginning of <hi rend="i">The Four
                            Zoas</hi> Blake directs us to John 1:14, quoting the last part in Greek:
                        "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." And the reason,
                        according to the other reference to John, is "That they all may be one.
                        . . . " Albion, if one will. It is language, the medium of
                        communication and communion, in which we are one; it is the word which is
                        the true subject. As Los "built" the stubborn structure, so
                            "<hi rend="i">the words</hi> of man to man. . . . build the
                        Universe stupendous: Mental forms Creating" (<hi rend="i">M</hi> 30.
                        18-20, my italics). Where Damrosch sees us "confined to a world in
                        which the word is woven into the garment of the Shadowy Female" (328),
                        we can change the metaphysics and see the word weaving textuality, hear
                        "the voice of the shuttle."<ref target="n89" type="note">12</ref>
                        The rich ambiguity Damrosch is wont to find in Blake appears revealingly in
                        his own comment on a quotation from Eliade: "‘The myth is
                        supposed to happen . . . in a non-temporal time, in an instant without
                        duration, as certain mystics and philosophers conceived of eternity.’
                        In a word, as Blake conceived of it" (353). <note id="n89"><hi rend="s">12</hi> "Los answerd swift as the shuttle of gold" (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 92.13).</note></p>
          <p>This book, like all of its sort but more than some, is an exercise in
                        academic power. It does not wear its learning lightly—a footnote to
                        Pascal detains us with the information that "Pascal’s term <hi rend="i">jetée</hi> is strikingly anticipatory of
                        Heidegger’s <hi rend="i">geworfen</hi>" (233); a note on <hi rend="i">The Recluse</hi> tells that "Both the thought and the
                        meditative music—filled with anticipatory echoes of Stevens’
                            <hi rend="i">Sunday Morning</hi>— are radically un-Blakean"
                        (87). We are told with astonishment that "the Blakean phrase
                        ‘prolific energy’ appears—of all places;—in
                        Burke’s <hi rend="i">Reflections on the Revolution in
                        France</hi>" (148), when there is no such phrase in Blake; the <hi rend="i">Merkabah</hi> is introduced without any explanation for the
                        unlearned (240); "an electrical circuit plugged in to itself"
                        appears as the impossible image of "an internal economy of perpetual
                        stability" (239); we learn that "the problem of the divine is
                        ubiquitous," but also that "Cruelty is ubiquitous" (244,
                        252). We hear too often that "It has been said . . . ," "In
                        other words . . . ," "It is easy to see . . . ," "No
                        doubt . . . " (e.g. 96, 97, 103, 252), and also, usually with a
                        negative tone, what "Blakeans" think. "A true acceptance of
                        opposites demands a skeptical temperament and a commitment to things as they
                        are" (242), says the same author who warns against dangers in "The
                        zeal to domesticate [Blake] for English Literature" (308). We see
                        Damrosch’s zeal for things as they are in his "denial" of
                        opposing flights of fancy (see 105, 239).</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Symbol and Truth in Blake’s Myth</hi> is, then, a
                        forceful and at times seductive attempt to inscribe Blake with the
                        traditional issues of subject-oriented philosophy. I would rather wish,
                        "loving the greatest men best," our continual effort to subject
                        ourselves to Blake. For myself, I deny that "In learning Blake’s
                        grammar we learn how to use his vocabulary; when we fail, it is either
                        because we have not understood imaginatively enough or because he has not
                        shown us what he means" (81). We fail because we do not pay due
                        attention to the "Litteral Expression": "Mark well my words .

          <p>It is hard for me to believe that this could be an idea whose time has come.
                        In two taped lectures of about forty-five minutes each, a British schoolmarm
                        with a good BBC Third Programme accent leads us on a docent tour of the <hi rend="i">Songs Of Innocence and Of Experience.</hi> Along the way she
                        offers us a little history, a little biography, some judicious glosses from
                        other works by Blake, and a glimpse of the Major Themes: Energy,
                        Imagination, Contraries, Apocalypse, Revolution, Rationality,
                        Priestcraft—all described clearly, succinctly and soberly. The tape
                        is, in effect, a kind of low-tech <hi rend="i">Cliff Notes.</hi></p>
          <p>This is not to say that it is without merit. As an introduction, one can
                        hardly fault it. Professor Bottrall is an epitome of Anglo-American critical
                        common-sense, and she covers an impressive amount of territory. She sees
                        Blake’s work in his career and his career in his century. She deals
                        fairly effectively with relationships between text and illustrations. She
                        knows about textual alterations in copies of the <hi rend="i">Songs.</hi>
                        She is skeptical of reading Blake as a doctrinal mystic. She keeps it
                        simple, but not at the expense of irony and enigma. And she only
                        occasionally lapses into sententiousness, as when she claims that
                        "Blake restores to us our lost innocence. . . . Art can make good that
                        loss, but life cannot"; or when she gently dismisses the later work
                        because Blake’s "schemes are too arbitrary, his nomenclature too
                        individualistic, ever to commend his reading of superhuman nature to the
                        generality of men." One wishes, at such moments, that she were on hand,
                        so that one could ask a pointed question about generality, or remind her
                        that Blake was not interested in that which could be made explicit to an
                        idiot.</p>
          <p>The problem is not really with Professor Bottrall’s interpretations,
                        which are good enough for an introduction. Indeed, the perspectives she maps
                        out are probably much the same as those with which many of Blake’s
                        most sophisticated readers began. The problem is rather one of medium, of
                        appropriate form, of pedagogical viability. How are students to listen to
                        this? With their hands folded on their desks? Certainly, slides of the
                        relevant plates could be shown with the lecture, but would that be enough?
                        The tape is designed to be heard by high school and beginning college
                        students, but it is really <hi rend="i">for teachers</hi> who have to teach
                        Blake but feel they know little or nothing about him. Professor Bottrall
                        serves <hi rend="i">them</hi>, as a guest lecturer or substitute
                        teacher.</p>
          <p>If teachers believe they need this tape, they should listen to it at home and
                        work out some positions on the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> for themselves. But
                        no student should be forced to endure it. Professor Bottrall wants to
                        interest students in Blake, but to do that you need to involve them in an
                        active encounter with the texts, to interrogate them and be prepared for
                        their questions. You should not just point out and explain details, but show
                        a slide and get the students to discover for themselves significant
                        pictorial and textual details. You should not tell them that the language of
                        the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> is simple and musical, but get them to recite
                        the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> until they experience at least something of
                        their simplicity and music. You should not tell them that the nomenclature
                        of the later work is complex and formidable, but encourage them to explore,
                        say, "Tirzah," in a kind of paranomastic free association until at
                        least some of the name’s allusions are clearly experienced. I find it
                        hard to believe that, in a tape-and-slide show of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, students would be likely to profit from or retain much of
                        Professor Bottrall’s short course; it would, I suspect, be the fiery
                        images of the plates themselves into which the students would be drawn. And
                        it is that attraction which should be encouraged and developed.</p>

          <p>A recurring fascination in the reading of Blake is to wonder how some of his
                        statements and exhortations would feel if lived out in a real
                        life—one’s own, for example. Many of the novelists who have
                        used Blake have explored this question, from a variety of perspectives.
                        Joyce Cary in <hi rend="i">The Horse’s Mouth</hi> gave us one version
                        of the artist as hero, living out his own interpretation of Blake. Colin
                        Wilson’s <hi rend="i">The Glass Cage</hi> made its hero a Blake
                        critic, but an oddly reclusive one, who appears a little ambivalent in his
                        lived responses to the poet, and is now writing about Whitehead.</p>
          <p>Both these novels are well known, but readers of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> may
                        not know the next two novels, which sparked this note. The first is R. F.
                        Nelson’s <hi rend="i">Blake’s Progress</hi> (Toronto: Laser
                        Books, 1975), which starts as a rather engaging biography of Blake,
                        beginning with his marriage. It reveals that Kate remained a virgin for many
                        years, was responsible for most of Blake’s successful commercial
                        engravings, and was generally invaluable. It also tells us that
                        Blake’s poetry is not really poetic fiction at all, but that the
                        prophecies are full of names and images "taken from William’s
                        adventures as a time-voyageur through the alternate worlds, used to comment
                        on the current political and social scene" (pp. 108-09). The book is
                        fun, up to a point, but very literal at heart; Blake becomes a hero, but at
                        the expense of his poetry, which becomes simply a fancy kind of space travel
                        reporting.</p>
          <p>The second book is very different. It is by a writer often labeled as a
                        writer of science fiction, but in this case he bypasses science and
                        technology completely. J. G. Ballard’s <hi rend="i">The Unlimited
                            Dream Company</hi> (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1979) is a
                        tale about a young man called, simply, Blake. He is a not very successful
                        creature of the twentieth century, and no explicit attempt is made to relate
                        him to our William, except the name—and the story. One might begin a
                        description by suggesting that it explores what it would be like to
                        experience some of Blake’s central metaphors, or that it is a kind of
                        narrative version of "Auguries of Innocence" and "To my
                        Friend Butts I write." In its progress, it almost convinces the reader
                        that "vices in this world may well be metaphors for virtues in the
                        next," offers vivid intuitions of what the vortices described in Plate
                        15 of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> might feel like, and puts into narrative play
                        Blake’s musings about identity and identification. By omitting all
                        reference to Blake’s life and writings, Ballard has written a <hi rend="i">tour de force</hi> that in some ways gets closer to the heart
                        of Blake’s vision than the more explicitly Blakean novels. [<hi rend="i">My thanks to Roberto Cucci and Barbara Heppner for drawing my
                            attention to the last two novels.</hi>]</p>

          <p>William Blake derived the name and characteristics of his figure Orc from a
                        variety of sources, combining them to produce the various aspects of the
                        character in such poems as <hi rend="i">America, The Four Zoas</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Song of Los.</hi> The hellish aspects of Orc probably come
                        from the Latin <hi rend="i">Orcus</hi>, the abode of the dead in Roman
                        mythology and an alternate name for Dis, the god of the underworld. In <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi>, Ijim describes Tiriel’s house, after his
                        sons have expelled him, as "dark as vacant Orcus."<ref target="n90" type="note">1</ref> The libidinous aspect of Orc may well
                        come, as David Erdman has suggested, from the Greek ὄρχεις,
                            "testicles."<ref target="n91" type="note">2</ref>
                        "Orcs," from the Latin <hi rend="i">orca</hi>, "whale,"
                        appear in <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>, a poem much read by Blake, and in
                            <hi rend="i">America</hi> Orc appears symbolically as "sometimes a
                            whale."<ref target="n92" type="note">3</ref> Finally, in
                        Hoole’s version of <hi rend="i">Orlando Furioso</hi>, for which Blake
                        prepared an engraving in 1783, the poet would have noted that "the word
                            <hi rend="i">orca</hi> . . . is applied to any monster or creature of
                        the imagination [and] occurs in Milton."<ref target="n93" type="note">4</ref> But Orc also appears as a fiery figure in association with
                        Mount Atlas; these aspects of the figure derive from Jacob Bryant’s
                            <hi rend="i">New System, Or, an Analysis of Ancient Mythology</hi>
                        (first published in 1774), which Blake as a young apprentice may have had a
                        hand in illustrating.<ref target="n94" type="note">5</ref> We know that the
                        poet thought highly of the work, as his remark in the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> makes clear: "The antiquities of every
                        Nation under Heaven, is no less sacred than that of the Jews. They are the
                        same thing, as Jacob Bryant and all antiquaries have proved."<ref target="n95" type="note">6</ref><note id="n90"><hi rend="s">1</hi><hi rend="i"> The Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>, ed. David V.

          <p>In Bryant’s chapter entitled "Of Ancient Worship, and of
                        Etymological Truths Thence Deducible," Blake would have found the
                        theory that the Hercynian Forest in Germany gets its name from the Greek
                        δρυμός ὀρχύνιος, "the forest of Orcun."<ref target="n96" type="note">7</ref>
                        Bryant goes on to note that at the edge of this forest stands a mountain,
                        the name of which, Pyrene, "signifies a fountain of fire," because
                        the "mountain had once flamed. . . . The country therefore and the
                        forest may have been called Orcunian upon this account. For as the worship
                        of the Sun, the Deity of fire, prevailed greatly at places of this nature, I
                        make no doubt Hercynia, which Ptolemy expresses ὀρχυνια, was so named from
                        Or-cun, the God of that element."<ref target="n97" type="note">8</ref>
                        Bryant goes on to theorize that one of the "Puratheia, or open temples,
                        for the celebration of the rites of fire," may have stood on Mount
                        Atlas: "This Atlas (of which I have been speaking) is a mountain with a
                        cavity, and of a tolerable height, which the natives esteem both as a
                        temple, and a <pb id="p15-199" n="199"/> Deity."<ref target="n98" type="note">9</ref> These passages in Bryant stand as another source of
                        the name of Orc, and may in part lie behind Blake’s assertions that
                        "The cave of Orc stood to the South, a furnace of dire flames,"
                        and that "Orc on Mount Atlas howld, chain’d down with the Chain

          <p>This major loan exhibition will demonstrate the imaginative scope of
                        Blake’s interests, the high quality of his graphic art, and the
                        technical inventiveness into which he combined verse and illustration. It
                        will also explore new interpretations of his work in the light of the
                        intellectual and aesthetic currents of his times.</p>
          <p>David Bindman is the organizer of the exhibition and the author of its
                        illustrated catalogue. He has selected approximately two hundred works,
                        including a substantial number of the watercolor and tempera illustrations
                        to the Bible and the works of tempera illustrations to the Bible and the
                        works of Milton, Gray and Dante. One significant feature of the exhibition
                        will be the unique colored copy of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> The most
                        important of the "illuminated" books and individual color prints
                        will be represented by several copies in order to demonstrate the
                        development of Blake’s ideas throughout his working life.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">William Blake: His Art and Times</hi> will be the most
                        comprehensive exhibition of Blake’s work in North America in recent
                        years. It draws upon the extensive Blake holdings at Yale and in the
                        collection of Mr. Paul Mellon. The Tate Gallery and the British Museum are
                        foremost among foreign lenders. From Yale the exhibition will travel to the
                        Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto.</p>

          <p>Ruth Fine, formerly curator of Lessing J. Rosenwald’s Alverthorpe
                        Gallery and now curator in the Department of Graphic Arts at the National
                        Gallery of Art, Washington, D. C., has organized an exhibition in honor of
                        Rosenwald. <hi rend="i">Lessing J. Rosenwald: Tribute to a Collector</hi>
                        opens at the National Gallery 21 February and runs through 9 May 1982.</p>
          <p>With 100 works selected from the 22,000 pieces that Rosenwald collected
                        during his lifetime, the exhibition will represent the range of
                        Rosenwald’s interests in medieval manuscript illumination,
                        fifteenth-century woodcuts and engravings, Blake, the impressionists,
                        post-impressionists, and German expressionists, among others. Among the
                        Blakes in the exhibition is <hi rend="i">The Vision of Queen Katherine</hi>
                        (Butlin 549). A fully illustrated catalogue of the exhibition is
                        available.</p>

          <p>Perhaps because they are by nature or inclination themselves extremists,
                        Blake people seem equally undeterred by the earliness or lateness of their
                        appointed hour, as this past year’s two MLA Special Sessions
                        demonstrated. The Sunrise Semester Special, "Blake and the Art of His
                        Time," attracted a good crowd, whose members were treated to four
                        slide-illustrated presentations: Dennis Read on Blake’s
                        "Death’s Door," Alexander Gourlay and John Grant on a
                        possible Blake-Reynolds connection involving the latter’s portrait of
                        Anne Dashwood, Kevin Lewis on the apocalyptic and millennial in the art of
                        Blake’s contemporaries, and John Wright on Blake’s stereoptic
                        art and its relations to the popular art of the period. The Gourlay/Grant
                        paper, incidentally, has now been accepted for publication in the <hi rend="i">Bulletin of Research in the Humanities.</hi> All the
                        presentations, as well as the discussion that ensued, stressed the clear
                        need for further exploration of Blake’s ties with the visual milieu
                        of his times, a need that is at last being seriously addressed, as recent
                        publications on Blake’s work attest.</p>

          <p>To accompany the meeting of the Canadian Society for Eighteenth Century
                        Studies in Edmonton, there will be an exhibition of art works related to the
                        activities of William Hayley. The exhibition is organized by Victor Chan of
                        the Univ. of Alberta and will include approximately 150 paintings, drawings,
                        prints and books. These works—by William Blake, John Flaxman, George
                        Romney, Benjamin West, Henry Fuseli, Thomas Stothard, George Morland, James
                        Barry and John Mortimer—are drawn from Canadian and American
                        collectors. A Comprehensive catalogue will accompany the exhibition. In
                        addition, a workshop at the beginning of the Edmonton conference on
                        "Art in the Age of Sensibility and Revolution" will serve as an
                        introduction to the exhibition. For more information about the Edmonton
                        conference (14-16 October 1982) and participation in the workshop, contact

                        themselves will not be presented; rather, this textbook will serve as the

                        registration fee, anyone planning to attend is requested to send in his or
                        her address, together with a check for $8 (this sum to partially defray the
                        cost of duplication and postage), so that the organizers will know how many
                        copies to prepare and where to mail them when they become available in
                        mid-April. Checks should be made out to T. A. Vogler, Blake &amp;
