          <p>All in all, the first year of the new millennium (or the final year of the old, depending on one’s calendrical orientation) was a disappointing one for Blake collectors. A ray of hope, only to be dimmed within four days, emerged on 24 January. Alexander Gourlay alerted me to the appearance of a Blake drawing or print on the eBay online auction site. I will quote the description of this object in full, in part to give a sense of the quality of such descriptions on the internet: “William Blake Drawing, ‘Book of Job.’ William Blake Drawing/Print Purchased by Henry Melling, Esq in 1829. John Quinn, Esq purchased in 1935. Passed onto Albert and Victoria Museum, South Kensington. On loan to Liverpool Museum 1951 and 1952.” There was no indication of medium or size and no illustration, but the required starting bid of $40,000 caught my attention. I soon found that this work is described by Butlin under his #163, an early drawing related to the large Job engraving of 1793. Butlin there states that the Melling/Quinn work was last recorded in a Sotheby’s auction on 18 Nov. 1953, lot 122 (£45 to “Meadows,” apparently a dealer) and might “just possibly” be the same as the Job drawing (Butlin #163). Butlin then warns that the Melling/Quinn drawing, “now untraced, was unlikely, to judge by other works attributed to Blake from the Quinn collection, to have been genuine.” At the time Butlin wrote his catalogue, the genuine Job drawing was also untraced, but it turned up in London in 1989—see Martin Butlin, “Six Early Drawings by William Blake and a Reattribution,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 23 (1989): 107-12, illus. 7-8 (now private American collection). This rediscovery made it even less likely that the Melling/Quinn drawing was by Blake. But hope is rarely stilled in the hearts of collectors. I contracted the seller on eBay, who turned out be a wife and husband who inherited the work from her grandmother. They lived in the San Francisco area where, as luck would have it, I was planning a visit on 28 January. We made arrangements to meet at the airport.</p>
          <p>The owners arrived with cheerful greetings and a framed water color, the image approx. 13 × 19.5 cm. I knew on first sight that the work was not Blake’s, but studied and mused for a few minutes to ease into an assessment. Years ago, an owner of some prints from <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> had to be restrained from physically attacking me when I suggested that his treasures might be posthumous impressions. At least I was in a public place this time. The water color pictured a white horse running at breakneck speed over a field, with the vague outlines of lightning in the sky and a red sunset in the distance. An inscription on the mat indicated that the image was based on the description of a fierce horse in Job 39:19-25. As I slowly told the owners, the water color was far too loose in the handling of both outlines and washes to be by Blake. If I had to come up with an attribution, I would say “School of James Ward.” Frowns soon followed; the man took a quite understandable “who the hell are you to ruin my day?” attitude; the woman was more subdued and accepting. We parted on reasonably good terms, all parties sadder but perhaps a bit wiser. At least one more loose end in the pseudo-Blake cannon had been tied down. The drawing received no bids during its few days on eBay and was withdrawn.</p>
          <p>In mid-January I learned that Swann Galleries of New York was planning to sell an unrecorded Blake drawing of the Crucifixion in their 3 February auction. The catalogue arrived a few days before the sale. Anticipation turned to bewilderment as I gazed upon a color reproduction of what was indeed a picture of the Crucifixion, but one that looked more like a dog’s breakfast than a Blake. Why do people continue to attribute to Blake loosely constructed and miserably executed daubs of paint offering excellent examples of the blots and blurs Blake criticized in his writings on the arts? Perhaps the astute members of Swann’s Prints and Drawings Department, Todd Weyman, Sybil Rodgers, and Nigel Freeman, had some other “William Blake” in mind. Someone paid $4600 for the work, which would be a bargain for a Blake, but a high price for twaddle.</p>
          <p>In mid-March I was contacted by a collector who wanted my opinion of a painting he had acquired at a yard sale. He had taken his version of “Satan, Sin, and Death” to the popular TV program, “Antiques Roadshow,” where it had been attributed (he told me) to Blake by “an appraiser from Cristy’s [sic].” The digital images attached to his email message revealed what one might charitably call a primitive bit of nineteenth-century folk art featuring stick figures and murky coloring. Has Blake become the attribution-of-last-resort for any really ugly drawing or painting of a religious subject?</p>
          <p>Late March brought forth the exciting news that a manuscript dealer in Britain had (as I was told third hand) “a four page letter by Blake describing his painting.” With enthusiasm unchained, I leapt at the conclusion that this meant “painting technique.” Such a topic would make the letter unrecorded and a discovery of great scholarly value. Alas, the manuscript turned out to be one of the three known versions of Blake’s description of his <hi rend="i">Last Judgment</hi> painting, a well-known document that had appeared on the market twice before in recent years.</p>
          <p>The San Francisco auction house, Butterfield’s, offered in September a copy of Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>, 1805, with the plates hand colored. Fortunately, the book was exhibited in Los Angeles before the sale, and thus I was able to inspect it. I immediately thought that the coloring was very attractive, but unlikely to be by Blake. I should have looked more carefully.

Butlin #434. See comments in the introductory essay about the attempt to export this splendid work from Britain to the United States. David Bindman has suggested to me in private correspondence that the subject of this work is the creation of light, and thus it might be identifiable with Butlin #433, untraced since 1853. Morton Paley reminds me that Butlin records an inscription, lower right, citing Genesis 2:3 (“And God blessed the seventh day”); the creation of light is presented in Genesis 1:3. However, this biblical reference is on the mount, not on the work itself, and is not in Blake’s hand. Photo courtesy of a British private collector.</figDesc></figure><pb id="p34-102" n="102"/>
John Windle acquired the book, and I was able to study it more carefully in November. The tints and their handling are similar to what we can observe in the hand-colored impression of “Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims” in the Keynes Collection, Fitzwilliam Museum. The coloring of the sky in several of the <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> plates is particularly striking, and reminiscent of the autumnal tones in an impression of “Little Tom the Sailor” (American private collection) almost certainly colored by Blake. In the fifth and final <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> plate, “The Horse,” the noble creature is basically uncolored, and thus looks as white as he does in Blake’s tempera of the design (Butlin #366). Under low-power magnification, I could see that the horse did bear some slight tinting in gray, here and there on his neck and flank. This delicate work, lending subtle modeling rather than color, is hardly typical of commercial hand coloring. It now seems to me that there is a good chance that the coloring of this copy is by Blake or Mrs. Blake. If only I had come to this conclusion on first sight. Windle has also discovered circumstantial evidence that this may be the copy once in the collection of S. Foster Damon and described in Bentley 571, as “coloured . . . by Blake” in the “opinion of the owner and Sir Geoffrey Keynes.”</p>
          <p>The most exciting Blake sale (or, rather, attempted sale) of the year came to my attention in the fall. A London dealer applied for a license to export <hi rend="i">God Blessing the Seventh Day</hi> (Butlin #434; see illus. 1) for sale in the United States. This work, formerly in the W. Graham Robertson and George Goyder collections and since 1962 in a British private collection, is the finest Blake painting or water color still in private hands. Unlike so many of Blake’s biblical pictures, <hi rend="i">God Blessing</hi> is in excellent, unfaded condition, the colors still luminous. The Export Reviewing Committee refused the license on 10 October, thereby allowing a British buyer to acquire the work by matching the sale price of £650,000 within three months, with an option for a three-month extension. If no such buyer comes forward, then the license will almost certainly be granted. An article about the export ban by Dalya Alberge appeared in the 25 October online version of the London <hi rend="i">Times.</hi> According to Alberge, Tate Britain tried to borrow the water color for its Blake exhibition, 9 Nov. 2000 to 11 Feb. 2001, but was turned down. It would not be in the dealer’s own interests to display the work where it might attract financial support for efforts to keep it in Britain. Like several other Blake enthusiasts, I hope that a British institution, such as the Tate, will be able to raise the funds to acquire, preserve, and occasionally exhibit <hi rend="i">God Blessing the Seventh Day.</hi></p>
          <p>John Windle’s cat. 31, handsomely printed by the Stinehour Press and devoted exclusively to Blake and his circle, appeared in January. Since the online version was available in November 1999, I reported all relevant items in the last sales review. They are not repeated here. I have, however, listed several new items from Windle’s stock, including a book that might have been owned by Blake (see illus. 2 and its caption) and some nineteenth-century facsimiles of Blake’s illuminated books that are now commanding high prices—see the entries under “Interesting Blakeana,” below. The paucity of originals on the market, and their extraordinary prices when they do appear, have been a stimulus to collecting early facsimiles.</p>
          <p>Beginning with my 1990 sales review, published in the spring 1991 issue of this journal, I have been appending revisions to two catalogues I authored, <hi rend="i">The Separate Plates of William Blake</hi> (1983) and <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations</hi> (1991). I am now adding, as an on-going member of the group, substantive revisions to Roger R. Easson and Robert N. Essick, <hi rend="i">William Blake: Book Illustrator</hi>, vol. 1, Plates Designed and Engraved by Blake (Normal, Illinois: The American Blake Foundation, 1972). Only information on Blake’s prints themselves, not the bibliographic information on the volumes in which they appear, will be supplemented. See Appendix 1, below, for more information.</p>
          <p>The slow accretion of catalogues of Blake’s prints has led to some confusion about what genres are covered in which volumes. Volume 1 of Easson and Essick, as the subtitle indicates, is devoted exclusively to commercially produced letterpress books containing plates designed and engraved by Blake. Volume 2 of Easson and Essick, published in 1979, covers books containing plates engraved by Blake after designs by other artists <hi rend="i">and</hi> books with plates engraved by other craftsmen after designs by Blake. That volume conduded its chronological survey in 1796; the projected but never published volume 3 of Easson and Essick was intended to follow the same two categories from 1797 to the end of Blake’s career. <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations</hi> does not consider the materials in Easson and Essick volume 1. It substantially replaces Easson and Essick volume 2, and fulfills the role intended for volume 3, but only in the single category of plates engraved by Blake after designs by other artists. Further, Easson and Essick volume 2 contains a great deal of bibliographic information (supplied by Easson), and even some information about and reproductions of Blake’s possible apprentice engravings, not covered in <hi rend="i">Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations.</hi></p>
          <p>Readers with the patience to follow the twists and turns of the previous paragraph will realize that one genre has been left unattended—books with plates designed by Blake but engraved by another craftsman. Only one title falling into that genre appears in Easson and Essick volume 2; works published after 1796 have never been reproduced and catalogued in the manner established by Easson and Essick or <hi rend="i">Blake’s Commercial Books Illustrations.</hi> Thankfully, the list of titles of this sort is not long, and thus I have added, as Appendix 2 to this sales review, a somewhat makeshift and abbreviated (but I hope useful) handlist of letterpress books containing plates designed but not engraved by Blake. See Appendix 2 for further caveats and directives.</p>

          <p>The year of all sales and catalogues in the following lists is 2000 unless indicated otherwise. The auction houses add their purchaser’s surcharge to the hammer price in their price lists. These net amounts are given here, following the official price lists. The value-added tax levied against the buyer’s surcharge in Britain is not included. Late 2000 sales will be covered in the 2001 review. The coverage of online catalogues is selective and excludes sites (e.g., Alibris) which do not list dealers’ names. I am grateful for help in compiling this review to David Bindman, Richard Godfrey, Alexander Gourlay, Donald Heald, Jenijoy La Belle, Tim Linnell, Edward Maggs, and John Windle. Once again, John Sullivan’s electronic imaging and Patricia Neill’s careful editing have been invaluable.</p>

            <p>“Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims.” Butterfield &amp; Butterfield auction, San Francisco, 20 April, #1084, 5th st., said to be a “Sessler printing on wove paper” but actually on laid India (according to John Windle) and thus almost certainly a Colnaghi impression, marginal tears and some paper loss outside the image, paper evenly stained brown (not sold; estimate $2000-3000). eBay online auction, late June, 5th st., no information on paper type or printing, framed to image top and both sides, illus. showing staining and wrinkling ($2000). Mallams auction, Cheltenham, England, 6 Oct., #461, 5th st. on thin, hard laid paper, considerable ink tone printed from the surface of the plate, showing the scratched letter inscriptions of the title and the inadvertent scratches in the image that indicate an early impression of this st. (pre-Colnaghi or a Colnaghi first printing?), framed (£4485 to J. Windle for stock on an estimate of £2500-3000). eBay online auction, early Oct., 5th st. on laid India and thus almost certainly a Colnaghi impression, good condition (withdrawn by the vendor, who wanted to do more research before attempting to sell the print); same impression, eBay online auction, mid-Oct., illus. ($4300 to J. Windle for stock). SL, 6 Dec., #7, “second state” (actually the 3rd st.), Essick impression 3W from the collection of Johan Stray, Oslo, on wove paper, marginal tears, foxing and light staining, “other defects,” illus. (£5760).</p>

2 on wove paper without watermark, 1 more darkly printed on wove paper with a “J Whatman 1886” watermark, 2 with inscriptions by E. J. Shaw, who acquired the copperplate in 1903 and very probably had these impressions pulled (prices on application).</p>
            <p>Dante engravings. Lame Duck Books, Dec. 1999 cat. 46, #24, complete set, probably the 1892 printing, printed label laid in, loose in morocco portfolio ($35,000).</p>
            <p>“The Fall of Rosamond,” Blake after Stothard. eBay online auction, March-April, 2nd st., printed in black on laid paper, trimmed to a rectangle, 31.2 × 29.5 cm., cutting slightly into the border at the top and on both sides and cutting off the imprint and all but a fragment of the inscribed verses, surface dirt and some staining, illus. with the sides of the image cut off by the narrow width of the scanner (a great bargain at $49.99 to Alexander Gourlay). The above description is based on the illus. and information supplied by Gourlay; the vendor gave no online description.</p>

Ps. Schl. upon an equality with the boy, to whom the prize of his class was adjudged. May - 1826 [last digit unclear].” The gilt-stamped title (“Thornton’s Pastorals of Virgil”) and “Pocket Edition” on the spines of

this binding are identical to those found on copies in the publisher’s original sheep. In the Finch/Schiller copy, the same words are differently placed and the accompanying decorations are more elaborate. These presentation bindings may have been produced by the publishers for St. Paul’s School; such copies were then used by the school as student prizes. Alternatively, the school was supplied with unbound copies in sheets; but if this was the scenario then the school used the same binder as the publisher, as indicated by the identical letter forms on the spines.

Osborn and T. Longman, 1733.</head><figDesc>Inscribed “William Blake / his Book” in brown ink. In January 2001 in the stock of the San Francisco book dealer John Windle; reproduced with his permission. The signature bears some resemblance to the “William Blake” signatures on the title page of a copy of <hi rend="i">A Political and Satirical History of the Years 1755 and 1757</hi> now in the collection of Michael Phillips; see the reproduction in G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1995) pl. 12. The “stroking” of the letters—that is, the direction in which the pen was moved to form each letter—is the same in these examples, although the “W” of “William” differs noticeably in basic shape. The distance between the forename and family name, with printed text intervening, is similar on both title pages. <hi rend="i">A Political and Satirical History</hi> bears the date 1773, written in the same, rather awkward hand as the signatures. The signature in the <hi rend="i">Pharmacopoia</hi> is also probably of an early date—if indeed by our William Blake. But his ownership of <hi rend="i">A Political and Satirical History</hi> is far from certain, and thus it offers less than a solid touchstone. A more resilient comparison is offered by the last leaf in the <hi rend="i">Island in the Moon</hi> manuscript of c. 1784; see the reproduction in <hi rend="i">William Blake: Catalogue of the Collection in the Fitzwilliam Museum</hi>, ed. David Bindman (Cambridge: Heffer, 1970) pl. 7. The shape of the “W” is similar in these examples, but the stroking of the “B” of “Blake” is quite different, begun with a small loop at the top of a single vertical in the <hi rend="i">Pharmacopoia</hi>, but begun at the top and carried through to the bottom, thereby creating a double-line vertical, in the <hi rend="i">Island</hi> manuscript. The most that I can conclude from these comparisons is that the newly discovered volume might have been owned by the poet/artist.<lb/><lb/>
Windle has pointed out to me that a remedy for itchy skin diseases is underlined in his copy of the <hi rend="i">Pharmacopoia.</hi> A letter from Ozias Humphry of 15 June 1806 to “D[ea]r William” refers to the recipient as having “Erisipilas,” a skin disease (see BR 178). But here again, the touchstone is less than certain. The mode of address in the salutation and much else in Humphry’s letter suggests a familiarity inconsistent with what we know of the patron/artist relationship between Humphry and Blake in the 1790s. Humphry’s letter refers to “Lord Melvilles tryal,” suggesting that the recipient may have been the lawyer William Blake, active c. 1806. G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Records Supplement</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1988) 48n4, states that it “seems likely” that Humphry’s letter “has nothing to do with William Blake [the poet and artist].”</figDesc></figure>

The NPG head is second generation—that is, cast from a mold made from the Deville casting in the NPG. The eBay head is almost certainly third generation—that is, cast from a mold made from one of the NPG copies. The vendor (located in California) on eBay would end the auction as soon as anyone bid the minimum price, and then almost immediately offer another example, thereby converting an online auction site into a retail outlet. I suspect that the vendor may also be the producer of these heads. Another vendor, located in Australia, also offered casts of Blake’s life mask on eBay in the fall.</p>

Includes the “Introduction” to <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> and “The Tyger.” The latter exhibits the following substantive variants: line 6, “Burnt the ardour of thine eyes?”; line 12, “What dread hand form’d thy dread feet?” (as in Blake’s manuscript revision in copy P of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>); line 15, “Did God smile his work to see?” The ownership of copy P is not known for the mid-nineteenth century period; the revisions in lines 6 and 15 are probably just Allingham’s “improvements.”</p>

              <p>Stothard, portrait of, standing in his studio. Artist unknown. Oil, framed to 89 × 69 cm., dated to c. 1800. Roy Davids, March cat. for “The Artist as a Portrait” exhibition and sale (3-14 April) at the Fine Art Society, London, #156, illus. color (£12,500). A large painting of an illus. Stothard designed for W. L. Bowles, <hi rend="i">Sonnets and Other Poems</hi> (1801), rests on an easel behind the figure; a free version of Titian’s <hi rend="i">Venus and Adonis</hi> hangs on the back wall of the studio. The design for Bowles would seem to be the best reason for identifying the subject as Stothard. He resembles other portraits of Stothard, but looks impossibly young for a man of 45 years. I remain skeptical.</p>

Easson and Essick lists three states of pls. 1 and 2 and only two states for pls. 3-6, but a total of three states exist for all 6 plates. We now know that the “A” and “B” states of pls. 3-6 in Easson and Essick are actually the second and third states. The true first states of pls. 3-6 are described and reproduced in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 24 (1991): 130-31. A copy with all pls. in their first states, formerly in the collection of Sir Geoffrey Keynes, is now in the RNE collection. A copy with the pls. hand colored is in the Library of Congress. I do not believe that the somber and rather amateurish tinting is by Blake.</p>

            <p>Pp. 13-28, Edward Young, <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, 1797. All the preliminary water color drawings are catalogued in Butlin #330. Easson and Essick could not obtain permission to describe the 24 impressions, some in pre-publication proof states, then in the collection of Philip Hofer and now in the Houghton Library, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. These are described, plate by plate, below. The list also includes additions to (and a few corrections of) the Easson and Essick descriptions of the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> proofs Blake used in his <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript. The water colors, the Houghton proofs, and most of the proofs in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> (pls. 10, 28-29, 31-32, 36, and 42 are lacking) are reproduced in <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Designs for Edward Young’s</hi> Night Thoughts: <hi rend="i">A Complete Edition</hi>, ed. John E. Grant, Edward J. Rose, and Michael J. Tolley, “co-ordinating editor” David V. Erdman (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1980), 2 vols. This work also includes a catalogue of states of the plates (1: 17-35) and a census of copies of the book with the engravings hand colored. For additional hand-colored copies, see G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1995) 271-73, and Bentley’s annual checklists published in this journal.</p>
            <p>Pl. 1, fly-title to “Night the First.” The Houghton proof lacks all the background shading and much of the shading and details on the figures. The hands of the angels at the top of the plate are extended to the right rather than turned downward, palms up, as in all later states. The thumbs on both hands of the figure top right are close to their palms and other fingers, rather than separated from the rest of the hand. The fingers of the left hand of the woman with a distaff are pictured (covered by the giant bearded figure’s leg in all later states). The bearded figure’s foot and the folds of drapery just above it are differently configured. A few lines indicate his mouth, or at least hairs of his beard around the mouth; these lines are eliminated in later states. The faces of the woman and the other small figures gathered around her are altered, in expression and shading, in later states. The engraved title has not yet been engraved but is written in pencil. Transparent brown wash covers the face, hand, and knee of the large bearded figure (see Butlin #330A.1). Another impression in the Houghton group is in the published state. The lightly inked impression in the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript, described by Easson and Essick as being in the published state, lacks a few lines in the hair of the woman holding a distaff, some hatching on the lower left folds of her gown, and on the gown of the girl immediately to the left, whose face is hidden by the outstretched arms of a boy presenting a curved object (a manuscript?) to the woman.</p>
            <p>Pl. 2, <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> p. 1. The impression in the Houghton group is in the published state.</p>
            <p>Pl. 3, p. 4. Grant, Rose, and Tolley, 1:18, infer a first state containing an extra branch arching above the head of the figure walking in the wood, left of the text panel. This branch is partly erased, but its location is still indicated, in both the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> proof and the published state. There is no known impression of this conjectural first state, but the reasoning that suggests its existence is plausible.</p>
            <p>Pl. 4, p. 7. The proof used for p. 53 in the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript is in a later state than the proof used for p. 71. The later state shows additional crosshatching on the base (a table?) supporting the hourglass and other objects, on the blanket or cloak covering the lower body of the foreground figure, and on and inside the bell (lower right) held by the bearded figure. There is additional hatching on the bedding below the foreground figure’s stomach (immediately right of the end of the blanket), on the area (a pillow?) below the bell, and on the right leg above the knee of the bearded figure. The shadow cutting diagonally above the bearded figure in the published state is still lacking.</p>
            <p>Pl. 6, p. 10. The impression in the Houghton group lacks the imprint but is otherwise as in the published state.</p>
            <p>Pl. 7, p. 12. The proof used as p. 49 of the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript shows the ghostly image of the birds, including the largest one, left of the text panel. Either this area of the plate still lacked some finishing strokes on the birds or was poorly inked. The impression in the Houghton group is in the published state (area of the imprint trimmed off). A copy of the book I saw in June 1996, then in the possession of the London dealer Sims Reed, confirms the presence of the imprint in the published state.</p>
            <p>Pl. 10, p. 16. In addition to the absent work noted in Easson and Essick, the figure lacks some lines in his hair in the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> proof. The impression in the Houghton group lacks only the imprint.</p>
            <p>Pl. 11, p. [17], fly-title to “Night the Second.” There are two proofs in the Houghton group. The earliest shows the figures in outline with some interior modeling and only slight patches of shading. The clouds and foreground indications of earth or grass are absent. The small figure on the left, standing in the lap of the large winged figure, has female breasts. The small figure on the right has one finger of his left hand (the hand grasped by his companion) extended downward. The engraved text is absent, but the text panel bears, in pencil, a text of three lines (“TIME / DEATH / FRIENDSH”), rules below each line, and (below) a slight sketch of two figures, the one on the right holding a dart or arrow, and an hourglass (see Butlin #330A.2). The second Houghton proof lacks the engraved text. The clouds and foreground shading have been added, as well as many lines of interior modeling and shading. Additional shading on the small figure on the left enlarges and highlights the figure’s female breasts; the figure’s belly is now rounded and distended, as if pregnant. This figure now appears even more androgynous than in the first proof state. The first published state (illus. 4), present in one impression in the Houghton group and in roughly 20% of the copies of the book I have seen, slightly reduces the prominence of the breasts of the small figure on the left, mostly by eliminating a few lines of shading on the
<pb id="p34-122" n="122"/>
upper reaches of each breast. The beard of the giant figure holding a dart has been modified in the area of the mouth, as though the hair now is slightly parted around the mouth. In the second (final) published state, this area of his beard has been returned to its appearance in the second proof state (i.e., no parting of the hair around the mouth). A good deal of hatching has been added to the design in this final state, particularly on the giant wings above the winged figures head, on the drapery or wing(?) just beneath the text panel, on the ground lower left and right, and on the cloud above the winged figure’s head. The breasts of the small figure on the left have been reduced in roundness and prominence; the belly now appears to be less distended. The drapery just left of his stomach has been eliminated. Hatching has been added to the drapery falling over and to the left of his legs. This figure now appears to be less androgynous and more masculine in body configuration; the face has also been slightly modified in expression. The pointing finger on the left hand of the small figure on the right has been eliminated. The two figures are now holding hands rather than the figure on the left grasping the wrist of the figure on the right.</p>
            <p>Pl. 12, p. 19. The proof in the Houghton group lacks the imprint but is otherwise as in the published state.</p>
            <p>Pl. 13, p. 23. The very early proof in the Houghton group lacks a good deal of interior modeling and most of the shading. A bird, perhaps an owl, with stylized wings sits on the top of the text panel. The infant has his back to us and the woman’s face is in profile. Another impression in the Houghton group is the lower half of the plate only, the top half having been cut away. At least this lower part of the plate is in the published state, in which the infant has been turned so that he faces up rather than inward. His arms now extend to the left as though he were reaching in that direction. The woman’s face is now seen in three-quarter view and more of her hair is revealed above her forehead. The man’s right thumb has been straightened and lengthened. The bird above the text panel has been changed into an angel with head bent over on its prominent knees, as in the water color.</p>
            <p>Pl. 14, p. 24. The first proof state in the Houghton group lacks some of the shading on the figure holding the sickle, most of the shading on the ground below, and all of the background shading. In the next proof state, used for p. 99 of the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript, most of the shading found in the published state has been added. The big toe on the right foot of the giant figure has been slightly altered in a light pencil sketch to the right of this toe. The sketch was very probably made by Blake while proofing the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> plates and before using this impression in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> The published state includes slight modifications to the toe, although it is difficult to determine if these follow the sketch. The figure leaning on the hourglass above the text panel has been modified in several ways. The figure’s lower body has been turned more toward the viewer, her(?) long hair now falls over the top left corner of the hourglass, and her leg positions have been changed. See Easson and Essick for further modification to the giant figure.</p>
            <p>Pl. 15, p. 25. The differences among the impression in the Houghton group, the impression used for p. 127 of the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript, and the published state can be accounted for by differences in inking.</p>
            <p>Pl. 16, p. 26. The first proof state used for p. 135 of the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript lacks the monogram. The hair of the woman holding an infant, lower left, arches higher on her head than in the published state; see Easson and Essick for further differences. The second proof state in the Houghton group retains the imprint of the earlier state. This second proof state lacks only some shading on the giant figure’s hand and fingers.</p>
            <p>Pl. 18, p. 31. The proof in the Houghton group lacks shading on the large seated figure’s face. The faces of the small figure standing before the large figure, and the face of the small figure hovering just above the seated one, also lack a bit of shading. The figure hovering below the text panel, arms outstretched, has bare legs with a tail of drapery fluttering between them. The drapery has been extended, and covers at least the left leg, in the published state.</p>
            <p>Pl. 19, p. 33. The proof in the Houghton group is in an earlier state than the proof used for p. 51 in the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript. The imprint has not yet been engraved. The face of the figure on the right is darkened with a stronger expression of fear. His hair is darkly cross-hatched above his forehead (lightened in both later states) and the little finger on his right hand is less tightly curled toward the palm. The cloud forms on the right have a different outline and both figures lack a good deal of shading.</p>
            <p>Pl. 20, p. 35. The proof in the Houghton group is in an earlier state than the proof used for p. 95 in the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript. The monogram and imprint have not yet been engraved. The features of all the figures are in a rudimentary state of development and thus their expressions are slightly different. The dark background crosshatching on the right has not been executed and the figures lack a good deal of shading. In addition to the work missing in the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> proof already noted by Easson and Essick, the state lacks the crossing strokes in the crosshatched shadow just to the left of the boy standing at the knee of the seated woman on the right. The right hand of the harper above the text panel appears only in the published state.</p>
            <p>Pl. 25, p. 46. The proof in the Houghton group lacks the imprint but is in other respects the same as the published state.</p>
            <p>Pl. 26, p. 49. Easson and Essick state that the monogram is lacking in the proof before imprint used as p. 47 in the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript, but there do appear to be a few scratched indications of the monogram. Apparent differences in hatching patterns (e.g., on the horses’ legs) may be due to light inking.</p>
            <p>Pl. 27, p. 54. In addition to the work lacking from the proof (<hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, p. 83) described by Easson and
<pb id="p34-123" n="123"/>
Essick, the dress strap or neckline on the swimming woman with arms outstretched is also absent.</p>
            <p>Pl. 31, fly-title to “The Christian Triumph.” The first proof state in the Houghton group, in comparison to the second proof state used in the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript (p. 114), lacks the monogram, many lines in the rising figure’s hair and shading on his body, and some shading on the faces of the kneeling angels. Many lines were added to the hair of the angel on the right in the second proof state.</p>
            <p>Pl. 32, p. 70. The first proof state in the Houghton group lacks shading in the clouds upper left, the vertical lines defining the teeth of the figure holding a spear, some lines defining his right eyebrow, a few lines between the bridge of his nose and his left eye, and some shading on his neck below his ear.</p>
            <p>Pl. 33, p. 72. The first proof state in the Houghton group lacks the mushroom-shaped form at the very top of the arch, upper left, some lines in the woman’s hair, the shading on the curled fingers of her male companion’s left hand, and considerable shading and modeling on the hands, face, and lower right leg of the man lower right. His hair lacks many of the lines found in the second proof state (<hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, p. 67). The standing man’s stomach has been redefined with softer interior modeling in this second proof state and his navel is much less prominent; it has been eliminated completely in the published state. If this is Adam, as seems likely, the removal of the navel befits his unusual nativity. The lines defining the bottom and right side of the text panel do not extend to the man’s head, lower right, in either proof state.</p>
            <p>Pl. 34, p. 73. The impression in the Houghton group is in the published state. The proof used for p. 59 of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> is intermediate between the other <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> proofs, p. 111 of the manuscript (first proof state) and p. 115 (third proof state). The figure’s mouth in this second proof state is narrower, with the lips less full in the middle of the mouth, than in the third proof state and in the published state. There might also be some differences in the lines defining the moustache and beard close to the mouth, but these may be only the result of light inking.</p>
            <p>Pl. 37, p. 86. The text panel in the two <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> proof states is less in height, not in “width” (Easson and Essick), than in the published state. In the second proof state, <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript p. 119, the outline of the foot beneath the text panel has been redrawn in pencil and then partly erased. This foot does not appear in the published state.</p>
            <p>Pl. 39, p. 88. The proof in the Houghton group lacks the imprint but is otherwise the same as the published state.</p>
            <p>Pl. 40, p. 90. The proof used for p. 97 of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> is in a slightly later state than the proof used for p. 45 of the manuscript. In this second proof state, crosshatching strokes have been added to the stippled lines of shading along the lower edge of the right thigh of the seated figure. Similar crossing strokes have been added to his right upper arm.</p>
            <p>Pl. 43, p. 95. In addition to the work absent from the proof state in the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript, p. 109, as described by

Rothwell, 1827. At the time of writing, I had not seen a copy of the book. James McCord has kindly supplied me with xeroxes of the plates from a copy of the book once in the collection of Greville MacDonald and bearing his distinctive “Death’s Door” bookplate. In my opinion, the rather simple and crude plates in this edition of Goldsmith’s <hi rend="i">History</hi> are not by Blake. Blake may have produced somewhat similar plates in the 1780s and early 1790s, but not in the 1820s.</p>

Books which contain plates copied after Blake’s previously published designs are noted here, but not described in detail, if published before his death in 1827. Later engravings of Blake’s images are not listed (e.g., William J. Linton’s wood engravings of “Death’s Door” and William Bell Scott’s etchings of Blake’s drawings and paintings).</p>

The pencil drawing for pl. 3 (now Keynes Collection, Fitzwilliam Museum) is catalogued in Butlin #339. For published reviews that criticize Blake’s designs, see BR 54-55.</p>
            <p>II. Marie Vollstonecraft [sic] Godwin, <hi rend="i">Marie et Caroline</hi> (Paris: Dentu, 1799). The 5 unsigned plates in this French translation of Wollstonecraft’s <hi rend="i">Original Stories from Real Life</hi> were very probably based on Blake’s pls. 2-6 in the London eds. of 1791 and 1796, not on the original drawings. See G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1995) 265, 268-69; for discussion and reproductions, see Bentley, “Marie Vollstonecraft Godwin and William Blake in France: The First Foreign Engravings after Blake’s Designs,” <hi rend="i">Australian Journal of French Studies</hi> 26 (1989): 125-47.</p>
            <p>III. William Hayley, <hi rend="i">The Life and Posthumous Writings of William Cowper</hi> (New York: T. and J. Swords, 1803). This American edition includes a wood engraving by Alexander Anderson of the “Weather-house” and “Cowper’s Tame Hares.” This print was probably copied after the engraving by Blake, based on his own design, in the 1803-04 London edition of the work (see Essick, <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations</hi> 88-89). For a reproduction of Anderson’s wood engraving, see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 30 (1997): 115.</p>
            <p>IV. Benjamin Heath Malkin, <hi rend="i">A Father’s Memoirs of His Child</hi> (London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, 1806). One plate was designed by Blake and engraved by Robert H. Cromek.</p>
            <p>1. Frontispiece facing the title page, 19.7 × 13.1 cm.; illus. 5-6.</p>

            <p>The design represents the death of the author’s young son, Thomas Williams Malkin, as a journey from his earthly mother to heaven with the assistance of a winged angel. The instruments on the ground, lower right, indicate Thomas’s precocious skills as a writer and artist. The medallion portrait in the center of the plate was “painted by Paye, when Thomas was not quite two years old” (Malkin xliv). Archibald G. B. Russell, <hi rend="i">The Engravings of William Blake</hi> (London: Grant Richards, 1912) 124n1, suggests that the artist was “Miss Paye,” a miniature portraitist active 1798-1807, rather than her father, the better-known artist Richard Morton Paye, apparently inactive after c. 1802. Blake originally engraved the design (including the portrait) himself, the unique impression of which is in the British Museum, Dept. of Prints and Drawings. Since the portrait is identical in both Blake’s version and Cromek’s, the same

copperplate must have been used for both engravings, the work of the former scraped and burnished away to make room for the latter. The reasons for this substitution are unknown. The discovery of Blake’s plate, and much important information about its development, were first published in Dennis M. Read, “A New Blake Engraving: Gilchrist and the Cromek Connection,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 14 (1980): 60-64, with Blake’s version reproduced. According to Thomas Cromek, R. H. Cromek’s son, the medallion portrait was engraved by neither Blake nor Cromek, but by Robert Cooper, whose signature supposedly appeared on a now-untraced proof of the plate (see Read 61). For Blake’s version, see also Essick 244-45.</p>
            <p>A pencil sketch of an alternative version of Blake’s design is in the British Museum, Dept. of Prints and Drawings; see Butlin #580. Butlin #581, an untraced design showing “the Death of an Infant,” may be related to the plate. The pencil sketches of a child’s head and arms on the verso of <hi rend="i">War Unchained</hi> (Essick collection, Butlin #186) may also be related. Two of these are (coincidentally?) similar to Paye’s portrait of young Thomas, and at least one sketch looks like the child’s face and arms in Blake’s framing design.</p>
            <p>There are two extant pre-publication proof states of the plate as engraved by Cromek. In the first, the framing figures of Blake’s design have been etched, but much work is lacking, including the horizontal background hatching and the rays of light in the top portion of the image. Impressions are in the Essick collection (illus. 5) and in the British Museum, Dept. of Prints and Drawings (reproduced in David Bindman, <hi rend="i">The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake</hi> [London: Thames and Hudson, 1978], pl. 410). The fact that the medallion portrait is also unfinished, as it is in Blake’s rendition of the plate, makes one

suspicious that Cromek added to this image, even if originally engraved by Cooper. In the second proof state, both the framing design and the portrait medallion are completed, but the letters have yet to be added. Impressions are in the Essick collection (illus. 6) and the Huntington Library, San Marino, California.</p>

Bibliographic details, a catalogue of all states of the plates engraved by Luigi Schiavonetti after Blake’s designs, and reproductions of the plates and many related drawings are presented in Robert N. Essick and Morton D. Paley, <hi rend="i">Robert Blair’s</hi> The Grave <hi rend="i">Illustrated by William Blake: A Study with Facsimile</hi> (1982). <hi rend="i">Churchyard Spectres Frightening a Schoolboy</hi>, a preliminary water color for a design never engraved (Essick and Paley p. 74 and pl. 22; Butlin #342), is now in the Essick collection; for discussion and reproduction, see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 33 (2000): 106-08.</p>
            <p>There are three issues of an American edition containing Blake’s illustrations: Robert Blair, <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> (New York: A. L. Dick, 1847; New York: Stanford &amp; Delisser, 1858; New York, James Miller, n.d. [c. 1879]). These all contain engravings by A. L. Dick of Blake’s designs (except for pl. 3, “The Meeting of a Family in Heaven”) first published in the 1808 London edition. Dick almost certainly based his plates on Schiavonetti’s published engravings, not on Blake’s original drawings.</p>
            <p>VI. John Whitaker, <hi rend="i">The Seraph, A Collection of Sacred Music</hi>, 2 vols. (London: printed by Button, Whitaker, and Company, c. 1818-28; London: printed by Jones &amp; Co., c. 1825-28). The engraved title page in vol. 2 was executed by “P. Jones” (about whom nothing is known) after Blake’s illustration on p. 27 of Edward Young, <hi rend="i">The Complaint, and the Consolation; or, Night Thoughts</hi> (London: R. Edwards, 1797). Jones’ engraving was almost certainly based on Blake’s published engraving, not on his water color; see illus. 7.</p>
            <p>VII. <hi rend="i">The Pastorals of Virgil, with a Course of English Reading, Adapted for Schools</hi> . . . by Robert John Thornton (2 vols., 3rd ed., London: F. C. &amp; J. Rivingtons, et al., 1821). Vol. 1 contains 20 wood engravings designed by Blake. Seventeen were also executed by Blake, but three were cut by an anonymous journeyman and printed together on a single leaf—see illus. 8. The accompanying texts are set in letterpress and are not part of the woodblocks themselves.</p>
            <p>1. Uncounted page facing p. 17 in vol. 1, top image, 3.2 × 7.4 cm. Blake’s preliminary wash drawing was last recorded in the collection of Philip Hofer but has been untraced since 1939 (Butlin #769.14).</p>
            <p>2. Uncounted page facing p. 17 in vol. 1, middle image, 3.3 × 7.4 cm. Blake’s preliminary wash drawing is in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York (Butlin #769.15).</p>
            <p>3. Uncounted page facing p. 17 in vol. 1, bottom image, 3 × 7.5 cm. Blake’s preliminary wash drawing was last recorded in the collection of Philip Mallory but has been untraced since 1927 (Butlin #769.15).</p>
            <p>The designs are all based on phrases printed on p. 17: “thy flock to feed” and possibly “lightsome birds forget to fly” (top image), “the briny ocean” (middle image), and “every rapid river” (bottom image). Blake also is credited (<hi rend="i">Blake, del.</hi>) as having delineated the design in vol. 2, facing p. 21, engraved in wood by John Byfield (<hi rend="i">Byfield, sculp.</hi>). However, Blake’s untraced drawing was not of his own design but merely a copy of a painting by Nicolas Poussin, now in the Hermitage, St. Petersburg, Russia. The letterpress caption beneath the wood engraving reads “The Giant Polypheme, from a Famous Picture by N. Poussin.”</p>
            <pb id="p34-128" n="128"/>
            <p>VIII. John Varley, <hi rend="i">A Treatise on Zodiacal Physiognomy; Illustrated by Engravings of Heads and Features</hi> (London: The Author, 1828). Varley’s attempt to combine the pseudosciences of astrology and physiognomy contains six plates, five signed by John Linnell as the engraver and one unsigned. Although signed <hi rend="i">J. Varley. inv.</hi>, three plates contain images based on Blake’s designs.</p>
            <p>1. Variously bound facing p. 51 or as the third plate at the end of the pamphlet, 13.3 × 23 cm.; illus. 9.</p>
            <p>Signatures: <hi rend="i">J. Linnell sc.</hi> [left], <hi rend="i">J. Varley. inv.</hi> [right]</p>
            <p>Inscriptions beneath the heads: see illus. 9.</p>
            <p>The head labeled “Cancer” (second from the lower left corner) is related to Blake’s pencil sketch now in the Essick collection (Butlin #692c). Varley’s text makes passing references to Cancer as one of the zodiacal signs, but it offers no explicit description of this head. A tracing (Butlin #751), probably by Linnell or Varley and also in the Essick collection, may have played a role in the preparation of the plate. W. M. Rossetti was the first to suggest that the profile is a modified version of Blake’s own; see Rossetti’s catalogue in Alexander Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi> (London: Macmillan, 1863) 2: 245, no. 57. See also Geoffrey Keynes, <hi rend="i">The Complete Portraiture of William &amp; Catherine Blake</hi> (London: Trianon Press for the Blake Trust, 1977) 129-30, 143-44. Keynes suggests that Blake’s drawing was “instigated” by the “very mild view of Blake’s face” (144) in this plate, although any such instigation must have been based on a drawing by Varley or Linnell preliminary to the plate, not on the plate itself unless it was executed long before its publication. Butlin #692c states that, quite to the contrary, Blake’s drawing was the “original” of the plate, “reduced in scale and presumably reworked by Varley.” Another plate, almost certainly intended for a later installment of Varley’s publication that never appeared, includes a version of the “Cancer” profile much closer to Blake’s drawing; see Essick 246-47.</p>
            <p>Bentley 625 suggests that the profile of “Gemini” (lower right corner) is “evidently after the head” Blake sketched in pencil on p. 80 (private collection, Great Britain) of the now-dispersed Smaller Blake-Varley Sketchbook (Butlin #692.80, there titled <hi rend="i">A Girl in Profile, Perhaps Corinna</hi>). A similar but larger pencil drawing was last recorded in the possession of Maggs Bros., London, in Sept. 1949, but is now untraced (Butlin #709). There are significant similarities among the drawings and the engraved profile, but the differences indicate that Linnell or Varley altered the image when executing the plate. Varley devotes pp. 50-55 of his pamphlet to “Gemini.” There are no direct references to this profile, but at least one of the physiognomic descriptions later in the volume may be relevant: “Such persons have very often a large high nose, a retreating mouth, and projecting chin” (58).</p>
            <p>2. Variously bound as a frontispiece or as the fourth plate at the end of the pamphlet; 11 × 19.4 cm.; illus. 10 (second state).</p>
            <p>Signatures: <hi rend="i">J. Linnell sc.</hi> [left], <hi rend="i">J. Varley. inv.</hi> [right]</p>
            <p>Inscriptions beneath the heads: <hi rend="i">Gemini</hi> [left], <hi rend="i">Cancer</hi> [center], <hi rend="i">Ghost of a Flea. / from Blakes, vision.</hi> [right]</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">Second State.</hi> An additional inscription, <hi rend="i">See Page 54</hi>, has been added below the “Ghost of a Flea” (see illus. 10). In my experience, the second state is the more common of the two.</p>
            <p>Varley’s description of Blake’s vision of the “ghost” or anthropomorphic spirit of a flea appears on pp. 54-55 of the pamphlet. Varley “felt convinced by his [Blake’s] mode of proceeding, that he had a real image before him, for he left off, and began on another part of the paper, to make a separate drawing of the mouth of the Flea, which the spirit having opened [as on this plate], he was prevented from proceeding with the first sketch, till he had closed it [as on pl. 3]” (55). This pencil drawing, with the “separate” sketch of the open mouth, was once bound as page 98 of the Smaller Blake-Varley Sketchbook. The drawing is now in Tate Britian, London (Butlin #692.98). The same sketchbook, now dispersed, also once contained a full-length sketch of the flea’s ghost (private collection, Great Britain; Butlin #692.94); Blake developed this image into a tempera painting (Tate Britain, London; Butlin #750).</p>
            <p>The profile on the left is similar to the “Gemini” on pl. 1 (lower right corner), but rather more distant from Blake’s drawings than the version engraved on pl. 1. The center profile of a female (?) child, labeled “Cancer,” is not related to any known drawing by Blake.</p>
            <p>3. Variously bound facing p. 54 or as the fifth plate at the end of the pamphlet; 18.5 × 11.4 cm.; illus. 11.</p>
            <p>Signatures: <hi rend="i">J. Linnell sc.</hi> [left], <hi rend="i">J. Varley. inv.</hi> [right]</p>
            <p>Inscriptions beneath the images: <hi rend="i">Ghost of a Flea. / from Blakes, vision.</hi> [top], <hi rend="i">Reverse of the coin of / Nebuchadnezzar; after Blake.</hi> [lower left]; <hi rend="i">Taurus.</hi> (<hi rend="i">fair class</hi>) [lower right].</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">Second State.</hi> An additional inscription, <hi rend="i">See Page 54</hi>, has been added below the “Ghost of a Flea” (see illus. 11). The first state is known to me only from a copy of the book in the British Museum, Dept. of Prints and Drawings, and a loose impression now in my collection.</p>
            <p>See pl. 2 for drawings related to the ghost of a flea and Varley’s description. Although similar in some respects to the “Gemini” profiles on pls. 1 and 2, the “Taurus” on this plate is too distant from Blake’s possible “Gemini” drawings to warrant the proposal of a Blakean origin. Blake’s pencil drawing of both sides of the coin of Nebuchadnezzar has been untraced since 1939; there is, however, a tracing, probably by Linnell, in the collection of G. Ingli James (see Butlin #704). The front of the coin is pictured on the same unpublished plate bearing the “Cancer” profile—see pl. 1, above, and Essick 246-47.</p>

              <p>This division is organized by individual (say, William Hayley or John Flaxman), with works by and about Blake’s friends and patrons, living individuals with whom he had significant direct and demonstrable contact. It includes Thomas Butts, Robert Hartley Cromek, George Cumberland, John Flaxman and his family, Henry Fuseli, Thomas and William Hayley, John Linnell and his family, Samuel Palmer, James Parker, George Richmond, Thomas Stothard, and John Varley. It does <hi rend="i">not</hi> include important contemporaries with whom Blake’s contact was negligible or non-existent such as John Constable and William Wordsworth and Edmund Burke; such major figures are dealt with more comprehensively elsewhere, and the light they throw upon Blake is very dim.</p>
              <p>Reviews listed here are only for books which are substantially about Blake, not for those with only, say, a chapter on Blake. These reviews are listed under the book reviewed; the authors of the reviews may be recovered from the index.</p>
              <p>I take <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (1977) and <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> (1995), faute de mieux, to be the standard bibliographical authorities on Blake<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> and have noted significant differences from them. <note id="n1"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Except for the states of the plates for Blake’s commercial book engravings, where the standard authority is R.

              <p>The status of electronic “publications” becomes increasingly vexing. Some such works seem to be merely electronic versions of physically stable works, such as <hi rend="i">Colliers Encyclopedia-CD ROM</hi> (1996), with essays by Charles P. Parkhurst, Jr., on Fuseli and Flaxman and by Geoffrey Keynes on Blake (1966) &lt;BB #2040, which replaced that by Mark Schorer &amp; Charles P. Parkhurst, Jr., BB #2673&gt;. Some electronic publications, however, suggest no more knowledge than how to operate a computer, such as reviews invited for the listings of Amazon. Com, which are divided into those by (1) the author, (2) the publisher, and (3) other, perhaps disinterested, remarkers. I have not searched for electronic publications, and I report here only those I have happened upon which appear to bear some authority.</p>

              <p>About a quarter of the works about William Blake recorded here are in languages other than English: Catalan, Chinese, Finnish, French (6), German (5), Hungarian (3), Indonesian, Italian (7), Japanese (21), Korean, Persian, Spanish (4), and Swedish.</p>
              <p>A number of books in non-English languages have scarcely migrated to Albion’s shores, and a distressingly large number of works in English have been reported elsewhere as if really published, but I have been unable to find them in Bodley, the British Library, the University of Toronto Library, Toronto Public Library, the Huntington Library, or elsewhere.</p>

              </head>
              <p>Many, perhaps most, institutions like the Huntington now treat Blake’s works in Illuminated Printing as if they were collections of separate prints, not books, and have disbound and matted the plates individually. This has the great advantage of allowing all the plates to be exhibited at once, rather than only one or two at a time, as when they were bound, and it permits one to see easily the sewing or stab holes in the inner margin—even to perceive occasionally that the inner margins have deckled edges, indicating that they were the outside of the sheet. However, facing pages no longer face one another, and all sense of the sequence of a book is lost.</p>
              <p>None of Blake’s writings in manuscript or in Illuminated Printing is known to have changed hands in the year 2000. The sale of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (E) in 1999 for $2,500,000 provided enough excitement to allow us to coast for some time.</p>
              <p>There were, however, several editions of Blake newly noted here which are notable either for their contents or for the languages in which they were published. There is an edition of <hi rend="i">Jerusalén</hi> in Catalan (1997) and collections of his poetry in Hungarian (<hi rend="i">Versek es Próféciak</hi> [1957]), in Russian (1982), and Persian (<hi rend="i">Viliyam Balayki</hi> [2000]). In addition, there is a much reduced reproduction of the 1877 facsimile of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (D) with earnest annotations by Andrew Solomon (2000).</p>
              <p>Two important editions of Blake’s writings appeared in 2000. The first of these is <hi rend="i">William Blake:</hi> Selected Poetry and Prose, ed. David Fuller for the Longman Annotated Texts series (2000). This is a careful, responsible edition whose chief value is likely to prove to be the generous annotations. Its most original feature is the section justifying, with worrying plausibility, Fuller’s policy of “Modernizing Blake’s Text” (18-26), chiefly in punctuation. Purists may find the cogency of his arguments disturbing.</p>
              <p>Even more useful is David Bindman’s assemblage of the reproductions of the recent Blake Trust editions in <hi rend="i">The Collected Illuminated Books</hi> (2000). This includes reproductions in full size and in glorious color of all 18 of Blake’s works in Illuminated Printing, along with transcriptions of the poems. However, the exceedingly valuable editorial
<pb id="p34-131" n="131"/>
matter provided by the Blake Trust scholars as distinguished as Joseph Viscomi and Robert N. Essick have been abandoned entirely. <hi rend="i">The Collected Illuminated Books</hi> is likely to prove invaluable to all Blake students and irresistible to lovers of beautiful books.</p>

              </head>
              <p>Blake’s purely visual art always receives far less attention than his poems. A few of the volumes of reproductions may be dismissed fairly briskly: a debased but useful Dover edition of Blake’s illuminations to Gray, whose editor is so negligible that he has been left anonymous; half an issue of a Japanese weekly devoted to reproductions of his art (<hi rend="i">Shukan Bijutsokan</hi>); and a calendar with reproductions from the Tate Gallery Blakes.</p>
              <p>By far the most useful new edition of Blake’s art is David Bindman’s tri-lingual reproduction of all 103 of Blake’s watercolors for <hi rend="i">The Divine Comedy: Die Göttliche Komödie; La Divine Comedia.</hi> The size is a generous quarto, but Blake’s watercolors and engravings still have had to be greatly reduced in size. The only other complete color reproduction of Blake’s Dante illustrations is so unwieldy, not to say expensive, that Bindman’s learned version is very welcome.</p>

              </head>
              <p>There were two real discoveries among Blake’s commercial engravings in 2000. This first is a copy of Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (1805) in which Blake’s engravings have been colored, very probably by Blake himself.</p>
              <p>Colored copies of Blake’s commercial engravings are not rare. At any rate, there are probably scores of colored copies of Stedman’s <hi rend="i">Surinam</hi> (1796; 1806), and more than a score of Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> (1797). Indeed, perhaps some of them are being colored as you read this.</p>
              <p>But copies colored by Blake himself are very uncommon. There is a set of Job engravings (1826) and a couple of Canterbury Pilgrims (1810) with Blake’s coloring, but very few more. The discovery of a book with engravings colored by Blake is an important event.</p>
              <p>As usual in such matters, the identification of Blake as the colorist turns largely upon connoisseurship. But when connoisseurs as sophisticated and reliable as Robert Essick and David Bindman agree, the rest of us need not fret in uncertainty.</p>
              <p>The second discovery is of an obscure anonymous novel never previously associated with either Blake or Stothard, which bears a plate clearly signed “<hi rend="i">Stothard d.</hi>” and “<hi rend="i">Blake sc.</hi>” (see illus. 1). It has been many years since a new text with a Blake engraving was found.<ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref> The book is <hi rend="i">Maria: A Novel</hi>, apparently by Elizabeth Blower, the only ephemeral novel for which Blake is known to have made an engraving. As it happens, Blake’s print was previously known, though its host novel was not. And it was found only by serendipity, while looking at the novel’s impressive subscription list. How many other Blake prints are quietly waiting to be discovered in a flash of serendipity? <note id="n6">6 Christopher Heppner, “Another ‘New’ Blake Engraving: More about Blake and William Nicholson,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 12 (1978-79): 193-97.</note></p>

              <p>A surprising number of Blake catalogues are reported here for the first time, from 1798 (a reprint), 1927 (Woolwich), 1928 (Paris), 1959 (a reprint), 1977 (a reprint),<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> 1990 (Buffalo), and 1995 (Mexico City). However, the only substantial exhibitions were in Finland of the British Museum Print Room Blakes and the Tate Blake exhibition gathered from round the world. <note id="n7">7 This is a reprint of <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (1977), with a somewhat breathless attempt to list (in a postscript) and describe (in an introduction) the most important Blake publications recorded since <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> (1995).</note></p>
              <p>The Helsinki catalogue is in Finnish and Swedish, neither of which can I read with confidence (my wife interpolates: “or at all”). It was apparently organized by David Bindman and Simon Balsom, and even a monoglot can discern that it is very generously illustrated. And the British Museum Print Room Blakes are very fine.</p>
              <p>Far more important, of course, is the major international Blake exhibition at the Tate Gallery. This was very fine indeed and a great credit to its organizer, Robin Hamlyn. Many of the works shown, such as Blake’s color prints and the very large drawings, can never be satisfactorily reproduced, and seeing the originals is an entirely different kind of experience from handling reproductions. In particular, the sequence of all 12 of the suite of Large Color Prints is awesome. And they are preceded by hundreds of prints from <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> and elsewhere. In particular, all hundred plates from the only colored copy of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (E) could be seen at a glance, though of course to absorb them required hours. When disbound and hung separately like this, the leaves from the works in Illuminated Printing become a collection of separate pictures rather than a consecutive verbal narrative. The effect is wonderful—but, for literary scholars, somewhat distracting.</p>

              <p>Aside from a few books owned by William Blake riff-raff from Bristol and Stockland and Aberdeen and Axbridge, the only discovery of a book from the poet’s library is John Quincy’s <hi rend="i">Pharmacopœia Officinis</hi> . . .

              <p>Probably the most substantial scholarship is in Michael Phillip’s <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi>: The Creation of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> from Manuscript to Illuminating Printing (2000). In it, Phillips attempts to record, with the aid of generous and excellent reproductions, “how the poems evolved and were made” (2). The impression is conveyed that all the evidence is here, from minute alterations in Blake’s Notebook to babies abandoned in the street (for “Holy Thursday” in <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>) and proprietary chapels built on the green in Lambeth (behind “The Garden of Love”).<ref target="n8" type="note">8</ref> There is evidence about a previously unidentified relative of Catherine Blake in Battersea and a good deal of argument tending to show that Blake’s works in color printing were passed through the press twice, once for the engraved outline and once for the added color. If this is the way the Blakes printed—and there is some disconcerting evidence from pin-holes and defective registration to support the argument—then the printing of the works in Color Printing must have been very slow and elaborate indeed. But the evidence for double printing has not persuaded Joseph Viscomi, Robert N. Essick—or me. <note id="n8">8 However, Horwood’s great map of London and Westminster (1792-99) does not seem to record a green in Lambeth.</note></p>
              <p>The purpose of K. E. Smith in his <hi rend="i">Analysis of William Blake’s Early Writings and Designs to 1790, including SONGS OF INNOCENCE</hi> (1999) is the evaluation of “Blake’s earliest works within their own terms and of seeing <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> as culmination rather than prologue” (185-86). The results are surprisingly rewarding; by carefully eschewing the temptations of hindsight—the “Two Contrary States of the Human Soul” and Urizen—he is able to consider Blake’s writing as Blake himself must have seen it, first writing songs at random, in <hi rend="i">The Island in the Moon</hi> and elsewhere, and then selecting those that might make a coherent collection in <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence.</hi> However latent the poems of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> may be in those of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>, there is little evidence that Blake saw them lurking there until well after the poems had been etched, printed, colored, covered, and sold. Blake’s discoveries in his poetry become our own in Smith’s <hi rend="i">Analysis.</hi></p>
              <p>Kathleen Lumsden’s <hi rend="i">Knight of the Living Dead</hi> (2000), despite its pop title, promises to examine “Blake within the context of spiritualism” (16). This is a subject of very great interest, dealing with Blake’s visions of God and angels from early childhood, his drawings of visionary heads, his spiritual voices dictating to him—and Blake arguing with the voices—and Catherine speaking to Blake after his death. Blake lived in a world of spirits, a domain which he thought was the only real world.</p>
              <p>But Lumsden’s rhetorical world is altogether more familiar. “Blake’s spiritualism . . . is the telos of his deconstruction of the aesthetic binaries of the natural and the conventional,” “his experiments in textuality . . . [<hi rend="i">are</hi>] experiments in spiritualism” (138, 162). We’ve been here before—and neither the Knight nor the Living Dead are often visible in her book.</p>
              <p>Patrick Menneteau’s <hi rend="i">La Folie dans la poésie de William Blake</hi> (1999) also seems to promise novelties, but its discourse is fairly conventional: “La litérature, pour Blake, . . . est le champ d’une bataille spirituelle” (303). The subject is far more “la battaille” than “La Folie.”</p>
              <p>Barbara Lachman’s <hi rend="i">Voices for Catherine Blake</hi> (2000) is a fictitious “autobiography” of Catherine Blake. It is told by various voices, mostly Catherine’s, but including the voice of one who seems to be a kind of talk-show interviewer. The facts are fairly closely based on Blake’s life—we know very little about Catherine separate from her husband. One of the chief novelties is Catherine’s work for the blind, a proper middle-class North American housewifely virtue somewhat surprising in the wife of an obscure London artisan in 1790.</p>
              <p>Mark Dominik’s account of <hi rend="i">Black Suns &amp; Moons in Works of Daniel Andreev, William Blake, &amp; Stanislav Grof</hi> (2000) is surprisingly interesting even if, or perhaps because, one has never heard of Daniel Andreev or Stanislav Grof. Like Blake, Andreev wrote of new worlds with strange names like Shrastis and Witzraors. Though Andreev was writing in the isolation of a Stalinist prison camp, his work has an “intriguing literary parallel with Blake’s <hi rend="i">Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>,” which might lead us to conclude “that Blake and Andreev are giving us similar and mutually-supportive insights into another aspect of ‘reality’ far beyond anything we know from the material world” (9, 10, 13).</p>
              <p>Similarly off-center is Michael Dibdin’s novel called <hi rend="i">Dark Spectre</hi> (1995) about a cult whose followers “believed that William Blake’s poetry was the Third Testament and Sam [<hi rend="i">the Leader</hi>] the second coming of Jesus Christ” (306). However, most of the novel is about the ritual murders which serve as the sect’s rite of initiation.</p>
              <p>Ratomir Ristic’s <hi rend="i">Introducing William Blake</hi> (1996) is surprising in being published in Yugoslavia but printed in English. About 40% of the book is Blake’s poems, and slightly more is reprints of background prose, from 1931 (Edmund Wilson’s <hi rend="i">Axel’s Castle</hi>) to 1995—plus a previously unprinted lecture by a Yugoslavian critic.</p>

              <p><hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> published 27 new essays on Blake, and the <hi rend="i">Blake Journal</hi> 17 more. Of these, perhaps the most substantial are “Blake in the Marketplace,” Robert Essick’s invaluable annual essay, and “Blake and His Circle.”</p>
              <p>One of the most fundamental tools of Blake scholarship has become the online William Blake Archive conducted by Joseph Viscomi, Robert Essick, &amp; Morris Eaves. The theoretical foundations of the undertaking are attacked by Andrew Cooper &amp; Michael Simpson in <hi rend="i">Wordsworth Circle</hi> in 1999 and 2000.<ref target="n9" type="note">9</ref> Their objections are summed up in their second essay entitled “Looks Good in Practice, But Does It Work in Theory?” The response from the keepers of the archive in <hi rend="i">Wordsworth Circle</hi> (1999) seems persuasive, but the issues are perplexing to those, like myself, who are electronically bemused. <note id="n9">9 See also Julia Bryan, “Blake Unbound,” <hi rend="i">Endeavours</hi> (Fall 1997) and Lisa Guernsey, “Searchable Archive Zooms In on William Blake’s Illuminated Books,” <hi rend="i">Chronicle of Higher Education Information Technology</hi> (17 Sept 1997).</note></p>
              <p>Jeffrey Mertz records in <hi rend="i">Notes and Queries</hi> (2000) his discovery of a shrewd reference by Thomas Frognall Dibdin (1811) to the elongated “‘Procrustes’ men” in Blake’s drawings.</p>
              <p>Equally fundamental is Joyce Townsend’s ground-breaking chemical and artistic “analysis of Blake’s tempera medium” which both confirms what Blake’s friends said about his materials and takes us much further forward in understanding the artistic techniques upon which he particularly prided himself.</p>
              <p>Japanese Blake scholarship is coming of age. One of the most impressive recent Blake essays is Hikari Sato’s “Creative Contradiction in Proverbs of Hell: On the Media and Contents of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>” in <hi rend="i">Studies in English Literature</hi> [Japan] (1999). The essay argues that the “Proverbs of Hell” are fundamentally antinomian, not an assertion of an alternative sacred code. This alternative code “would be the worst nightmare in the sense that the discourse on anti-canonisation had canonised itself” (32, 30).</p>

              <p>In 2000, few essays were, like June K. Singer’s book, “not bound by the strictures of literary criticism, nor by adherence to historical fact” (<hi rend="i">Blake, Jung, and the Collective Unconscious</hi> [2000] xi). My favorite is the devotion shown by all journalists to the long-exploded story of Blake and his wife basking in the nude in the tropical sunshine of London. Typical of such comments, though more impertinent than most, is Tim Marlow’s review of the Tate exhibition: “was he a nudist? . . . Even if the tale is untrue, it’s still significant” (<hi rend="i">tate</hi> [2000]). But it is significant only about the standards of journalism and our will to believe, not about William Blake.</p>

              <p>P. 74: The full-face pencil portrait in the top row is identified (correctly) as Tom “Paine-like” by John Keane, <hi rend="i">Tom Paine:</hi> A Political Life (Boston, N.Y., Toronto, London: Little Brown and Company, 1995), photograph after 426;<ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref> the subject was not identified at all by Keynes, Erdman, Bentley, &amp;c. <note id="n11">11 For engravings of 1792-93 of Paine by William Sharp after George Romney and by A. Schule after C. Schule, see Jack Fruchtman, Jr., <hi rend="i">Tom Paine, Apostle of Freedom</hi> (N.Y., London: Four Walls Eight Windows Press, 1994) (at 274) and Keene (after 426).</note></p>
              <p>If, as seems probable, Blake’s portrait was drawn from the life, it must have been made before 13 September 1792 when Paine left England. This is the only contemporary evidence that Blake was in direct contact with Paine.</p>
              <p>The fact that the sketch is in Blake’s precious Notebook suggests that Paine was at Blake’s house in Lambeth rather than Blake in Paine’s lodging in Bromley, Kent (about 8 miles southeast of Lambeth, beyond Camberwell and Dulwich), where he was staying inconspicuously with the engraver William Sharp in the spring of 1792.<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> Sharp was probably engraving Romney’s portrait of Paine at the time. <note id="n12">12 Keane, <hi rend="i">Tom Paine</hi> 342; Joseph Johnson had advised Paine to lie low because of the furor caused by his writings.</note></p>

                <figDesc>The photographer has omitted the signatures below the design: “<hi rend="i">Stothard d.</hi>,” “<hi rend="i">Blake sc.</hi>”
                            <p>The heroine, Maria Mordaunt, has fallen in love with the son of Lord Aubrey, who had been forced by his father to marry a rich old woman with “a monstrous great fortune”; she is “vastly ugly, and old, and disagreeable” (as his valet tells Maria’s maid, pp. 23, 24, 29). The old wife had been infirm but inconveniently recovers.</p><p>Maria’s friend Lady Melmoth takes Maria to Dunlough Castle in order, as she says,
<q>
“to enjoy the delightful horrors of Gothic galleries, winding avenues, gaping chimnies, and dreary vaults . . . and I dare say [<hi rend="i">Maria</hi>] will, by the aid of imagination, behold gigantic heads and legs; and hear the voices of other times come whistling in the winds, and see the grey mists rising slowly from the lake, like an aged man supported by a ghost in mid-air, and presently dissolving in a shower of blood.—Are you, Miss Mordaunt,” continued her ladyship, “a lover of this kind of sublimity?” [<hi rend="i">1: 88</hi>]
</q>
Of course Maria is. In the forest-garden of the Castle, she comes to
<q>
a marble bust, as large as life: the surprize made her start back a few paces—but what were her sensations, when, on re-approaching to examine what the hand of sculpture had placed there, she beheld the features of—Aubrey.<lb/>
His spectre, shown by the pale reflex of the moon, gliding through her chamber at the dread hour of mid-night, would not have had a more terrific effect upon her imagination; she started back appalled;—her frame alternately experienced the extremes of heat and cold—tears of horror gushed to her eyes, and the violent emotions of her heart would inevitably have consigned her to a state of insensibility, had not an impassioned burst of hysterical tears, accompanied by shrill shrieks of woe, prevented that effect. She clasped, with her shivering arms, this death-like and most awful imitation of nature—she pressed with he[<hi rend="i">r</hi>] pallid lips, the heart-chilling resemblance of <hi rend="i">those</hi> from whence she had so often heard the tender accents of persuasive softness, the soul of manly sense, and the vivid graces of Attic wit—Whilst she yet gazed in an agony of dumb despair on each memory-treasured feature, a form majestic elegant and noble drew near (unobserved by her) that side of the pedestal on which she leant.—“Great God! What do I behold!” cried she [<hi rend="i">i.e., he</hi>].<lb/>
Maria knew it to be the voice of Aubrey, and, in the distraction of her tone [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>], fancied she had beheld the lips of the bust quiver with the articulation of the sounds. [<hi rend="i">1: 131-32</hi>]
</q></p><p>It is not clear to me why Maria “started back appalled” when seeing Aubrey’s bust, unless she thought it indicated he was

dead. At the time she did not know that Aubrey was the brother of her hostess.</p><p>Not long thereafter, Aubrey’s inconvenient wife accommodatingly dies, and the lovers are united.</p><p>Stothard’s design faithfully depicts the scene described in the novel.</p></figDesc>
              </figure>
              <p>However, among “Book Illustrations Known Only through Separate Impressions,” Robert N. Essick, <hi rend="i">The Separate Plates of William Blake</hi>: A Catalogue (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983), records (242-43), and reproduces (figure 110) the scene of “A Lady Embracing a Bust.” He records two copies of a first state before imprint (Huntington, Royal Academy), and two more after the inscriptions were added (American Blake Foundation, British Museum Print Room).</p>
              <pb id="p34-140" n="140"/>
              <p>Blake had worked for Cadell before only when Cadell was a member of a congery (Ariosto, 1783). However, he had frequently copied Stothard’s designs: for Enfield (1780), Bonnycastle (1782), Kimpton (1782), <hi rend="i">Lady’s New and Polite Pocket Memorandum Book</hi> (1782), <hi rend="i">Novelist’s Magazine</hi> 8-9 (1782-83), Ritson (1782), John Scott (1782), Ariosto (1783), Chaucer (1783), “Fall of Rosamund” (1783), <hi rend="i">Wit’s Magazine</hi> (1784), “Zephyrus and Flora” (1784), and Fenning &amp; Collyer (1784-85). This plate for <hi rend="i">Maria</hi> may therefore be the last one he engraved after Stothard.</p>
              <p>The novel has no author’s name on the title page, but the dedication from St. James’s Place “To the Honourable Mrs Ward” is signed “E. B.” The author of <hi rend="i">Maria</hi> (1785) is identified in [John Watkins &amp; Frederick Shoberl], <hi rend="i">A Biographical Dictionary of the Living Authors of Great Britain and Ireland</hi> (London: Henry Colburn, 1816) as Miss Eliza Blower who was “born at Worcester, 1763; daughter of a gentleman distinguished by his steady attachment to an unsuccessful candidate for her native city. Her literary exertions, which began at a very early age, were made with a view to benefit her family.” She may be related to Richard Blower who appears in the subscription list. At the age of 22 when the novel was published, she was only a little older than her heroine (19). She was also apparently an actress, in Ireland for five years and in London in 1787-88.<ref target="n20" type="note">20</ref><note id="n20">20 <hi rend="i">The Feminist Companion to Literature in English</hi>: Women Writers from the Middle Ages to the Present, ed.

              <p>The “List of Subscribers” includes a surprising number of persons connected with the arts who were or might have been known to Blake at the time, including [Richard] Cosway [miniaturist], [Maria] Cosway [artist], John Flaxman [sculptor], William Hayley, Esq. [author and patron], J[ohn] Hawkins [patron of Blake], Ozias Humphry [painter], Jeremiah Meyer [miniaturist], “Mrs. Mathew | Miss Mathew | Mr. F. Mathew,” Sir Joshua Reynolds [painter], “Mr. [?<hi rend="i">George</hi>] Romney [<hi rend="i">artist</hi>], 6 copies,” R. B. Sheridan [dramatist and politician], 6 copies,” [Thomas] Stothard [book illustrator], and Josiah Wedgwood [pottery manufacturer].</p>
              <p>The novel is sentimental and even Gothic to a degree. The author says that
<q>
my leading aim has been to pourtray, in the simple but impassioned colouring of nature, the operation of a mind unacquainted with the world—young, artless, sensible, and refined—under the impulse of a lively and insuperable attachment; and to inculcate the principle of <hi rend="i">Active Benevolence</hi>, by displaying its beneficial effects. [1: ii]
</q></p>
              <p>The heroine, Maria Mordaunt, is 19, and already for her “My books and my music are my chief, almost my only amusement, Sir.” (1: 5)
<q><hi rend="i">H</hi>er understanding was of the first rate; her disposition soft, delicate, and flexible; her eyes were blue and beautifully formed; her other features were soft, lively, and engaging. . . . [<hi rend="i">And she has</hi>] a figure that blended dignity with all the sprightly grace and easy negligence which poets ascribe to nymphs of sylvan race .... [1: 11-12]
</q></p>
              <p>The novel was widely reviewed in <hi rend="i">Critical Review</hi> 60 (Sept 1785): 233-34 (the young author “is by no means deficient in many of the requisites which should occupy her task”); <hi rend="i">English Review</hi>, 6 (1785): 232 (“In the execution it is not altogether defective . . . and few of the present run of novels deserve so much praise”); §<hi rend="i">European Magazine</hi> 8 (1785): 394; §<hi rend="i">Monthly Review</hi> 73 (1785): 392; and <hi rend="i">Town and Country Magazine</hi> 17 (Nov 1785): 658 (“above the common run of novels”).</p>

              <p>The palette is significantly similar to that in the colored copy of the Canterbury Pilgrims (Fitzwilliam Museum). More significantly, it is similar to the tempera of the same subject.<ref target="n22" type="note">22</ref> In both colored engraving and tempera, the mother has the same auburn hair and blue dress and cap (darker blue in the engraving) with white frills at the top. In each, the sky is shades of blue and the clouds pink (both more vivid in the engraving). <note id="n22"><hi rend="s">22</hi> The tempera is described and reproduced in Martin Butlin, <hi rend="i">The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</hi> (1981), #366, illus. 347.</note></p>
              <p>There are also some significant differences. The frightened little girl’s dress is pink in the engraving, muted yellow in the tempera, and her hair is auburn (like her mother’s) in the engraving, an indeterminate brown in the tempera; the bottom of the design is blue water in the engraving, while the same area in the tempera is an indeterminate brown; the ground by the upper tree is yellowish brown in the engraving, soft greenish brown in the tempera; the bank above the horse is a curious dull blue in the engraving and brown in the tempera; the clouds are pink in the engraving, vaguely white in the tempera.</p>
              <p>These differences demonstrate that the colorer of the engraving was not simply copying the tempera—such servile copying would be very unlike Blake. But the manner, tact, and delicacy of the coloring, a good deal beyond what might be expected of a professional tinter, suggest that the hand which held the brush was that of William Blake.</p>

              <q>
I cannot enough admire the hardiness of Bentley, who would expunge these two last Lines, as proper and surely as beautiful as any in the whole Poem, and substitute cold expressions foreign to the Author’s [Judgement <hi rend="i">del</hi>] probable and natural meaning, viz. “that they left Paradise <hi rend="u">with regret</hi>,” if any one thinks otherwise I desire no better proof of the state of his feelings.

              <p>Description: Signed on the title page “William Blake his Book” (the first two words on either side of “A COMPLETE” and the last two flanking “In FOUR PARTS.” (My information about the book derives from a reproduction of the title page generously sent me in July 2000 by John Windle.)</p>
              <p>The handwriting is not characteristic of the poet, in for instance <hi rend="i">Tiriel, Vala</hi> (where four hands by the poet have been identified), The Ballads (Pickering) Manuscript, and <hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon.</hi> However, it is significantly similar to the writing on the title page of Anon., <hi rend="i">A Political and Satirical History</hi> (?1757) (reproduced in <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> [1995] 315) which was apparently inscribed by the poet in 1773.

                <p>A copy described in the eBay electronic auction (Sept. 2000) as “disbound as issued” is said to be “Boldly signed at the top” “Blake’s Library” and therefore associated with the poet.

              <p>While in a Soviet prison camp, Daniel Andreev (d. 1959) wrote a strange, trans-material, multi-dimensional work called <hi rend="i">Roza Mira</hi> (published as a samizdat [“in the 1970s”], in book form in [1991], and translated as <hi rend="i">The Rose of the World</hi> by Jordan Roberts [1997]); Dominik finds “a intriguing literary parallel between Andreev’s chapter on ‘Shrastrs and Witzraors’ and a section of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> (1793),” each with “an inverted world with a red sky, lit by a black-but-shining orb.” If we follow Stansilav Grof. <hi rend="i">LSD Psychotherapy</hi> (1994), we might conclude “that Blake and Andreev are giving us similar and mutually-supportive insights into another aspect of ‘reality’ far beyond anything we know from the material world” (9, 10, 13).</p>

<q>
From the time of Sir Thomas More’s Utopai, many works of a similar kind to the present, describing the laws, manners, and customs of countries supposed to be found in the interior of America, or as with the present case and the Adventures of Gaudentio de Lucca,<ref target="n24" type="note">24</ref> have been given to the public, and received with various success, according to the abilities of the inventors. They have sometimes afforded the means of venting oblique satire on the practices of particular countries, and sometimes have been levelled at individuals. The present performance is introduced to the world with very little art, and seems intended to propagate the licentiousness of French principle, in morals, in religion, and in politics. The Sophians, the people here held up for [<hi rend="i">word illeg: emulation?</hi>], appear to have been well read in Mandeville, of the beginning of this century, with the French philosophers of the present day.
