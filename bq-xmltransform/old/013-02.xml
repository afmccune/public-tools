        <p>PREFATORY NOTE: I began work on this subject in 1974 and delivered a paper on Blake and Swedenborg at the University of Lund. In the summer of 1978, thanks to a grant from the Nordenskjöld Fund of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, I was able to complete my research. I presented the results at a graduate seminar at the University of Stockholm in September 1978. In undertaking this task, I was greatly assisted by librarians at the Royal Library, Stockholm; the British Library; and Swedenborg House, London. I am also grateful for information and advice from G. E. Bentley, Jr., Ray A. Deck, Jr., Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, Pastor O. Hjern, Inge Jonsson, Peter Lineham, and Edward P. Thompson.</p>

          <p>The formative influence of Emanuel Swedenborg on William Blake was once an article of faith among Blake scholars and enthusiasts. Blake was supposed to have come from a family of Swedenborgians; William Allingham imagined the fourteen-year-old Blake meeting the eighty-four-year-old Swedenborg in the streets of London; Alexander Gilchrist declared "of all modern men, the engraver’s apprentice was to grow up likest to Emanuel Swedenborg."<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> We now know that the story of Blake’s Swedenborgian background is a myth supported by no verifiable facts,<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> yet there can be no doubt that Swedenborg’s writings and doctrines are of unusual importance in relation to Blake’s. Although much has been written about Swedenborg’s influence on Blake, Blake’s complex and shifting attitude toward Swedenborgianism has not yet been adequately described. My purpose here is both to reconstruct that attitude in its several phases and to define Blake’s relationship to the Swedenborgian milieu of his own day. <note id="n1"><hi rend="s">1</hi> See Alexander Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi> (1863, rev. ed. 1880), ed. Ruthven Todd (London and New York: J. M. Dent and E. P. Dutton, rev. ed., 1945), p. 13.</note><note id="n2"><hi rend="s">2</hi> See J. G. Davies, <hi rend="i">The Theology of William Blake</hi> (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1948), pp. 31-53; David V. Erdman, "Blake’s Early Swedenborgianism: a Twentieth-Century Legend," <hi rend="i">Comparative Literature</hi>, V (1953), 247-57; Nancy Bogen, "The Problem of William Blake’s Early Religion," <hi rend="i">Personalist</hi>, XLIX (1968), 509-22.</note></p>
          <p>What we know factually about Blake’s Swedenborgian interests may be summarized briefly. Blake owned and annotated at least three of Swedenborg’s books: <hi rend="i">Heaven and Hell, Divine Love and Divine Wisdom</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Divine Providence</hi>; he mentions two others in such a way as to suggest that he read them: <hi rend="i">Earths in Our Universe</hi> and <hi rend="i">Universal Theology</hi> [<hi rend="i">True Christian Religion</hi>]. He and his wife attended the first General Conference of the New Jerusalem Church in 1789. Then, turning sharply against the Swedenborgians, he satirized them and their Messenger in <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> (1790-93). After that he mentions Swedenborg twice in his published writings—in <hi rend="i">A Descriptive Catalogue</hi> (1809) and in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (1804-10). At first this may not seem like the chronicle of a major intellectual relationship, but the General Conference of 1789 is the only meeting of any organization that Blake is known to have attended, and only thirteen books annotated by him have survived. So when we consider these facts in relation to the amount of information about Blake available, they bulk relatively large, and it cannot be doubted that Blake found Swedenborg a figure of unusual interest. The nature of Blake’s interest in Swedenborg can, moreover, be divided into four distinct periods. From the late 1780s until 1790, Blake’s attitude was studious and respectful; even in disagreeing with Swedenborg during these years, Blake expresses himself so as to put the most optimistic construction upon Swedenborg’s doctrines. In 1790 Blake repudiated Swedenborg vehemently in the marginalia to <hi rend="i">Divine Providence</hi>, and he wrote at least part of the satire of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.</hi> From 1793, when <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> was completed,<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> to about 1800 there is little to indicate interest in Swedenborg on Blake’s part; but after
<pb id="p13-65" n="65"/>
1800 Swedenborgian concepts and references began to reappear in Blake’s works, and in 1809 he exhibited a picture on a Swedenborgian subject. In this late period, Blake’s view of Swedenborg tends to be ambivalent, as typified by the exclamation of Rintrah and Palamabron in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>: "O Swedenborg! strongest of men, the Samson shorn by the Churches!"<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> Working with the documentary information that we have, and making reasonable inferences from what we know of the history of English Swedenborgianism, we can account for some of these changes in Blake’s attitude. At the same time, we can hope to illuminate one aspect of the development of Blake’s thought which was insufficiently discussed in my book on that subject.<ref target="n5" type="note">5</ref><note id="n3"><hi rend="s">3</hi> On the dating of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>, see David V.

          <p>We do not know precisely when Blake became interested in Swedenborg, but a date c. 1787 seems likely. Blake’s annotations to <hi rend="i">Heaven and Hell</hi> include a reference to Swedenborg’s <hi rend="i">Earths in Our Solar System</hi>,<ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref> first published in English in 1787; and in that year John Flaxman, who could have introduced Blake to Swedenborgian circles, left for a seven-year stay in Italy. An even earlier date is possible, for in 1779 a William Blake was among the subscribers to Jacob Duché’s <hi rend="i">Discourses on Several Subjects</hi>, and Duché was a Swedenborgian, although he had not yet declared his allegiance publicly.<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> (Another Swedenborgian, William Sharp, engraved the frontispiece after Benjamin West, showing male and female angels.) Duché became Chaplain and Secretary of the Society for the Reception of Orphan Girls in 1782, and opened his house in Lambeth to meetings of a Swedenborgian group which became known as the Theosophical Society. "As public worship had not yet been established in the New Church," says Robert Hindmarsh, "many of our friends attended his ministry on the Sundays."<ref target="n8" type="note">8</ref> It is possible that Blake attended some of Duché’s meetings, and Blake’s reference to what "was asserted in the society"<ref target="n9" type="note">9</ref> about the nature of influx may refer to a meeting of the Theosophical Society. However, Blake’s first specifically datable contact with the Swedenborgians was at the General Conference of April 13-17, 1789, when William and Catherine Blake entered their names in the Conference’s Minute Book and so implied assent to the forty-two theological propositions which were unanimously approved by the participants.<ref target="n10" type="note">10</ref><note id="n6"><hi rend="s">6</hi> As Blake refers to this book as "Worlds in [the] Universe," Erdman speculates on the possible existence of "a different translation, perhaps of later date" (E 800). But <hi rend="i">Worlds in the Universe</hi> was evidently an alternate title for <hi rend="i">Earths in Our Universe</hi>, and the 1787 edition is cited under the former title in <hi rend="i">The Apocalypse Revealed</hi> (Manchester: C. Wheeler, 1791), II, # 716.</note><note id="n7"><hi rend="s">7</hi> On Jacob Duché, see <hi rend="i">DAB</hi>, s.v., and Charles Higham, "The Reverend Jacob Duché, M.A.: II. His Later Life and Ministry in England," <hi rend="i">New Church Review</hi>, XXII (1915), 404-20. Duché’s son, Thomas Spence Duché, was a young artist who studied under Benjamin West in London and who may have visited the Prophets of Avignon in 1788; see Albert Frank Gegenheimer, "Artist in Exile: the Story of Thomas Spence Duché," <hi rend="i">PMBR</hi>, LXXIX (1955), 3-26.</note><note id="n8"><hi rend="s">8</hi><hi rend="i"> Rise and Progress of the New Jerusalem Church in England, America and Other Parts</hi>, ed.

This account by an eyewitness to and participant in the early history of the New Jerusalem Church is our most important single source of information about the development of Swedenborgianism in England. However, it must be remembered that Robert Hindmarsh was not a disinterested party as concerns the schisms within the New Jerusalem Church, and his account must be balanced by other, independent ones such as those of Manoah Sibley and, most notably, Thomas Robinson (see below).</note><note id="n9"><hi rend="s">9</hi> Annotations to <hi rend="i">Divine Love and Divine Wisdom</hi>, E 598.</note><note id="n10"><hi rend="s">10</hi> Reprinted in <hi rend="i">Rise and Progress</hi>, pp. 98-99.</note></p>
          <p>Among the propositions (all taken from Swedenborg’s works) which clearly agreed with Blake’s own expressed views were those affirming free will, condemning predestination, and declaring that "all have a capacity to be regenerated, because all are redeemed, each one according to his state." Blake would also have agreed with Proposition 33: "Now it is allowable to enter into the Mysteries of Faith." (The words "Now it is allowable" were inscribed over the door of the New Jerusalem church in Eastcheap, in contrast to the "Thou Shalt Not" to be written over the door of the Chapel in Blake’s "Garden of Love.") The Conference’s reaffirmation of Swedenborg’s declaration that a Last Judgment had taken place in 1757 must have particularly interested

Blake, as that was of course the year of his own birth. Blake would have sympathized with the Conference’s endorsement of Swedenborg’s statement that the things seen by the visionary "are not fictions but were really seen and heard in a state in which I was broad awake," for the Swedenborgians had to defend their Messenger, just as Blake had to defend himself, against charges of "enthusiasm" and madness. Furthermore, many Swedenborgians shared another of Blake’s deepest concerns—opposition to slavery. Swedenborg taught that the inhabitants of the interior of Africa had preserved a direct intuition of God, and as a result the first abolitionist society was founded by Swedenborgians in Norrköping in 1779.<ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref> The founder of that group was one of the most active of European abolitionists, Charles Bernhard Wadström; and Wadström with another Swedish delegate, Augustus Nordenskjöld, attended the 1789 General Conference. Wadström and Nordenskjöld were deeply involved in a plan to set up a free community for whites and blacks on the west coast of Africa, and Blake can hardly have been unaware of (or uninterested in) this well publicized project. A spirit of millenarian expectation was abroad, and even the pedestrian Hindmarsh was moved to something like poetry: " . . . The tree of life, whose roots are planted in the gardens and streets of the New Jerusalem, as

well as on either bank of its river, spontaneously sprung up before our eyes, luxuriant in foliage, and laden with the sweetest fruits of paradise in endless variety and abundance."<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> It must have seemed to Blake as if there were a possibility of sharing his own prophetic vision with a community of kindred spirits—as if, indeed, the New Jerusalem were descending. <note id="n11"><hi rend="s">11</hi> See R.

          <p>For more concrete evidence of what attracted Blake to Swedenborg’s doctrines, we must go to the marginalia to <hi rend="i">Heaven and Hell</hi> and to <hi rend="i">Divine Love and Divine Wisdom.</hi> Those to <hi rend="i">Heaven and Hell</hi> are brief.<ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref> They begin with a defense of the imagination, addressed not to Swedenborg but to a previous owner of the volume. In addition, two paragraphs about the state of little children in heaven are scored in a margin, #513 has Blake’s note "See N 73 Worlds in Universe for account of Instructing Spirits" (E 591), and #588 has Blake’s note concerning the relationship of heavens to hells. According to Swedenborg, "Both Heaven and the World of Spirits may be considered as convexities, under which are arrangements of those infernal mansions." This Blake elucidates: "Under every <hi rend="u">Good</hi> is a hell. i.e. hell is the outward or external of heaven. &amp; is of the body of the lord. for nothing is destroyed" (E 591). Here we see Blake hopefully pushing Swedenborg’s idea toward a conception of unity according to which Hells are only mistakes for Heavens; for Blake Hell (not yet having acquired the subversive sense it bears in <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>) is merely negative and therefore redeemable. Later, Blake would have to admit that this was not the meaning Swedenborg had intended, and Blake would accordingly condemn Swedenborg’s view as predestinarian. <note id="n13"><hi rend="s">13</hi> Blake’s copy (published 1784) is in the Harvard College Library. Bentley (<hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, p. 696) makes a "plausible guess" that the marginalia were written in 1788.</note></p>
          <p>Blake’s notes to <hi rend="i">Divine Love and Divine Wisdom</hi><ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref> once more show Blake working out his own ideas through the medium of Swedenborg, finding as many areas of agreement as possible, and reasoning away differences. In these marginalia Blake’s chief concern is the same as Swedenborg’s: the relationship of the spiritual and the natural worlds, and hence of the spiritual and the natural man. As Blake’s tractates of c. 1788 show, Blake believes that although the two can be distinguished there is a unity underlying them, and that this unity is perceived by the imagination or Poetic Genius.<ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref> Blake hopefully glosses Swedenborg’s "spiritual idea" (#7) as "Poetic idea," and where Swedenborg writes of the Angels’ reception of Love and Wisdom from the Lord (#10), Blake writes: "He who Loves feels love descend into him &amp; if he has wisdom may percieve it is from the Poetic Genius which is the Lord" (E 592). The idea of Poetic Genius enables Blake to take Swedenborg’s statements as metaphors. "The Negation of God constitutes Hell," Swedenborg writes, "and in the Christian world the Negation of the Lord’s Divinity" (#13); Blake notes: "the Negation of the Poetic Genius" (E 593). If Swedenborg’s God can be seen as a manifestation of the indwelling human imagination, then Blake can regard himself as in agreement. <note id="n14"><hi rend="s">14</hi> London: W. Chalken, 1788. Blake’s copy is in the British Library. Bentley (<hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, p. 696) asserts that the reference by Blake to "what was asserted in the society" suggests a date of annotation after the General Conference of 1789; however, as mentioned above, the reference could be to the earlier Theosophical Society. Bentley’s conjectural ?1789 remains a plausible date for the annotations nevertheless.</note><note id="n15"><hi rend="s">15</hi><hi rend="i"> There is No Natural Religion</hi> (2 sets) and <hi rend="i">All Religions are One</hi>, E 1-2.

          <p>On the larger subject of the relations between spiritual and natural worlds, Swedenborg’s characteristic view is that they "are so distinct, that they have nothing in common with each other; but nevertheless are so created, that they communicate, yea are joined together, by Correspondences" (#83). Blake is quick to seize upon passages which emphasize the link, implicit in such a view, between spiritual and natural. For example, Swedenborg says that the human mind can only shake off appearances by an investigation of the cause, which in turn cannot do "without keeping the Understanding in spiritual Light" (#40). "This Man can do while in the body"—notes Blake (E 593). According to Swedenborg, there are "three degrees of Altitude" (#237)—Natural, Spiritual, and Celestial: the man in whom the spiritual Degree is open comes into divine Wisdom when he dies, "and may also come into it by laying asleep the Sensations of the Body, and by Influx from above at the same Time into the Spirituals of his Mind" (#257). Blake comments: "this is while in the Body / This is to be understood as unusual in our time but common in ancient" (E 596). Here and in similar passages Blake takes Swedenborg’s view to be that the natural man can be irradiated by spiritual light in this life. This is of course Blake’s own view, as is the idea, also shared by Swedenborg, that ancient men had a greater capacity for spiritual vision than their modern counterparts.</p>
          <p>At some times, however, Swedenborg emphasizes the discrete natures of the two worlds, and then Blake is distinctly uneasy. In the Swedenborgian universe there are two suns, a living sun in the spiritual world and a dead one in the material world. "It follows that . . . the dead Sun itself was created by the living Sun from the Lord" (#164). "How," Blake objects, "could life create death" (E 594); "the dead Sun is only a phantasy of evil Man." As with suns, so with souls. Swedenborg explicitly denies the existence of portions of divinity in man, regarding such a belief as a sort of spiritual narcissism: "for if there was . . . any Thing Divine in them, then it would not be beloved by others, but it would love itself" (#49). Blake objects to this because it rules out the divine in man—"for if a thing loves it is infinite" (E 593). Still he hopes that the difference is merely a semantic one: "Perhaps we only differ in the meaning of the words Infinity &amp; Eternal."</p>
          <p>In fact, Swedenborg’s view of the two worlds as discrete but connected by correspondence and influx can at times accommodate Blake’s desire for a synthesis of both and at other times appear to contradict it. All depends on which aspect of the Swedenborgian psychic model of the universe is stressed. If the emphasis is on correspondence and influx, then Blake can enthusiastically agree, as in his series of "Mark this" notes in Part V, where the influx of Love is the subject. Such wide areas of agreement prompted Blake to explain away some very real differences between Swedenborg’s world view and his own. Characteristically, he does so by attempting to assimilate Swedenborg’s doctrines into his own: "Heaven &amp; Hell are born together" (E 598); "Good &amp; Evil are here both Good
<pb id="p13-68" n="68"/>
&amp; the two contraries Married" (E 594). As this marriage was in part imposed by Blake upon Swedenborg, divorce, as can be expected in such a case, was imminent.</p>
          <p>In Blake’s works of the late 1780s and early 1790s, the effect of Swedenborg’s doctrines can only be characterized as pervasive.<ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref> Blake freely borrowed from Swedenborg’s system of correspondences, adapting it to the purposes of his own poetry. Thus, as is widely recognized, Swedenborg’s characteristic symbolic imagery appears throughout the <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, and certain characteristic Swedenborgian themes are given expression there.<ref target="n17" type="note">17</ref> One of these themes is the insufficiency of man’s "Proprium," a term glossed by John Clowes as "his own Propriety, or all that he is of himself when separated from Divine Influence. . . ."<ref target="n18" type="note">18</ref> In "The Clod &amp; the Pebble," for example, the Pebble’s view that "Love seeketh only Self to please" is that of the Proprium. A society based on such a view, according to Swedenborg, can maintain only a spurious order masking its own essential destructiveness:
<q>
But the dominion of Self-Love, which is opposite to the Dominion of neighbourly Love, began when Man alienated himself from the Lord; for in proportion as Man doth not love and worship the Lord, in the same Proportion he loves and worships himself, and in the same Proportion also he loves the World: Then it was that, compelled by Motives of Self-Preservation and Security from Injustice, Nations consisting of Families and Houses cemented themselves into one Body, and established Governments under various Forms; for in Proportion as Self-Love increased, in the same Proportion all kinds of Evil, as Enmity, Revenge, Cruelty, and Deceit increased with it, being exercised toward all those who opposed that Love. . . .<ref target="n19" type="note">19</ref></q>
Similarly, Blake writes in "The Human Abstract":
<q>
And mutual fears bring peace;<lb/>
Till the selfish loves increase,<lb/>
Then Cruelty knits a snare,<lb/>
And spreads his baits with care. (E 27)
</q>
Swedenborg’s view of the body politic thus agrees with Blake’s, just as his view of the "vastated" state of the Christian churches does. Other Swedenborgian themes to be found in the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> include the Africans’ direct intuition of the Divine Humanity ("The Little Black Boy")<ref target="n20" type="note">20</ref> and the manifestation of God in a human form as opposed to the idea of a "vapour." Such similarities as these occur equally in <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi>, written after Blake had rejected Swedenborg, as in <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>; as Schorer puts it, "The striking fact about his use of Swedenborg is that he derived . . . the materials for his myth from the dogma that he rejected."<ref target="n21" type="note">21</ref><note id="n16"><hi rend="s">16</hi> On the general subject of Swedenborg’s influence on Blake, see Mark Schorer, <hi rend="i">William Blake: the Politics of Vision</hi> (New York: Vintage, 1959 [Henry Holt, 1946], pp. 93-106; and S.

          <p>Even the idea of two contrary planes of existence, each with its appropriate world of images, can be found in Swedenborg as well as in Blake. Yet there is a significant difference between Swedenborg’s conception of Heaven and Hell and Blake’s of Innocence and Experience. Many of the correspondences employed in Blake’s poems appear, for example, in Swedenborg’s description of Hell:
<q>
None of the pleasing Scenery of Heaven is to be seen there, but all things in direct opposition thereto, inasmuch as the Affections of Love in its inhabitants, which are the Concupiscences of Evil, are directly opposite to the Affections of Love that prevail in the Angels of Heaven. Wherefore amongst the inhabitants of Hell, particularly in their Deserts, there appear Birds of Night, as Bats, and Owls, and likewise Wolves, Leopards, Tigers, Rats, and Mice, with venomous Serpents of all kinds, as Dragons and Crocodiles; and where there is any appearance of Grass, there grow Thorns, Thistles, Briars, and Brambles, and some poisonous Herbs, which at times disappear, and then nothing is to be seen but huge Heaps of Stones, and large Fens full of croaking Frogs. These things also are Correspondences, but then, as was observed, they are Correspondences agreeable to the Affections of Love in the Inhabitants, which are the Concupiscences.<ref target="n22" type="note">22</ref><note id="n22"><hi rend="s">22</hi><hi rend="i"> True Christian Religion</hi>, #78.</note></q>
This paragraph seems like a catalogue of the flora and fauna of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>, but where Swedenborg sees the Affections of Love and their Correspondences to be permanent in Hell, Blake presents his images as symbols of the state of the self at a given point in its development. In "The Little Girl Lost" and "The Little Girl Found," "Lovely Lyca" wanders through a landscape of Innocence "hearing wild birds song," becomes lost in a "desart" at night, and falls asleep; then "the beasts of prey, / Come from caverns deep"; and she is surrounded by lions, leopards, and tygers which carry her naked to their caves. In Swedenborgian terms this lapse from singing birds to beasts of prey, from day to night, from "southern clime" to "desart" would mean a fall from Heaven to Hell. But in Blakean terms Lyca has entered a transitional state in which the passions are experienced and then discovered to be part of a psychic unity. So Lyca’s parents find that there is nothing to fear: the lion is really "a spirit arm’d in gold" and their daughter is safe "among tygers wild." Accepting the life of instinct and emotion,
<q>
To this day they dwell<lb/>
In a lonely dell<lb/>
Nor feel the wolvish howl,<lb/>
Nor the lions growl.<ref target="n23" type="note">23</ref><note id="n23"><hi rend="s">23</hi> E 20-22. Raine mistakenly views these poems as a Neo-Platonic allegory, resulting in a confused interpretation according to which "why Blake chose to substitute a lion for Pluto will be made clear by a further quotation from Macrobius"; when the interpretation breaks down, Blake is seen to be at fault—"In Lyca’s cave it seems as though Blake, in attempting to keep all his multiple meanings in mind simultaneously, has failed at this point." (<hi rend="i">Blake and Tradition</hi>, I, 128-49).</note></q>
Thus, in accordance with his belief that "Good &amp; Evil are here both Good &amp; the two Contraries Married," Blake deliberately corrects Swedenborg. This contrast between their respective uses of correspondences indicates the basis of Blake’s quarrel with Swedenborg’s thought.</p>

Indeed, the section comprising # 322-30 is headed "<hi rend="i">That every Man may be reformed and that there is no such thing as Predestination</hi>"; and Swedenborg even declares "<hi rend="i">That thus all are predestined to Heaven, and none to Hell</hi>" (#329). In order to accuse Swedenborg of being a predestinarian, Blake must interpret <hi rend="i">Divine Providence</hi> in a deliberately hostile sense. <note id="n24"><hi rend="s">24</hi> London: R. Hindmarsh, 1790. Blake’s copy is in the collection of Sir Geoffrey Keynes. This translation is attributed to N. Tucker.</note><note id="n25"><hi rend="s">25</hi> Harold Bloom writes, "Swedenborg’s own later writings affirm predestination and eternal punishment, doctrines abhorrent to Blake" (E 801). Sabri-Tabrizi interprets Swedenborg’s supposed predestinarianism as a projection of his supposed class bias: "According to Swedenborg the social positions of those in ‘Heaven’ and ‘Hell’ are predestined and thus the social relationship is established and fixed." (<hi rend="i">The ‘Heaven’ and ‘Hell’ of William Blake</hi>, p. 83). However, #185 (annotated by Blake) is about <hi rend="i">rich</hi> men who bring hell on themselves.</note></p>
          <p>For Blake the essential problem in Swedenborg’s view is the failure to reconcile man’s free will and God’s foreknowledge. Thus when Swedenborg writes, "But the Man who doth not suffer himself to be led to, and enrolled in Heaven, is prepared for his place in Hell" (#69), Blake asks "What is Enrolling but Predestination?" (E 599). Yet Swedenborg’s "enrolled" is intended to distinguish between divine intention and human will; God intends that all men go to heaven, but some choose Hell. Again, Blake asks of #185 "What could Calvin say more than is said in this Number" (E 599), but Swedenborg’s point here is that honored, worldly men may bring hell on themselves notwithstanding their success in this life. Blake accuses Swedenborg of being a "Spiritual Predestinarian" in #277 because Swedenborg says that "every one also is judged according to his actions, <hi rend="i">not that they are enumerated</hi> [emphasis mine], but because he returns to them. . . ." Blake’s objection seems not to be to predestination as that idea is usually understood, but rather to the disposition of spirits after death. Swedenborg teaches that while a man is alive in the world he also has an "internal" existence in Heaven or Hell and an "external" existence in the world of Spirits between Heaven and Hell. During his life on earth, as a man changes he is correspondingly "translated by the Lord from one Society to another" or "led out of hell and introduced into Heaven"; but after his death, "he remains in that [Society] in which he is according to his Life; wherefore when a man dies, he is inscribed in his own Place" (#307). This is what Blake terms "Predestination" (E 600).</p>
          <p>It is interesting that one of the Swedenborgians’ most formidable critics, Joseph Priestley, far from accusing Swedenborg of Predestinarianism, regards him as an ally who opposes Calvinism as the Unitarians do. Priestly says:
<q>
"[Calvinism is] a system which represents the whole human race as so fatally injured by the sin of Adam, that they retain no natural power of doing the will of God. . . . a system which teaches us that, in order to effect the redemption of a few, God was under a necessity of reversing the known maxims of his conduct, in punishing the innocent instead of the guilty; changing his character of <hi rend="i">gracious</hi> and <hi rend="i">merciful</hi>, into that of an inexorable tyrant. . . . Whereas it is justly observed by Mr. Swedenborg, in his <hi rend="i">Doctrine concerning the Lord</hi>, p. 95, "there is nothing of vindictive justice in God."<ref target="n26" type="note">26</ref><note id="n26"><hi rend="s">26</hi><hi rend="i"> Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church, formed by Baron Swedenborg</hi> (J. Thompson: Birmingham, 1791; sold in London by Joseph Johnson). Priestley’s view that God’s form is "infinite space" (p. 51) would of course have conflicted with Blake’s, while Blake continued to retain the Swedenborgian notion of God’s human form; and in general it can be said that Blake retained numerous Swedenborgian ideas even during the period in which he repudiated Swedenborgianism.</note></q>
If Swedenborg’s Unitarian opponent could say this, how could Blake assert that Swedenborg’s doctrine was "more Abominable than Calvins"? Did Blake misunderstand <hi rend="i">Divine Providence</hi>?</p>
          <p>The answer of course is that he did not: Blake’s annotations to <hi rend="i">Divine Providence</hi> are a rhetorical assault upon Swedenborg, who Blake knows was as far from believing in predestination as any Christian who yet affirms the existence of heaven and hell can be; the whole point is that that is not far enough. Blake is saying that Swedenborg, who opposed the doctrine of predestination, is from a <hi rend="i">Blakean</hi> perspective as much a predestinarian as Calvin. The belief in an omniscient God who created human beings knowing that some of them would choose hell is the common denominator. <hi rend="i">Any</hi> Christian theodicy is to be rejected according to such a view, and Blake is consistent in the early 1790s in rejecting not some but all churches. It is not a view that he would retain consistently—in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> the Arminian Wesley and the Calvinist predestinarian Whitefield are paired as the Christian witnesses foretold in Revelation; presumably Whitefield’s good works and his emphasis on inner regeneration outweighed his theology for Blake at that time.<ref target="n27" type="note">27</ref> But in 1791 Blake was disposed to find the worst in Swedenborg’s doctrines, where previously he had tried to accommodate the differences between his views and Swedenborg’s. One reason for this re-evaulation was no doubt Blake’s growing realization that Swedenborg’s views were in some respects incompatible with his own; at the same time events within the New Jerusalem Church c. 1790-91 almost certainly contributed to Blake’s rejection of Swedenborgianism. <note id="n27"><hi rend="s">27</hi><hi rend="i"> Milton</hi> 22:55-23:2, E 117. See also <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 52, E 199, and 72:51, E 225.</note></p>
          <p>Perhaps the most obvious inference we can draw is that the Revolution that occurred in France just three months after the General Conference sent Blake and the majority of English Swedenborgians in different directions. Blake’s pro-Revolutionary sympathies are too well known to need re-statement here,<ref target="n28" type="note">28</ref> while the New Church was anxious to disassociate itself from political radicalism. At the General Conference of 1791, says Hindmarsh, "a Protest was entered in the Minutes . . . against all such principles of infidelity and democracy as were then circulating in this country,"<ref target="n29" type="note">29</ref> and Paine was specifically attacked. In Birmingham the Church-and-King mob that had destroyed Priestley’s Unitarian chapel (as well as his laboratory and library) went on to the Swedenborgian church; but there the minister, Joseph Proud, told them "that the minister and worshippers were not Unitarians, nor inimical to the Government. A shout was raised—the New Jerusalem for ever, and the crowd dispersed."<ref target="n30" type="note">30</ref> At the same time the Church was incorporating liturgical practices quite opposite to Blake’s view that "The Whole of the New Church is in the Active Life &amp; not in Ceremonies at all" (E 595). At the Second General Conference in April 1790 a catechism for children was prepared, and Joseph Proud’s hymn book was approved along with a form and order of worship. The necessity of living according to the Ten Commandments was also affirmed. At the next year’s General Conference, minister’s garments were approved: "an inner

purple silken vest, and also an outer garment of fine white linen having a golden girdle round the heart."<ref target="n31" type="note">31</ref> Also in 1791 the New Church petitioned Parliament for the right to perform all religious ceremonies, saying they were ready to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy but "without being required to describe themselves as Protestants or Dissenters."<ref target="n32" type="note">32</ref> Furthermore, two dramatic events of 1789-90 must have contributed to Blake’s ironical view of the Swedenborgians as "Angels"—the concubinage dispute and the opening of Swedenborg’s tomb. <note id="n28"><hi rend="s">28</hi> See David V.

          <p>The concubinage dispute has had a shadowy existence in the history of the New Jerusalem Church, for there was an attempt, very nearly successful, to cover up its very existence. The entries for the period 4 May 1789 to 11 April 1790 were torn out of the Minute Book of the Great Eastcheap Society;<ref target="n33" type="note">33</ref> and the subject is not mentioned in Hindmarsh’s <hi rend="i">Rise and Progress</hi> although Hindmarsh himself was expelled from the Society as a result. We know about the dispute only because in 1839 a controversy about which Swedenborgian congregation was the oldest led the Reverend Manoah Sibley to publish his recollections of the early New Jerusalem Church. In the course of his argument, Sibley relates that in 1789
<q>
a very sorrowful occurrence befell the infant New Church, whereby the flood-gates of immorality were in danger of being thrown open to her inevitable destruction. The Church held many solemn meetings on the occasion, which ended in her withdrawing herself from six of her members, viz. Robert Hindmarsh, Henry Servanté, Charles Berns Wadstrom, Augustus Nordenskjold, George Robinson, and Alexander Wilderspin.<ref target="n34" type="note">34</ref></q>
Sibley says no more about the matter except to add that "this grievous circumstance I kept locked up in my own bosom for years." The dispute must nevertheless have attracted considerable attention in Swedenborgian circles at the time, since at least four of the expelled members were prominent, active Swedenborgians. The gist of the controversy concerned Swedenborg’s view of concubinage, as incorporated by Augustus Nordenskjöld into a comprehensive plan of church governance. Nordenskjöld’s complete plan is extant only in Swedish in a little book entitled <hi rend="i">Församlings Formen uti det Nya Jerusalem</hi> (Copenhagen, 1790).<ref target="n35" type="note">35</ref> Part of Nordenskjöld’s proposal was also published in the <hi rend="i">New Jerusalem Magazine</hi> (of which Wadström and Servanté were the editors) in 1790; but the parts about concubinage were left out. The Nordenskjöld plan was presented to at least two meetings of English Swedenborgians and rejected by both, though whether the matter of concubinage was presented is not clear. John Clowes, perhaps the best known of the Swedenborgians who remained within the Church of England at this time, later recalled an occasion when "two Swedish gentlemen" presented to the New Jerusalem Church in London a plan of worship which Clowes found "opposed to every sentiment of propriety, decorum, and common sense of mankind."<ref target="n36" type="note">36</ref> And the minutes of a provincial conference held at Kighley, near Halifax, in 1791 record that "a printed plan for organization, recommended by Frederic Nordenskjöld, Esq." was read and discussed but not accepted.<ref target="n37" type="note">37</ref> Thus the Nordenskjöld plan gained little support in Britain. <note id="n33"><hi rend="s">33</hi> See Thomas Robinson, <hi rend="i">Remembrances of a Recorder</hi> (Manchester and Boston, 1864), p. 94.</note><note id="n34"><hi rend="s">34</hi><hi rend="i"> An Address to the Society of the New Church meeting in Friar Street, near Ludgate Hill, London</hi>, pp. 3-4.</note><note id="n35"><hi rend="s">35</hi> The English equivalent would be "The Form of Organization of the New Jerusalem."

Charles Frederick was in England in 1791, while Augustus left England in that year to take part in the Sierra Leone colony originally projected by Wadström. See Appendix A for further information about A. Nordenskjöld and Wadström.</note></p>
          <p>It must not be thought that Nordenskjöld was primarily concerned with the subject of concubinage—this was only one subject of the many taken up in <hi rend="i">Församlings Formen.</hi> Nordenskjöld’s proposal is a broad plan of religious practice and goverance for the New Church and for civil society as well. It seems to have had its inception in connection with the proposed African colony. Wadström was careful, in presenting his project to the public, not to mention the Swedenborgian concerns behind the project; no doubt he wished to attract the broadest basis of support possible. But those concerns certainly existed, and <hi rend="i">Församlings Formen</hi> appears to be the constitution that the African colony would have had if the Swedenborgians alone had possessed the resources to found it.<ref target="n38" type="note">38</ref> The plan is a relatively democratic one, with all adult members (including women) enfranchised to elect representatives. The body of the presentation comprises first fifty-four numbered paragraphs (pp. 2-34), then "Observations" (pp. 35-52). The section concerning marriage comprises paragraphs 46-54 (pp. 28-34), and the discussion of concubinage forms only part of this section. It was, then, only a small part of Nordenskjöld’s proposal that led to internal dissension in the New Jerusalem Church and subsequently to the expulsion of Nordenskjöld, Wadström, and four others. <note id="n38"><hi rend="s">38</hi> As suggested by Sundelin, p. 261.</note></p>
          <p>Marriage, according to Nordenskjöld, would always be the foundation of the New Jerusalem. The married would be considered as two-thirds of the whole group and would possess five-sixths of the franchise. However, only those marriages in which both man and wife accepted Swedenborg’s doctrines were lawful. If a man were to be baptized into the community and were then to marry a woman who did not accept its beliefs, that man would have to be expelled. Where there was no spiritual union before the Lord, there was no marriage, according to Nordenskjöld, but merely concubinage; yet such merely external unions might be permitted under certain circumstances. Likewise there were situations in which concubinage without marriage was acceptable:
<q>
As it will happen, of course, that for a long time to come there will be unmarried men in our Church who are not able to marry, and married men who have been received among us, but who have unchristian wives, rejecting the New Doctrine, and who thus must live in a disharmonious marriage, it follows that when such men are driven so strongly by the inborn <hi rend="i">amor sexus</hi> that they cannot contain themselves, it is inevitable, for the sake of order, that they be permitted, the former to take a mistress and the latter a concubine. But no one is permitted to live thus in our Church who does not report it to the Bishop or the Marriage-Priest. These are to examine,
<pb id="p13-72" n="72"/>
according to Swedenborg’s rules, <hi rend="i">De Fornicatione et de Concubinato</hi>, if his case is truly such as he presents it. After this he is to receive their written permission, in which the conditions are to be carefully stated, and he may live with his mistress or concubine. If this be observed, he may still be received among us as a dear member and brother, and his life will be no reproach to him. But if he does not report it he must be punished, and this in the degree that his life is disorderly; for no kinds of adulteries or anti-conjugial life can be tolerated in the New Jerusalem if the Church is to continue and the Lord to find an habitation among us.<ref target="n39" type="note">39</ref><note id="n39"><hi rend="s">39</hi> #54, translated by C. T. Odhner and published in his <hi rend="i">Robert Hindmarsh: A Biography</hi> (Philadelphia: Academy Book Room, 1895, pp. 29-30. The rest of <hi rend="i">Församlings Formen</hi> has never been published in English. It is a very rare book; a copy is in the Royal Library, Stockholm.</note></q></p>
          <p>Nordenskjöld’s views were, as he says, based on those of Swedenborg. At the time of the concubinage dispute, the Swedenborgian source, <hi rend="i">Conjugial Love</hi>, was available in complete form only in Latin; the first complete English translation (by John Clowes) was published by Hindmarsh in 1794.<ref target="n40" type="note">40</ref> According to Swedenborg, the "legitimate causes" of concubinage are the same as those of divorce (#488). These causes can be physical, mental, or moral—including among others disease, madness, difference of faith, and adultery. Recognizing that in some instances divorce for these reasons may not be practical or even possible, Swedenborg maintains "That they, who from causes legitimate, just, and really conscientious, are engaged in this concubinage, may be principled at the same time in conjugial love" (#475). This applies only to those who really prefer marriage to concubinage and enter into concubinage for the causes Swedenborg describes as legitimate.<ref target="n41" type="note">41</ref> (Marital intercourse must of course be abandoned.) Thus it can be seen that Nordenskjöld’s views on concubinage are precisely those of Swedenborg, with the introduction only of an institutional mechanism. Many respected followers of Swedenborg in Sweden shared these views, at least in theory; indeed it is hard to see how they could do otherwise, since Swedenborg is so explicit on the subject.<ref target="n42" type="note">42</ref> This no doubt accounts for the presence among those expelled of the conservative Hindmarsh, who certainly did not share Nordenskjöld’s ideas about other aspects of church governance.<ref target="n43" type="note">43</ref><note id="n40"><hi rend="s">40</hi><hi rend="i"> Conjugial Love</hi> (<hi rend="i">De Amore</hi>) is not to be confused with the extract from <hi rend="i">Apocalypsis Explicata</hi> (# 981-1010) published in English as <hi rend="i">A Sketch of the Chaste Delights of Conjugal Love</hi> (London: J. Denew, 1789). Part of <hi rend="i">De Amore</hi> was published in 1790 as <hi rend="i">The Delights of Wisdom Respecting Conjugal Love</hi>, first as a serial in the <hi rend="i">New Jerusalem Magazine</hi>, then as a separate volume; but this edition comprises only # 1-55 and thus does not include the section on concubinage. However, the anonymous Preface does contain what may be an allusion to the concubinage dispute, stating: "In the following work the author likewise proves, in the most satisfactory and clear manner, that true Conjugal Love can only subsist between one husband and one wife, and thus cautions the mind against that dangerous and Antichristian doctrine of a plurality of wives, which has lately been propagated and confirmed from certain passages of the Old Testament falsely understood" (p. iii). This is particularly interesting because the edition is likely to have been the responsibility of either or both the editors of the <hi rend="i">New Jerusalem Magazine</hi>, Henry Servanté and Charles Bernhard Wadström, and both were among those expelled in 1790.</note><note id="n41"><hi rend="s">41</hi> Nevertheless, concubinage never attains the status of marriage in Swedenborg’s view: Concubinage is only "a cloathing, compassing it [conjugial love] round about," and "this cloathing is taken away from them after death" (#475). Neither does Swedenborg seem to have envisioned the possibility of a woman’s taking a male concubine.</note><note id="n42"><hi rend="s">42</hi> See Sundelin, p. 262.</note><note id="n43"><hi rend="s">43</hi> Hindmarsh, though expelled, continued to participate regularly in the meetings for worship of the Great Eastcheap Society until 1792, when he precipitated a new schism on the issue of church hierarchy. Hindmarsh and his few adherents advocated an episcopal system of organization; this was rejected by the majority, but Hindmarsh obtained the lease of their place of worship, and the majority moved to a site in Store Street (near Tottenham Court Road).</note></p>
          <p>Less than a year after the event, the French surgeon Benedict Chastanier, who had been active in Swedenborgian circles since the early days of the Theosophical Society, protested: "No, no, men and brethren, they will never send there [in Heaven’s societies] any letter of exclusion or dismission among them to any of their fellow members, as did not many years ago a certain society, not one hundred miles distant from the monument, to some of its dissentient members, for no other reason than that they were a few degrees deeper grounded in the truth than the rest."<ref target="n44" type="note">44</ref> We can easily conceive how Blake would have regarded the affair. In <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, at least part of which was etched in 1790, the year of the concubinage dispute, Blake proclaims an ethos of libidinal freedom which goes far beyond the narrow doctrinal issues involved in that parochial argument. "The nakedness of woman is the work of God" (E 36) and "He who desires but acts not, breeds pestilence" (E 35) are assertions of the positive goodness of the fulfillment of desire. And in <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> (1793) Blake, through his heroine Oothoon, specifically addresses the question of whether sexual love ought to be limited to the institution of marriage:
<q>
I cry, Love! Love! Love! happy happy Love! free as the mountain wind!<lb/>
Can that be Love, that drinks another as a sponge drinks water?<lb/>
That clouds with jealousy his nights, with weepings all the day:<lb/>
To spin a web of age around him. grey and hoary! dark!<lb/>
Till his eyes sicken at the fruit that hangs before his sight.<lb/>
Such is self-love that envies all! a creeping skeleton<lb/>
With lamplike eyes watching around the frozen marriage bed.<lb/><lb/>
But silken nets and traps of adamant will Oothoon spread,<lb/>
And catch for thee girls of mild silver, or of furious gold;<lb/>
I’ll lie beside thee on a bank &amp; view their wanton play<lb/>
In lovely copulation bliss on bliss with Theotormon:<lb/>
Red as the rosy morning, lustful as the first born beam,<lb/>
Oothoon shall view his dear delight, nor e’er with jealous cloud<lb/>
Come in the heaven of generous love; nor selfish blightings bring. (E 49)
</q>
Doctrines such as these sharply distinguish Blake’s views about sex even from those of the expelled Swedenborgians, with one possible exception. Augustus Nordenskjöld was reputed to have carried out in life what the others merely maintained in theory, and is said to have maintained as his justification that Swedenborg himself had had a mistress while in Italy.<ref target="n45" type="note">45</ref> Blake himself was the subject of an unattributed story that, according to Mona Wilson, "he proposed to add a concubine to his household."<ref target="n46" type="note">46</ref> Whether or not the story has any basis, the concubinage dispute must have made Blake all the more aware of the gap that separated him from the majority of English Swedenborgians. <note id="n44"><hi rend="s">44</hi><hi rend="i"> Emanuel Swedenborg’s New-Years Gift to His Readers for MDCCXCI</hi>, p. 21.

Another account to this effect was published in the <hi rend="i"> Appendix to the New Jerusalem Magazine</hi> (1791), p. 263. According to General Tuxen of Denmark, Swedenborg had proposed marriage early in life to the daughter of his superior, the engineer Polhem, but she had refused him. "I then enquired, whether in his youth he could keep free from temptations with regard to the sex? He replied, not altogether; In my youth I had a mistress in Italy."</note><note id="n46"><hi rend="s">46</hi><hi rend="i"> The Life of William Blake</hi>, ed.

          <p>A second dramatic event occurred among Swedenborgians c. 1790—the opening of Swedenborg’s tomb. The most detailed source of information about the first opening—for the tomb was opened a second time shortly afterwards—is an account by Gustav Broling, a Swedish metallurgist and a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences who lived in England from 1797 to 1799.<ref target="n47" type="note">47</ref> His account is second-hand but it agrees in most respects with shorter reports by Robert Hindmarsh and by J. I. Hawkins. According to Broling, an American physician who was enthusiastic about Swedenborg’s writings came to London for the purpose of proving that Swedenborg was not really in his coffin but rather "must have been removed thence in some extraordinary manner." With the help of "a follower and countryman of Swedenborg, still famous at that time,"<ref target="n48" type="note">48</ref> the American, accompanied by ten or twelve "New Jerusalemites," penetrated the vault of the Swedish Church. Swedenborg’s casket was opened, but turned out to contain a second, which in turn contained a lead coffin. A solderer was brought in to cut through the lead covering. What followed is worthy of one of Blake’s Memorable Fancies: "But there now issued forth effluvia in such abundance and of such a sort that the candles went out, and all the observers were obliged to rush head over heels out of the burial vault in order not to be smothered." The investigators were, however, persistent.
<q>
The candles [Broling continues] were relighted—the church was fumigated with vinegar—the windows opened—and once more a descent was made to continue the investigation. It was found that Swedenborg’s remains really still lay in the coffin, without any special ravages of time, which, deprived of the assistance of the air, had not greatly changed the features of the face. It was observed as a peculiar fact, and perhaps not without reason, that the half of the face nearest the wall of the vault preserved its almost natural roundness. But as to whether this examination, for the rest, strengthened or weakened the Doctor’s faith, of that Tradition does not say a single word.
</q>
A basically similar report of these events was published by J. I. Hawkins in <hi rend="i">The Times</hi> for 24 April 1823. According to Hawkins, however, the instigator was a learned Swede:
<q>
About the year 1790, a Swedish philosopher, then in London, who was a great admirer of Swedenborg’s philosophical writings but had no relish for the theological, became acquainted with some of the members of the New Church, and warmly opposed Swedenborg’s tenet that the soul takes a final leave of the material body at death, and enters on a new scene of superior activity in a spiritual body, more suited to obey its energies. The learned Swede endeavored to persuade them, that all great philosophers had, by virtue of their profound wisdom, the power of taking with them, into the world of spirits, their natural bodies; and he asserted his full conviction, that Swedenborg, whom he considered one of the first philosophers, had taken away his body out of the coffin.<ref target="n49" type="note">49</ref></q>
C. T. Odhner identifies the Swedish philosopher as the poet and critic Thomas Thorild, but there does not appear to be any evidence for this.<ref target="n50" type="note">50</ref> Thorild was indeed in London from 1788 to 1790, and in 1790 Robert Hindmarsh published Thorild’s <hi rend="i">True Heavenly Religion Restored</hi>, with the author identified only as "a Philosopher of the North." However, Thorild’s book is a pro-Swedenborgian polemic which in no way can be made to conform to Hawkins’ description of the instigator as someone who did not admire Swedenborg’s theological writings. On the contrary, Thorild concludes "that this true and Divine Religion is, as to the general Character, even that of Emanuel Swedenborg: Who, if God, Spirits, a Religion, be at all—has certainly brought us sublime Revelations, and may be considered as a Prophet of a third rising Covenant, or that of <hi rend="i">open Truth</hi>" (p. 119). <note id="n47"><hi rend="s">47</hi><hi rend="i"> Antechningar under en resa i England</hi> (Stockholm, 1811), I, 47.

Although Dr. Hultkrantz’s conclusions concerning Swedenborg’s skull were subsequently refuted (see Folke Henschen, "Emanuel Swedenborg’s Cranium: a Critical Analysis," <hi rend="i">Nova Acta Regiae Societas Scientarum Upsaliensis</hi>, ser. IV, XVII, No. 9, 1960), this does not affect our discussion of the first two openings of the tomb, the skull having been removed at a later date. See Appendix C.</note><note id="n48"><hi rend="s">48</hi> This person is identified by Hultkrantz, without any indication as to evidence, as probably either Wadström or Augustus Nordenskjöld.</note><note id="n49"><hi rend="s">49</hi> Reprinted, with other material concerning the openings of the tomb, by David Geroge Goyder, <hi rend="i">The Autobiography of a Phrenologist</hi> (London: Simkin, Marshall, 1857), p. 136.

          <p>Yet a third minor variant is provided by Robert Hindmarsh, who says that the instigator was not a Swedenborgian at all but "a foreign gentleman who held the absurd tenets of the sect of Rosicrucians." At a dinner at the house of a Swedenborgian, the Rosicrucian declared that Swedenborg had discovered an elixir by which he could "protract his existence as long as he pleased." Then, "desirous to put off the infirmities of age, [he] had renewed his existence and withdrawn to some other part of the world, causing a sham funeral to be performed to avoid discovery." This then led to the opening of the tomb and the discovery of Swedenborg’s remains therein. Although the three sources differ as to how the opening of the tomb was instigated, they agree in presenting the investigation as a test of whether Swedenborg’s body possessed some magical property that would have removed it from the coffin altogether—a test which culminated in the discovery that Swedenborg’s mortal remains were like anyone elses’s. The experiment was then repeated a few days later by Hindmarsh and four or five associates. They found the corpse in a very good state of preservation: "The features were still perfect, the flesh firm," says Hindmarsh; but when he placed his hand on the forehead, he found that "the lower part of the nose gave indications of approaching decomposition." No doubt as a result of its exposure to air, the body was "afterwards found . . . speedily being reduced to ashes."<ref target="n51" type="note">51</ref> These two openings of the tomb, the first witnessed by perhaps a dozen people and the second by five or six new spectators, can hardly have been kept secret. <note id="n51"><hi rend="s">51</hi><hi rend="i"> Rise and Progress</hi>, p. 399.</note></p>
          <p><hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> is widely recognized to be a satire directed toward Swedenborg and the Swedenborgians.<ref target="n52" type="note">52</ref> The title unites what Swedenborg had perceived as divided; Angels and Devils are juxtaposed, but with subversive intent.

matter-of-factly, sudden transitions are made from one world to another, and the narrator always has the last word. Even the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> of the title may be an ironical allusion to Swedenborg, for in <hi rend="i">A Sketch of the Chaste Delights of Conjugal Love</hi> Swedenborg asserts:
<q>
That Hell is formed from Adulteries, is because Adultery is from the Marriage of Evil and False, from which Hell in its whole Complex is called Adultery; and that Heaven is formed from Marriages, is because Marriage is from the Marriage of Good and Truth, whence also Heaven in its whole complex is called a Marriage. . . .

This arrogation of libidinal energy to "Evil" and of passive restraint to "Good" is corrected by Blake throughout <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.</hi> Of course <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> is much more than an anti-Swedenborgian polemic, but its full significance can only be appreciated in the light of Blake’s knowledge of Swedenborg’s doctrines and of the history of the New Jerusalem Church. <note id="n52"><hi rend="s">52</hi> See Martin K.

The first reference is of course to Swedenborg’s declaration that a new heaven was opened in 1757,<ref target="n54" type="note">54</ref> and the second sentence alludes to the episode in John xx where Christ’s body is found to be gone. from the tomb:
<q>
So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. (4-7)
</q>
For Blake the body of Christ’s teaching is absent from Swedenborg’s writings; the latter are seen as a garment which can be discarded. As Damon remarks, "Swedenborg finds himself left behind in his own eschatology."<ref target="n55" type="note">55</ref> The reader conversant with the circumstances surrounding the openings of Swedenborg’s tomb could have seen a further ironical allusion here. Unlike Christ, Swedenborg was securely in his tomb when his followers came seeking him. Such a contrast is of course unfair to Swedenborg, who never claimed any extraordinary powers for his mortal body; but Blake’s purpose here is to expose what he perceives as the errors of Swedenborgianism rather than to do justice to Swedenborg as a historical figure. <note id="n54"><hi rend="s">54</hi><hi rend="i"> A Treatise Concerning the Last Judgment</hi> (London: R.

          <p>Blake’s fourth Memorable Fancy both attacks Swedenborg’s doctrine and parodies his techniques. The author’s journey through visionary worlds is of course a familiar feature of Swedenborg’s writings. When Leviathan is perceived "to the east, distant about three degrees," we are meant to recall Swedenborg’s precise readings of the celestial map: for example, the Sun "appears above the Earths which the Angels inhabit, in an Elevation of about forty-five Degrees. . . ."<ref target="n56" type="note">56</ref> The interplanetary voyage with Swedenborg’s volumes in hand imitates the similar ones in <hi rend="i">Earths in Our Solar System</hi>, while the discussion of "my eternal lot" refers to the "enrolling" of <hi rend="i">Divine Providence.</hi> When Blake tells the Angel "Here . . . is your lot, in this space, if space it may be called," he reminds us of Swedenborg’s statement that "the Spaces and Distances, and consequent Progressions, which occur in the natural World, are in their Origin and first Cause, Changes of the State of Interior things. . . ."<ref target="n57" type="note">57</ref> Subsequently, Blake "in my hand brought forth the skeleton of a body, which in the mill was Aristotles Analytics"; in <hi rend="i">Earths in Our Solar System</hi> Aristotle is described sympathetically, and Swedenborg says, "Afterwards I discoursed with him, concerning the analytic science. . . ."<ref target="n58" type="note">58</ref> In the fifth Memorable Fancy, where the converted Angel "stretched out his arms embracing the flame of fire &amp; he was consumed and arose as Elijah," there also appears to be a Swedenborgian source; for on Jupiter, according to Swedenborg, "the Spirits of that Earth, when they are prepared, are taken up into Heaven and become Angels: On such occasions there appear Chariots and bright Horses as of Fire, by which they are carried away in like Manner as Elias. . . ."<ref target="n59" type="note">59</ref> In instances such as these, Blake uses Swedenborgian material to intensify the irony of his anti-Swedenborgian satire. <note id="n56"><hi rend="s">56</hi> E. 40; <hi rend="i">Divine Love and Divine Wisdom</hi>, #104.</note><note id="n57"><hi rend="s">57</hi> E. 41; <hi rend="i">Earths in Our Solar System</hi>, #125.</note><note id="n58"><hi rend="s">58</hi> E. 41; <hi rend="i">Earths in Our Solar System</hi>, #38.</note><note id="n59"><hi rend="s">59</hi> E. 42; <hi rend="i">Earths in Our Solar System</hi>, #82.</note></p>
          <p>Of the many other Swedenborgian allusions in <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>, several are worth particular attention. "Some will say," Blake writes, "Is not God alone the Prolific? I answer, God only Acts &amp; Is, in existing beings or Men."<ref target="n60" type="note">60</ref> This seems to be aimed explicitly at Swedenborg’s admonition in <hi rend="i">Divine Love and Divine Wisdom</hi>: "Let every one beware of falling into that execrable Heresy, that God hath infused himself into Men, and that he is in them, and no longer in himself."<ref target="n61" type="note">61</ref> The invidious comparison of Swedenborg to Paracelsus and Boehme takes on an added significance when we note that Swedenborg explicitly denied having read Boehme, and that this denial was published in the <hi rend="i">New Jerusalem Magazine</hi> early in 1790. Thus when Blake says that "Swedenborgs writings are a recapitulation of all superficial opinions, and an analysis of the more sublime," he is probably playing on Swedenborg’s assertion that "I was prohibited reading dogmatic and systematic theology, before heaven was opened to me. . . ."<ref target="n62" type="note">62</ref> More generally, the erotic mysticism of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> can be seen in one aspect as Blake’s response to the concubinage dispute—not that it is in any way limited to that meaning. Just as Berkeley’s <hi rend="i">Siris</hi> begins as a disquisition on tar-water and becomes a statement about the nature of the universe, so <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>, in its inception an anti-Swedenborgian satire, develops into Blake’s most comprehensive statement about human existence up to the time of its composition. <note id="n60"><hi rend="s">60</hi> E. 39.</note><note id="n61"><hi rend="s">61</hi> #125.</note><note id="n62"><hi rend="s">62</hi> E. 42; <hi rend="i">New Jerusalem Magazine</hi>, p. 73.</note></p>

          <p>For about a decade following the beginning of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>, there is little to indicate Swedenborgian interests in Blake’s poetry and art. Then, from about the turn of the century and well into the nineteenth century, Blake displays a renewed interest in (though by no means a simple attitude toward) Swedenborg. Perhaps the most dramatic instance of this interest may be seen in Blake’s <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> of 1809. Among the sixteen pictures that Blake chose to show in his exhibition in that year was one, now unfortunately lost, on a Swedenborgian subject. Its title was "The spiritual Preceptor, an experiment Picture," and it was based on a Memorable Relation in <hi rend="i">True Christian Religion.</hi> According to Blake:
<q>
This subject is taken from the visions of Emanuel Swedenborg. Universal Theology, No. 623. The Learned, who strive to ascend into Heaven by means of learning, appear to Children like dead horses, when repelled by the celestial spheres. The works of this visionary are well worthy the attention on of Painters and Poets; they are foundations for grand things; the reason they have not been more attended to, is, because corporeal demons have gained a predominance; who the leaders of these are, will be shewn below. Unworthy Men who gain fame among Men, continue to govern mankind after death, and in their spiritual bodies, oppose the spirits of those, who worthily are famous; and as Swedenborg observes, by entering into disease and excrement, drunkenness and concupiscence, they possess themselves of the bodies of mortal men, and shut the doors of mind and of thought, by placing Learning above Inspiration. O Artist! you may disbelieve all this, but it shall be at your own peril.<ref target="n63" type="note">63</ref><note id="n63"><hi rend="s">63</hi> E 537. <hi rend="i">Universal Theology</hi> is the alternative title for <hi rend="i">True Christian Religion.</hi> An almost identical anecdote is related in <hi rend="i">Apocalypse Revealed</hi>, #311.</note></q>
The "experiment picture" may of course have been executed years before the exhibition, but these comments in Blake’s <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> reveal a strong renewal of interest in Swedenborg by 1809. Another picture which indicates such interest is <hi rend="i">The Death of the Good Old Man</hi>, engraved after Blake by Schiavonetti for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> (1808).<ref target="n64" type="note">64</ref> In this design, the soul of the Good Old Man, identical in appearance to his dead body, is escorted upwards by angels. As H. W. Janson points out with respect to Flaxman, such a depiction of the "full-bodied soul" immediately after death is based on a Swedenborgian conception: "Man rises again immediately after death, and he then appears to himself in a body just as in this world, with a similar face, members, arms, hands, feet, breast, belly, and loins; so that when he sees and touches himself, he says that he is a man as in the world."<ref target="n65" type="note">65</ref> Janson argues that such a portrayal of the "full-bodied soul" is to be distinguished from the depiction of the soul at the Last Judgment, when all shall be resurrected. As we know, Blake and Flaxman influenced each other in many ways, and it is possible that <hi rend="i">The Death of the Good Old Man</hi> derives from such funerary sculptures as Flaxman’s Agnes Cromwell monument in Chichester Cathedral. Nevertheless, given the wide extent of Blake’s reading of Swedenborg, he would have known that in <hi rend="i">The Death of the Good Old Man</hi> he was using a specifically Swedenborgian idea. <note id="n64"><hi rend="s">64</hi> For a detailed discussion of this design, see Robert N. Essick and Morton D. Paley, <hi rend="i">Robert Blair’s "The Grave" with the Illustrations of William Blake</hi> (London: the Scolar Press, forthcoming).</note><note id="n65"><hi rend="s">65</hi> H.

The quotation is from <hi rend="i">Arcana coelestia</hi> #5078, but the idea is encountered frequently in Swedenborg’s writings. I am indebted to Dr. David Bindman for calling Janson’s article to my attention.</note></p>
          <p>One source of Blake’s renewed interest in Swedenborg may have been his friendship with Charles Augustus Tulk, son of a founding member of the New Jerusalem Church and also a friend of Flaxman’s and of Coleridge’s.<ref target="n66" type="note">66</ref> It was Tulk’s copy of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> that Coleridge borrowed in February 1818, and it was probably information from Tulk that led Coleridge to write of Blake, "He is a man of Genius—and I apprehend, a Swedenborgian."<ref target="n67" type="note">67</ref> In the memoir which Tulk’s daughter dictated to his grand-daughter, it is said that "William Blake, the Poet &amp; Painter, with his wife, were rescued from destitution by Mr. C. A. Tulk, &amp; became much impressed with the Spiritual Truths in Swedenborg’s Writings. He made drawings from the Memorable Relations, one of them of a female Angel instructing a number of children in the spiritual world."<ref target="n68" type="note">68</ref> Unfortunately, this drawing is not known to exist today; nor is a picture which is said to have had a marginal note in Blake’s hand recommending Swedenborg’s <hi rend="i">Worship and Love of God</hi>, a work first published in complete English translation in 1799-1801.<ref target="n69" type="note">69</ref> Despite the fact that Blake’s pictures on Swedenborgian subjects either have not survived or have not been identified, it is clear from the evidence we have cited that Swedenborg had once more assumed major importance to Blake by 1809. We can find this interest reflected in Blake’s poetic works as well. <note id="n66"><hi rend="s">66</hi> On Tulk, see <hi rend="i">DNB, s. v.</hi>; Geoffrey Keynes, "Blake, Tulk, and Garth Wilkinson," <hi rend="i">The Library</hi>, 4th ser., XXVI (1945), 190-92; and Raymond A.

According to Crabb Robinson, "He was invited to join the Swedenborgians under Proud, but declined, notwithstanding his high opinion of Swedenborg. . . . "—<hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, p. 452, from "William Blake," <hi rend="i">Vaterländisches Museum</hi>, I (January 1811), 107-31.

However, the Catalogue of the British Fine Arts Club Exhibition of 1876 (in which exhibition Morris claims the picture was shown) indicates no such detail.</note></p>
          <p>One of the most striking instances of Swedenborgian conceptions in Blake’s later work occurs in plate 48 of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> Here the condition of man has fallen to its lowest point; on the preceding plate, Albion speaks his last words—"Hope is banish’d from me" (E 194). Then the Saviour receives Albion and in mercy reposes his limbs on the Rock of Ages.

As Damon was the first to point out, these books of the Bible—thirty-three in all—are precisely those which Swedenborg had declared possessed the internal sense of the Word; and as Bentley has noted, the General Conference of 1789 re-affirmed that only these were the "Books of the Word."<ref target="n71" type="note">71</ref> It cannot be a coincidence that Blake chose these
<pb id="p13-79" n="79"/>
books to form that canopy that would shield the sleeping body of man while the work of redemption took place. Blake’s notion of Albion the Eternal Man is itself derived from Swedenborg, who conceives of the three Heavens as composing a Grand Man, with the various human members and organs having their corresponding celestial parts. This doctrine was probably first encountered by Blake in <hi rend="i">Heaven and Hell</hi> (#59-67), but it does not appear in his own work until <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>—which is to say, no earlier than the late 1790s. This analogy of the human microcosm with a human macrocosm provided Blake, as Schorer puts it, with "the metaphorical tool that enabled him to counter the prevailing mechanical view of man and the universe with his own organic view."<ref target="n72" type="note">72</ref> These important debts to Swedenborg are well established, but others scarcely less important have not previously been discussed. <note id="n71"><hi rend="s">71</hi> Damon, <hi rend="i">William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols</hi>, p. 454, citing <hi rend="i">Arcana Coelestia</hi>, X, #325; Bentley, "Blake and Swedenborg, <hi rend="i">Notes and Queries</hi>, CXCIX (N.S. I, 1954), 264-65.</note><note id="n72"><hi rend="s">72</hi><hi rend="i"> William Blake: The Politics of Vision</hi>, p. 96.</note></p>
          <p>The central action of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, the redemptive descent of Milton to "Eternal Death" to deliver the sleeping body of man, is in part an amplification and revision of a Swedenborgian doctrine. In his great speech on plate 14, Milton says:
<q>
I in my Selfhood am that Satan: I am that Evil One!<lb/>
He is my Spectre! in obedience to loose him from my Hells<lb/>
To claim the Hells, my Furnaces, I go to Eternal Death.<ref target="n73" type="note">73</ref><note id="n73"><hi rend="s">73</hi><hi rend="i"> Milton</hi> 14:30-32, E 107.</note></q>
In <hi rend="i">True Christian Religion</hi> Swedenborg says that the Last Judgment of 1757 involved "the Subduing of the Hells, restoring the Heavens to Order, and establishing a new Church" (#115); and elsewhere he asserts "That the Lord was to come into the World, to accomplish a complete or final Judgement, and thereby subjugate the then prevailing power of the Hells, which was effected by Spiritual Combats, or Temptations admitted to assault the Humanity derived from the Mother, and by continual victories then obtained. . . ."<ref target="n74" type="note">74</ref> Blake’s Milton likewise triumphs over temptations and assaults "in conflict with those Female forms"<ref target="n75" type="note">75</ref> (his wives and daughters), striving with the demon Urizen and his codes of Law, tempted by the sons and daughters of Rahab and Tirzah. Milton’s sublime act has as its paradigm the Incarnation, and there are parallels in Plato’s fable of the Cave and in Gnostic mythology; but in Swedenborg and in Blake we also find a plurality of hells and a putting off of the Maternal Humanity. The latter feature also appears in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>: "by his Maternal Birth he [Christ] is that Evil-One / And his Maternal Humanity must be put off Eternally" (90:35-36, E 247). Swedenborg declares "That the Lord Successively put off the humanity which was taken from the Mother, and put on the humanity from the Divinity in Himself, which is the Divine Humanity and the Son of God."<ref target="n76" type="note">76</ref> For Blake the Maternal Humanity was the purely material aspect of Christ’s being; this must be "put off" so that he may "put on" his spiritual body. <note id="n74"><hi rend="s">74</hi><hi rend="i"> The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Concerning the Lord</hi> (London: R. Hindmarsh, 3rd ed., 1791), #3.</note><note id="n75"><hi rend="s">75</hi> 17:7, E 109.</note><note id="n76"><hi rend="s">76</hi><hi rend="i"> New Jerusalem</hi>, #35.</note></p>
          <p>Blake and Swedenborg also share a similar conception of history according to which "Churches" succeed one another, each reaching its "period" and

then giving way to its successor. As Damon suggests, Blake’s use of Biblical names to denote the Churches of history derives from Swedenborg,<ref target="n77" type="note">77</ref> but in addition the idea of a crisis in the modern Church leading to its "Consummation" is also common to both. In <hi rend="i">Divine Providence</hi>, Swedenborg describes the process by which this happens, declaring, "But the successive Vastation of the Christian Church in it’s final Period, is described by the Lord in Matthew Chap. xxiv, in Mark, Chap. xiii, and in Luke, Chap. xxi; and the Consummation itself in the Apocalypse."<ref target="n78" type="note">78</ref> This theme was sounded at the opening of the General Conference of 1789, where an extract from <hi rend="i">True Christian Religion</hi> was read, asserting "that the Christian Church, which is founded on the Word, and is now at it’s Period, may again revive and derive Spirit through Heaven from the Lord."<ref target="n79" type="note">79</ref> In <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, Blake both appropriates and subverts the Swedenborgian idea.
<q>
Seeing the Churches at their Period in terror &amp; despair:<lb/>
Rahab created Voltair; Tirzah created Rousseau;<lb/>
Mocking the Confessors &amp; Martyrs, claiming Self-righteousness;<lb/>
With cruel Virtue: making War upon the Lambs Redeemed<ref target="n80" type="note">80</ref></q>
For Blake the "Period" of the Churches culminates in the consolidation of the rationalistic system which he calls Deism; this necessarily precedes a Last Judgment in which history will be abolished. Swedenborg conceived the New Church to be the result of the vastation of the Christian Church, but Blake perceives Swedenborg himself as the victim of the Churches of history—as the passage in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> goes on to say:
<q>
O Swedenborg! strongest of men, the Samson shorn by the Churches!<lb/>
Shewing the Transgressors in Hell, the proud Warriors in Heaven:<lb/>
Heaven as a Punisher &amp; Hell as One under Punishment:<lb/>
With Laws from Plato &amp; his Greeks to renew the Trojan Gods,<lb/>
In Albion; &amp; to deny the value of the Saviours blood.<ref target="n81" type="note">81</ref></q>
This is essentially the same criticism Blake made in <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>: that Swedenborg, in accepting the necessity of repressive law and in re-affirming the existence of an afterlife of rewards and punishments, committed the same errors that the Churches had. But Swedenborg is no longer demeaned as "A man [who] carried a monkey about for a shew, &amp; because he was a little wiser than the monkey . . . conceiv’d himself as much wiser than seven men" (E 42). Instead, he is the "strongest of men," the shorn Samson whose tragic fate indicates something of Blake’s profound ambivalence toward Swedenborg at this point. <note id="n77"><hi rend="s">77</hi><hi rend="i"> William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols</hi>, p. 427. Briefly Swedenborg postulates five Churches in history, beginning with Adam and Eve. Second comes "the Ancient Church," described by Noah, his three sons and their posterity. Heber, eponymous founder of the Hebrew Church, instituted sacrificial worship. The Word was written under the Israelitish and Jewish Church. (Heber and the Israelitish Church are at times combined into one by Swedenborg). These four Old Testament Churches are represented by Nebuchadnezzar’s dream in Dan. ii. 32,33. The fifth Church is the Christian Church. "And it may be seen from the Word, that all these Churches in Process of Time declined, till there was an End of them, which is called the Consummation." <hi rend="i">Divine Providence</hi>, #328.</note><note id="n78"><hi rend="s">78</hi><hi rend="i"> Divine Providence</hi>, #328.</note><note id="n79"><hi rend="s">79</hi><hi rend="i"> Minutes</hi>, ed.

          <p>Another Swedenborgian idea which finds itself into Blake’s later work is the special meaning attached to Great Tartary. In <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> when Urizen builds his "Mighty Temple," we are told that "his inmost hall is Great Tartary"; and one of the activities of those who consummate bliss and are generated on Earth is "Viewing the Winding Worm on the Desarts of Great Tartary."<ref target="n82" type="note">82</ref> Commentators have generally taken "Great Tartary" to be a geopolitical symbol signifying the eastern part of the world: thus the Winding Worm on the deserts of Great Tartary has been interpreted as the advance of Napoleon’s armies into Russia.<ref target="n83" type="note">83</ref> But <hi rend="i">Great</hi> Tartary—as distinguished from Crimean Tartary—was in Asia,<ref target="n84" type="note">84</ref> and of course Napoleon did not attack Asiatic Russia. In order to understand the symbolism of these passages, we must turn to Swedenborg, who in <hi rend="i">True Christian Religion</hi> maintains the existence of a Word which existed before the Word which the World now possesses. Speaking of "that ancient Word, which was in Asia before the Israelitish Word," he asserts "It is still preserved amongst the People who live in Great Tartary. . . ."<ref target="n85" type="note">85</ref> These people, he goes on, have the Book of Jasher (mentioned in Joshua x. 12,13 and in II Samuel i. 17,18) and the Wars of Jehovah and the Denunciators (the last, according to Swedenborg, being mistranslated as "Composers of Proverbs" in our Bibles). Thus we can see why Great Tartary should be the <hi rend="i">inmost</hi> hall of Urizen’s Temple of Urizen, representing as it does the primordial Word. Again, the reference to the warrior’s spear and sword reaching "from Albion to Great Tartary" indicates that even the wisdom of the ancient Word is threatened by the modern code of love and war. When those who consummate bliss regard the generated world, they see an aspect of themselves in the Winding Worm reaching to Great Tartary: the Worm of mortality, whose winding also suggests the cycle of history, is seen inhabiting the place of the world’s ancient wisdom and presumably corrupting it. Blake’s meaning in all three of these instances is particularized by its Swedenborgian reference. <note id="n82"><hi rend="s">82</hi> 58:36, E 206; 86:46, E 243. In a third, less important reference, the warrior who beholds the beauty of the daughter of Albion is smitten, and "his spear / And sword faint in his hand, from Albion to Great Tartary" (68:51-52, E 220).</note><note id="n83"><hi rend="s">83</hi> Erdman, <hi rend="i">Blake: Prophet</hi>, pp. 464, 466.

          <p>Numerous other examples of references to Swedenborg may be found in Blake’s late writings and conversation, but only a few especially interesting examples need be mentioned here. The vortices which figure prominently in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> and in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> are likely to have come to Blake via Swedenborg; though their ultimate source is Descartes,<ref target="n86" type="note">86</ref> it is unlikely that Blake read the Cartesian account directly.

          <p>It is easy to see the reason for Blake’s ambivalence toward Swedenborg. A seer of visions and the Messenger of a new age, Swedenborg was yet, for Blake, bound within the same limits that confined other founders of "Churches." Whitefield and Wesley were preferable not necessarily because of their doctrines, but because of the active nature of their ministry. Blake appears to have expressed his attitude rather diplomatically to Charles Augustus Tulk. According to Dr. J. J. Garth Wilkinson
<q>
Blake informed Tulk that he had two different states; one in which he liked Swedenborg’s writings, and one in which he disliked them. The second was a state of pride in himself, and then they were distasteful to him, but afterwards he knew that he had not been wise and sane. The first was a state of humility, in which he received and accepted Swedenborg.<ref target="n93" type="note">93</ref><note id="n93"><hi rend="s">93</hi> James Spilling, "Blake the Visionary," <hi rend="i">New Church Magazine</hi>, VI (1887), 210.</note></q>
Blake’s remarks to Crabb Robinson on the same subject were considerably less circumspect. "He was a divine teacher," Robinson reports Blake as saying of Swedenborg in 1825, and continues:
<q>
—he has done much and will do much good he has correct<hi rend="s">d</hi> many errors of Popery &amp; also of
<pb id="p13-83" n="83"/>
Luther &amp; Calvin—Yet he also said that <hi rend="i">Swedenborg</hi> was wrong in endeavour<hi rend="s">g</hi> to explain to the <hi rend="i">rational</hi> faculty what the reason cannot comprehend he should have left that—As B. mentioned <hi rend="i">Swedenb</hi>: &amp; Dante together I wished to know whe<hi rend="s">r</hi> he considered their visions of the same kind As far as I co<hi rend="s">d</hi> collect he does—<ref target="n94" type="note">94</ref><note id="n94"><hi rend="s">94</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Records</hi>, p. 312.</note></q>
A further reflection recorded by Robinson reads: "<hi rend="i">Swedenborg</hi> Parts of his scheme are dangerous. His sexual religion is dangerous."<ref target="n95" type="note">95</ref> "Sexual" in Blake’s later vocabulary has the special meaning of something’s becoming materialized and in so doing betraying its essential quality, and so here again Blake is concentrating on that aspect of Swedenborgianism which he sees as resembling historical Christianity—complete with angels, devils, an afterlife with rewards and punishments, and a church. In his last known comment on Swedenborg, it is once more this aspect which Blake vehemently attacks. On the back of Dante design 7, showing Homer at the center of a diagram of the universe, Blake condemns Dante as a worshipper of Nature, adding "Swedenborg does the same in saying that this World is the Ultimate of Heaven" (E 668). Perhaps Blake might have more correctly told Tulk that in one state he regarded Swedenborg’s visions metaphorically, and then they seemed consistent with his own; while in the other state he viewed them literally and as conflicting with his own. In the former state, he tended to regard his disagreements with Swedenborg merely as a matter of Swedenborg’s not having gone far enough; in the latter, he condemned Swedenborg for the same reason. In this divided attitude, Blake resembles another great Romantic, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson, like Blake, accuses Swedenborg of over-literalism, "Hebraism," and want of poetry; and like Blake Emerson compares Swedenborg unfavorably with Boehme, who, says Emerson, "is healthily and beautifully wise."<ref target="n96" type="note">96</ref> Emerson’s remarks on Swedenborg’s angels are consonant with Blake’s in <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>: "They are all country parsons: their heaven is a <hi rend="i">fête champêtre</hi>, an evangelical picnic, or a French distribution of prizes to virtuous peasants."<ref target="n97" type="note">97</ref> Yet in the book where these remarks occur, <hi rend="i">Representative Men</hi>, Emerson chooses Swedenborg as his example of "The Mystic." Likewise for Blake, Swedenborg, the Angel sitting at the Tomb, the Samson shorn by the Churches, is a powerful visionary figure of pervasive interest. <note id="n95"><hi rend="s">95</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Records</hi>, p. 313.</note><note id="n96"><hi rend="s">96</hi><hi rend="i"> Representative Men: Seven Lectures</hi> (Boston: Phillips, Sampson, 1850), p. 142.</note><note id="n97"><hi rend="s">97</hi> Pp. 141-42.</note></p>

              <p>Blake had ample opportunity to meet these two extraordinary figures at the General Conference of 1789, and, given the congruence of some of their interests with his, it is appropriate that we give some further information about each.</p>
              <p>Nordenskjöld was born in Finland in 1754 and was educated at Åbo Akademi. He then moved to Stockholm, where he was active as a chemist, mineralogist, and alchemist. In 1779 he made his first trip to England, wrote part of <hi rend="i">A Plain System of Alchymy</hi>, and discovered and published the manuscript of Swedenborg’s <hi rend="i">Coronis.</hi> Returning to Sweden in 1780, Nordenskjöld embarked on a series of secret experiments at Drottningholm under the sponsorship of Gustav III, to produce gold by alchemical means. (According to Tafel, <ref target="n99" type="note">99</ref> Nordenskjöld’s motive was to do away with the distinction between rich and poor.) He was one of the members of the Swedenborgian "Exegetical and Philanthropic Society," founded in 1786, and editor of the Swedenborgian periodical <hi rend="i">Aftonbladet.</hi> In 1789 it was discovered that the governor of the palace of Drottningholm, A. F. Munck, was using the gold-making operation as a cover for counterfeiting. Nordenskjöld was not touched by this scandal, but the experiments were discontinued. <note id="n99"><hi rend="s">99</hi><hi rend="i"> Documents</hi>, I, 639-46.</note></p>
              <p>Early in 1789, Nordenskjöld went to England again. With Carl Bernhard Wadström, he attended the General Conference of the New Jerusalem Church in April. On 24 June he and Wadström, with several others, published <hi rend="i">A plan for a free community on the West Coast of Africa.</hi> Although the authors carefully avoid any mention of Swedenborgianism in this publication—no doubt in order to gain a wider basis of support—Sundelin is probably right in describing their aim as "to prepare, beneath the old forms of social oppression, a new form of social organization, united under the best laws . . . to create the New Jerusalem in Africa."<ref target="n100" type="note">100</ref> A little book which Nordenskjöld published in Copenhagen in 1790, <hi rend="i">Församlings Formen uti det Nya Jerusalem</hi>, evidently was intended as the constitution for this new society (see above, pp. 71). Although dedicated to Gustav III, with an introductory epistle to the king pleading for freedom of expression for Swedenborgians, <hi rend="i">Församlings Formen</hi> was banned in Sweden. <note id="n100"><hi rend="s">100</hi><hi rend="i"> Swedenborgianismens Historia i Sverige</hi>, p. 261.</note></p>
              <p>Nordenskjöld was expelled from the New Jerusalem Church as a result of the concubinage dispute, and he subsequently went to Paris in the summer of 1790 and took part in the Revolutionary festivals, to the point of dancing on the ruins of the Bastille. Hearing of this, Gustav III ordered him home to Sweden, but in 1791 Nordenskjöld was permitted to go back to England in order to take part in the founding of the Sierra Leone colony, where blacks and whites alike were to enjoy the benefits of freedom. He embarked for Africa on 10 January 1792. According to Wadström, Nordenskjöld was seriously ill at this time, but was determined to make the voyage. At Sierra Leone he was again taken ill, but Wadström says, in what is evidently a reference to Swedenborg’s idea of Africans in the interior who maintained a direct intuition of God, "He signified an ardent desire to penetrate immediately into the country, where he always hoped to find an innocent, hospitable people, among whom he could pursue his researches."<ref target="n101" type="note">101</ref> But his goods were stolen, and Nordenskjöld became too ill to continue further. Africans conveyed him by canoe from Port Logo about eighty miles to Freetown, where he died on 10 December 1792. <note id="n101"><hi rend="s">101</hi><hi rend="i"> An Essay on Colonization</hi>, II, 236.</note></p>

              <p>Carl Bernard Wadström was born in Stockholm in 1746. After completing his studies at Falun in 1770, he was employed in the College of Mines, where Emanuel Swedenborg had once held the post of Assessor. During the next few years, Wadström distinguished himself in the successful completion of a number of technical projects, and he was himself promoted to Assessor. He spent the years 1776-78 traveling in England, France, and Germany; one of the projects he undertook upon returning home was the establishment of a spinning and carding factory. By 1779 he had become a convert to Swedenborg’s doctrines, and in that year he and Augustus Nordenskjöld formed a Swedenborgian anti-slavery group in Norrköping. The idea of a colony in Africa which would have as its purpose the abolition of slavery—or at least of providing a free alternative to it—germinated in the Norrköping group. They adopted a plan for such a colony, and Gustav III granted a charter permitting forty families to emigrate. However, the war between England and France made it impossible to pursue
<pb id="p13-85" n="85"/>
the plan further at that time. In the meantime, Wadström advanced further in government service and continued his Swedenborgian activities, being one of the founders of the Exegetical and Philanthropic Society in 1786.</p>
              <p>In 1787 it became possible for Wadström to see Africa for himself. Subsidized by Gustav III, he journeyed to Guinea in a French ship, accompanied by the scientists Arrhenius and Sparrman. In a letter, Augustus Nordenskjöld urged Wadström to press on into the interior, presumably in order to discover the remnant of the Ancient Church, but Wadström only got as far as Senegal. He returned to Paris in March 1788 and went from there to London for the purpose of gaining support for the projected colony. He met the Abolitionist Thomas Clarkson, and he and Sparrman testified before the Privy Council and before Parliament on the slave trade. On a short trip to Sweden, he obtained possession of some of Swedenborg’s manuscripts, which he wanted to have published in England. These he deposited in London with Benedict Chastanier; they later became objects of much contention, and were eventually re-deposited in the Library of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Stockholm.</p>
              <p>In 1788 Wadström was baptized into the New Church along with his protegé Peter Panah, the son of an African king, who had been sold into slavery in Sierra Leone and then bought into freedom in England by Wadström. The two were the subject of a Swedenborgian portrait by Carl Frederick Breda:<ref target="n102" type="note">102</ref> in front of a palm tree, Wadström and Panah are reading Swedenborg’s <hi rend="i">Divine Providence.</hi> The painting is in the Nordiska Museet, Stockholm, but must have been painted while Breda was in London, as Panah, who died in 1790, never went to Sweden.<ref target="n103" type="note">103</ref><note id="n102"><hi rend="s">102</hi> Breda resided in London from 1787 to 1796 and was a pupil of Sir Joshua Reynolds.

Pyott after Breda’s painting was published in 1792 under the title <hi rend="i">The Benevolent Effects of Abolishing Slavery, or the Planter instructing his Negro.</hi></note></p>
              <p>In 1789 Wadström published <hi rend="i">Observations on the Slave Trade and a Description of Some Parts of Guinea</hi> and (with Nordenskjöld and others) <hi rend="i">A Plan for a Free Community on the West Coast of Africa.</hi> Although neither publication mentions Swedenborg, one can often see Swedenborgian origins of Wadström’s analysis of slavery, as when he writes: "This detestable abuse may be considered as proceeding from a degenerate love of <hi rend="i">dominion</hi>, and <hi rend="i">of possessing</hi> the property of others; which, instead of diffusing the genial influence of benevolence and liberty, produces, in their state of inversion, all the horrors of tyranny and slavery."<ref target="n104" type="note">104</ref><hi rend="i">Observations</hi> in particular deserves an honorable place in the history of anti-slavery literature; it is a factual and humanitarian account of what Wadström had himself observed of the brutality of the slave trade. A painting based on this account, <hi rend="i">The kidnapping of the Negroes as described by Mr. Wadström</hi>, was exhibited by Elias Martin at the Royal Academy in 1790. <note id="n104"><hi rend="s">104</hi><hi rend="i"> Observations</hi>, p. v.</note></p>
              <p>Wadström was also the author of <hi rend="i">An Essay on Colonization</hi>, published in two parts in 1794 and 1795. These are sumptuous volumes, with foldout maps and other elegantly engraved (but mysteriously unsigned) plates. One is an unforgettably graphic plan of how the Africans were packed into the various parts of the slave ships; an unsuccessful slave uprising on shipboard is depicted (this alone is signed "J. S. Aqua Fortis"); and there are maps and plans of Freetown, its environs, and Bulama. The original drawings of Sierra Leone by J. Becket are advertized as on display at the establishment of J. Edwards, Pall Mall, and hand colored copies of the seven engraved plates are offered for sale. Among the subscribers listed are John Adams, Alderman Boydell, Henry Hoare (who took one hundred copies), Elias Martin, Mungo Park, Joseph Priestley, Thomas Roscoe, Earl Stanhope, John Augustus Tulk, and William Wilberforce. As previously, Wadström avoids any direct reference to Swedenborg; but once more, his conceptions are colored by Swedenborgianism, as is his account of African religion:
<q>
They believe simply that there exists one God, the Creator and Preserver of all things; and, in order to fix their ideas, they think on God, in some form or other; for, to believe in any thing without form, they seem to think, is to believe in nothing. Yet, although some of them appear to consider the sun as the emblem of God, for they turn their faces towards it when praying, they seem all to believe, that God must be a man, or in human form; as they cannot think of any more perfect or respectable form to compare him with.<ref target="n105" type="note">105</ref><note id="n105"><hi rend="s">105</hi> I, 95, #149.</note></q>
One has only to compare Swedenborg’s remarks on the religion of the Africans (such as "The Africans . . . worship the Lord under a human form"; see above, fn. 20) to see that Wadström looked at the subject through Swedenborgian eyes, just as Blake did in "The Little Black Boy." It is scarcely possible that Blake, who engraved such powerful illustrations of the mistreatment of slaves for John Gabriel Stedman’s <hi rend="i">Narrative of a Five Years’ Expedition Against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</hi> (1796), was unacquainted with Wadström’s important and widely circulated books.</p>
              <p>By the time the Sierra Leone colonists were able to leave for Africa, Wadström had married and settled in Manchester, where he had become a cotton manufacturer. Presumably economic considerations kept him in England, and thus he was not present at the destruction of Freetown by French privateers in 1794. He continued his vigorous anti-slavery activity in England until 1795, publishing, in addition to his writings, thousands of impressions of engravings after his own drawings<ref target="n106" type="note">106</ref> of the atrocities of slavery. However, he failed in business in Manchester, and he left England for France in 1795. His choice of France was evidently politically motivated as well: he received the kiss of fraternity and equality before the Directory, took French citizenship, and published an <hi rend="i">Adresse au Corps Législatif et au Directoire Executif de la République Francaise</hi> (a plea for Britain and France to join in abolishing the slave trade). He founded the Réunion des Amis des Noirs et des Colons in 1797, and in 1799 he called the world’s first conference on colonial questions. He died in Paris that same year of an asthmatic complaint and was given a state funeral with ceremonial honors. <note id="n106"><hi rend="s">106</hi> Some of Wadström’s extraordinary drawings are reproduced by Hagen in <hi rend="i">En frihetstidens son.</hi></note></p>

              <p>Benedict Chastanier was a French surgeon educated at the College of St. Barbe, Paris. He emigrated to England in 1763 at the age of twenty-three. He was active in the Duché circle, where he met Count Grabianka, emissary of the Prophets of Avignon, in 1785. When Wadström brought some of Swedenborg’s manuscripts to London in 1788, he deposited them with Chastanier, who had previously translated some of Swedenborg’s writings into French.<ref target="n108" type="note">108</ref> Some of Chastanier’s writings present interesting parallels with Blake’s. <note id="n108"><hi rend="s">108</hi> Including <hi rend="i">The Heavenly Doctrine of the New Jerusalem</hi> (1782) and <hi rend="i">Influx</hi> (1785). Chastanier also contributed to the <hi rend="i">New Jerusalem Magazine</hi>, and parts of his translation into English of Swedenborg’s <hi rend="i">Spiritual Diary</hi> appeared in this and other periodicals.</note></p>
              <p><hi rend="i">Emanuel Swedenborg’s New-Year’s Gift to His Readers for MDCXCI</hi> is written as if by Swedenborg and addressed to "<hi rend="i">Sons of Liberty, Children of the Free-born Woman</hi>!" In this pamphlet "Swedenborg" denies that he "asserted the eternity of Hell’s punishments," and denies predestination as well, asserting "Essential Love’s unbounded power to rescue even from the deepest hell . . . " (p. 14). On developments in France, he writes: "kind Providence has left a door wide open for the TRUTH OF THE KINGDOM to enter in and to establish itself with all possible, or even desirable liberty, in spiritual matters" (p. 37). Chastanier also translates some extracts from what he calls Swedenborg’s "Diary of Memorable Relations," a manuscript then in Chastanier’s possession. One of these passages, in which Swedenborg describes the fall of an angel, has a striking resemblance to Blake’s later account of passing through a Vortex in <hi rend="i">Milton.</hi> In Chastanier’s rendition, Swedenborg says:
<q>
There first appears a folding-up, as it were, of a veil round the head, at a certain distance: by the Angel’s whirling about, the veil is flying up, even as I have seen it somewhere represented in some picture. Presently the folding-up becomes swifter and swifter, until the whole veil appears upwards; but by his swift whirling about there appeared as a sphere of an horizontal winding, such as is the sphere of the circulating atmosphere, and that went from right to left. . . .<lb/>
The veil thus formed into such a sphere, another that stood close by him, took hold of it, as it were; then the sphere of the veil unfolded itself in a contrary direction, so that it was unfolded from that veil, and was lessened: yet it lasted pretty long from the peripheries to the central place where he stood; and while it came close by him, he fell backwards into a black pool, very filthy, until the Lord delivered him from thence. (p. 18)
</q>
In <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> the significance attached to the motion is entirely different, but the motion itself is essentially similar.
<q>
The nature of infinity is this: That every thing has its<lb/>
Own Vortex; and when once a traveller thro’ Eternity<lb/>
Has passd that Vortex, he percieves it roll backward behind<lb/>
His path, into a globe itself infolding; like a sun:<lb/>
Or like a moon, or like a universe of starry majesty,<lb/>
While he keeps onwards in his wondrous journey on the earth<lb/>
Or like a human form, a friend with whom he livd benevolent. (15:21-27, E 108)
</q>
In each account of a change of state takes place as the subject passes from "whirling about" or "Vortex" to see it become a "sphere" or "globe"; and Swedenborg’s description implies, as Blake’s, that the whole process winds itself up again in order to be repeated.</p>
              <p>In 1795, Chastanier published <hi rend="i">A Word of Advice to a Benighted World</hi>, in which the prophet Richard Brothers is rejected and the Avignon Society (or Prophets of Avignon) denounced as "the Synagogue of Satan." Blake also uses this term in late parts of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> and in <hi rend="i">Milton.</hi> The common source is Revelation ii.9 and iii.9, and as Damon says the basic meaning is "the worldly church."<ref target="n109" type="note">109</ref> In their appropriation of a typological symbol from Revelation, both Blake and Chastanier (and Chastanier’s sources, identified as H. Jones and Sarah Flaxmer) exhibit the millenarian tendency to interpret contemporary history in apocalyptic terms. <note id="n109"><hi rend="s">109</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Dictionary</hi>, p. 394.</note></p>

              <p>Some matters concerning Swedenborg’s skull<ref target="n110" type="note">110</ref> should be summarized here, as Blake could have seen what was then supposed to be the real skull some time between 1819 and 1823. <note id="n110"><hi rend="s">110</hi> See J. Vilk. Hultkrantz, "The Mortal Remains of Emanuel Swedenborg," <hi rend="i">Nova Acta Regiae Societas Scientarum Upsaliensis</hi>, Ser. IV, Vol. II (1910), 10-15; Folke Henschen, "Emanuel Swedenborg’s Cranium: A Critical Analysis," <hi rend="i">Nova Acta Regiae Societatis Scientarium Upsaliensis</hi>, Ser. IV, Vol. XVII (1960). Where the two accounts do not agree, Henschen’s is the more accurate.</note></p>
              <p>In 1817 an impoverished Swedish merchant captain named Ludwig Granholm removed the skull from Swedenborg’s coffin in the vault of the Swedish Church in London. His motive evidently was the mistaken belief that some Swedenborgian would pay a large amount of money for the skull. Dying in 1819, Granholm confessed the theft to the pastor of the Swedish Church, J. P. Wåhlin, and restored the skull to him. Paston Wåhlin announced the recovery of the skull to his Church Council on 4 July 1819. However, probably for reasons of security, the pastor did not immediately return the skull to Swedenborg’s coffin. Instead he entrusted it to a prominent Swedenborgian—Charles Augustus Tulk. Tulk showed the skull to his acquaintances on occasion, and consequently it was examined by John Flaxman. According to "testimony" collected by J. J. Garth Wilkinson,
<q>
Flaxman examined the skull of Swedenborg at Mr. Charles A. Tulk’s in the presence of Mr. Clowes and Mr. Clover, and he said: ‘How beautiful the form—how undulating the line here; here’s no deficiency, Mr. Clowes. Smiling he said, ‘Why, I should almost take it for a female head, were it not for the peculiar character of the forehead.’<ref target="n111" type="note">111</ref><pb id="p13-87" n="87"/>
On the question of whether a cast should be taken, Mr. Flaxman observed ‘that the skull was worthy of it for its mere beauty.’<ref target="n112" type="note">112</ref><note id="n111"><hi rend="s">111</hi> Evidently Flaxman refers to the condition known as scaphocephaly, defined by Hultkrantz as a pathological deformity (not, however, linked with any mental disease) characterized by a ridge-like vertex and a fusion of the parietal bone, making the skull unusually long and narrow.—See "Additional Note to the Mortal Remains of Emanuel Swedenborg," <hi rend="i">Nova Acta Regiae Societas Scientarum Upsaliensis</hi>, Ser. IV, Vol. III (1912). It is interesting that both of the skulls which have been considered to be Swedenborg’s are scaphocephalic. The condition would have been disguised by the bag wig worn by Swedenborg in his portraits.</note><note id="n112"><hi rend="s">112</hi> R. L. Tafel, <hi rend="i">Documents Concerning the Life and Character of Emanuel Swedenborg</hi> (London: Swedenborg Society, 1877), II, 555-56.</note></q>
Since Blake was also a friend of Tulk’s and was also greatly interested in phrenology at this time,<ref target="n113" type="note">113</ref> it is likely that he too took the opportunity to see the skull. It was returned to Swedenborg’s tomb on 25 March 1823. <note id="n113"><hi rend="s">113</hi> See Anne K. Mellor, "Physiognomy, Phrenology, and Blake’s Visionary Heads," <hi rend="i">Blake in His Time</hi>, ed. Robert N. Essick and Donald Pearce (Bloomington and London: Indiana University Press, 1978), pp. 53-74.</note></p>
              <p>In 1908, Swedenborg’s remains were transported from England to Sweden for entombment in the cathedral at Uppsala. This provided an opportunity for the examination of the skeleton by Dr. J. V. Hultkrantz, Professor of Anatomy at the University of Uppsala, and two associates. Despite rumors which had persisted throughout the nineteenth century as to the existence of another, authentic Swedenborg skull, Dr. Hultkrantz saw no reason to doubt the authenticity of the "Granholm skull." At about this time, letters were received from a "Mr. R." in London, asserting that the true Swedenborg skull had been in the possession of an antiquary in the East End of London during the 1870s. However, Mr. R. was confined in an insane asylum and therefore could not pursue the matter further. After his release, Mr. R.—whose name was W. Rutherford—reported that he had found the true skull. He furnished Dr. Hultkrantz with tracings, photos, and a plaster cast; and he published letters on the subject in the <hi rend="i">East London Observer</hi> for 16 March and 23 March 1912. In an article later published in the <hi rend="i">Journal of Anatomy and Physiology</hi>, Rutherford maintained that "Half a century ago a collector of curios in Wellclose Square, close to the old Swedish church, exhibited a skull which he claimed to be that of Emanuel Swedenborg."<ref target="n114" type="note">114</ref> Before he died, the antiquary gave his collection to a friend, but the friend was unaware that one of the skulls was Swedenborg’s. It was that skull, which had the letters "E. S’borg" scratched onto it, which Rutherford now claimed to have recovered. Hultkrantz, however, remained unconvinced, dismissed Rutherford’s view, and reaffirmed the authenticity of the Granholm skull. There the matter rested for another 35 years. <note id="n114"><hi rend="s">114</hi> W. Rutherford, "A Swedenborg Mystery: the Rival Skulls," <hi rend="i">Journal of Anatomy and Physiology</hi>, XLVII, 3rd Ser., vol. IX (1914), 86-88.</note></p>
              <p>In 1958, Swedenborg’s remains were re-examined at Uppsala by Dr. Folke Henschen, who also had the English skull tested by a number of specialists. As a result of these scientific tests, it was established that the Granholm skull did not belong to Swedenborg’s skeleton. In a brilliant feat of detective work, Henschen formulated an hypothesis as to what had happened. Granholm had indeed taken a skull from Swedenborg’s coffin and had later restored it—but previous to Granholm’s theft the real skull had been removed! The successful thief was John Didrik Holm, whom Henschen characterizes as "a wealthy Swedish captain and a fanatical phrenologist and owner of a large phrenological museum in London."<ref target="n115" type="note">115</ref> Among other skulls, Holm reportedly owned that of Alexander Pope; he later acquired the collections of Gall and of Spurzheim. It was, then, the "Holm skull" which Rutherford saw in the 1870s, which he found again in 1908, and which was sold at Sotheby’s in 1978 to be re-united with the rest of Swedenborg’s remains in Uppsala. <note id="n115"><hi rend="s">115</hi> "Emanuel Swedenborg’s Cranium," p. 9. It is worth noting that all four reports published by <hi rend="i">The Times</hi> on this subject in 1823 were wrong. The original account (March 23) said that the skull was removed after the original opening of the tomb. The Swedenborgian minister S. Noble corrected this error, adding that the thief was a Swedish disciple of Gall still living in England, but Noble accepted the restored skull as genuine (March 1). J. I. Hawkins then named Granholm as the thief, saying Granholm had shown Hawkins the "Granholm skull" as the real one (April 4). Finally, J. P. Wåhlin, under the name "Tertius Interveniens" wrote to the effect that the thief was a phrenologist who died "a few years after" (April 5, and <hi rend="i">Dagsländor</hi>, 1846, pp. 223-225).</note></p>
              <p>Nevertheless, some questions remain. It seems odd that Rutherford had so little difficulty in tracing a skull which he had not seen for some thirty-five years. The tests performed under Henschen’s direction proved the Granholm skull to be inauthentic, but they did not positively prove the authenticity of the Holm skull. At present all that can be said is that the Holm skull is a likelier candidate than any other.</p>

          </title>
        </head>
        <byline><docAuthor><hi rend="b">THOMAS L.</hi><name><hi rend="b">MINNICK</hi></name></docAuthor> WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF <docAuthor><hi rend="b">DETLEF W.</hi><name><hi rend="b">DÖRRBECKER</hi></name></docAuthor> AND <docAuthor><hi rend="b">KAZUMITSU</hi><name><hi rend="b">WATARAI</hi></name></docAuthor></byline>
        <p>Readers may notice several changes in this year’s checklist, beginning with the title. "A Checklist of Recent Blake Scholarship," our title for the last several years, has been enlarged to include Blake’s "circle," a term we interpret very broadly. In fact, this has been, in intention and in practice, the range of the checklist since its beginning, and our change merely acknowledges a continuing policy. Thus, items on Fuseli, Flaxman, Runge, the Pre-Raphaelites, and Maurice Sendak in his Blakean moments (as one critic judges them) are included—even a biography of John Middleton Murry and <hi rend="i">his</hi> circle, because of Murry’s early work on Blake. Casting so wide a net we cannot hope to be exhaustive; but we try.</p>
        <p>In a second major change, we welcome Kazumitsu Watarai, Head Librarian of Japan’s Reitaku University Library, to our annual hunt. Mr. Watarai’s bibliography of Blake scholarship in Japan from 1969 to 1977 was published too late for inclusion in this year’s checklist (wait till next year, or see the Winter 1978-79 issue of <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi>). He will be helping us keep up to date on Japanese writing on Blake—a long neglected group of works.</p>
        <p>Finally, we have made several changes in the format of the checklist, including somewhat greater annotation. Readers may expect to see additional changes (and are encouraged to send suggestions) as we work toward the most usable organization and format. As has become our common practice, an asterisk designates items published more than five years ago that have not been noted in other standard sources.</p>
        <p>As always, we thank contributors for sending along notice of their own publications. My personal thanks to Professor G. E. Bentley, Jr., for his helpful correspondence concerning previous checklists.</p>

        <p>Although her reputation is somewhat diminished now, Charlotte Smith was the most celebrated novelist in England in the early 1790s. Like George Romney, John Flaxman, William Cowper, and William Blake, Mrs. Smith was one of a number of writers and painters assisted by William Hayley in various ways. Mrs. Smith met Cowper at Eartham in 1792, and the events of that friendship have been chronicled.<ref target="n116" type="note">1</ref> Mrs. Smith never met William Blake, and only one excerpt from a letter linking them has previously been published. In this note, I should like to provide some additional information on Mrs. Smith and Cowper, but I shall as well cite three unpublished excerpts from her correspondence in which she comments on Blake. <note id="n116"><hi rend="s">1</hi> See Morchard Bishop, <hi rend="i">Blake’s Hayley</hi> (London, 1951), pp. 161-66.</note></p>
        <p>In an article of 1952, Alan Dugald McKillop provided an excellent account of Charlotte Smith’s letters.<ref target="n117" type="note">2</ref> In the course of that essay, McKillop notes a facetious and denigrating remark of 20 March 1806 (Huntington) about Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads</hi> (1802) and <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (1805) which includes a comment on William Blake: " . . . &amp; at his [Hayley’s] strange tho benevolent fancy of writing such very sad doggrell, for the purpose of serving a Man, who might be any thing than an engraver . . . "<ref target="n118" type="note">3</ref><note id="n117"><hi rend="s">2</hi> "Charlotte Smith’s Letters," <hi rend="i">Huntington Library Quarterly</hi>, 45 (1952), 237-55. McKillop confines himself to a description of the forty-five letters in the Huntington collection. The letters contain details on Mrs. Smith’s harrowing domestic conflicts, the arduous life of a professional writer in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and details of her quarrels with Lord Egremont and William Hayley. Neither Bishop nor Florence Hilbish, <hi rend="i">Charlotte Smith</hi> (Philadelphia, 1941), still the standard work on its subject, provides any evidence of the hostility Charlotte Smith felt towards Hayley from c. 1800 until her death in 1806.</note><note id="n118"><hi rend="s">3</hi> HM 10843.</note></p>
        <p>There is a more substantial reference to Blake in a letter to the same correspondent, Sarah Farr Rose, of 25 April 1806 (Huntington).<ref target="n119" type="note">4</ref> As before, Mrs. Smith is complaining about Hayley’s neglect of her.
<q>
I lose a great part of the regret I might otherwise feel in recollecting, that a mind so indiscriminating, who is now seized with a rage for a crooked figure=maker &amp; now for an engraver of Ballad pictures (the young Mans tragedy; &amp; the jolly Sailers Farewell to his true love Sally)—I dont mean the Hayleyan collection of pretty ballads)<ref target="n120" type="note">5</ref>—Such a mind, can never be really attached; or is the attachment it can feel worth having— 
                    </q>
The "crooked figure=maker" is probably a reference to Flaxman and his hunch-back; despite the disclaimer, the engraver is more than likely to be Blake. 
                    <note id="n119"><hi rend="s">4</hi> HM 10844. I am grateful to Professor G. E. Bentley, Jr. for his kindness in providing me with this citation.</note><note id="n120"><hi rend="s">5</hi> Mrs. Smith is again referring to <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads</hi> and <hi rend="i">Ballads.</hi> See G. E. Bentley, Jr., "William Blake as a Private Publisher," <hi rend="i">Bulletin of the New York Public Library</hi>, 61 (1957), 539-60.</note></p>
        <p>Recently, three previously unkown Charlotte Smith letters were discovered in Brantford, Ontario, and these letters, acquired by the Research Collections division of Mills Memorial Library, McMaster University, supplement the references to Blake in the Huntington collection and contain as well a significant reference to Cowper.</p>
        <pb id="p13-101" n="101"/>
        <p>The McMaster letters are of 9 September 1802, 9 February 1803, and 19 February 1803; all three signed autograph letters are addressed to Samuel Rose (1767-1804), Cowper’s friend and correspondent, and the lawyer who defended Blake against the charge of sedition at Chichester in 1804. Rose apparently acted as Lord Egremont’s London agent in handling Mrs. Smith’s affairs. Although the Huntington owns a dozen letters to his wife, Sarah, from Mrs. Smith,<ref target="n121" type="note">6</ref> they have only a single letter to Rose himself of 11 September 1803, and there do not seem to be letters to Rose in any other collection. <note id="n121"><hi rend="s">6</hi> There are Charlotte Smith letters to Mrs. Rose in the Berg Collection, New York Public Library (2), the Houghton Library, Harvard University (2), and the Charles Roberts Autograph Collection, Haverford College (1). In her letter to Mrs. Rose of 10 September 1804 (Harvard), she makes her only comment on Blake by name; she is deliberating whether to send Hayley a copy of <hi rend="i">Conversations Introducing Poetry.</hi> "Before I venture to send him my little book, I [want] to know if it would be acceptable for notwithstanding he has begun a Poetical Buffon [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] himself, to assist his worldly friend Mr Blake, I was afraid mine, would be deem’d too juvenile."</note></p>
        <p>Despite what might be termed worldly success, Mrs. Smith’s financial and family difficulties made her of a melancholy cast, and she and Cowper recognized in each other in 1792 a shared response to the vanity of human wishes. Mrs. Smith’s dedication of her poem, <hi rend="i">The Emigrants</hi> (1793), to Cowper is beautifully expressed and touching, and she notes the "force, clearness, and sublimity" which allows Cowper to give "dignity and effect" to "the most familiar objects."<ref target="n122" type="note">7</ref> in her letter of 9 September 1802, she refers to the "two Letters of Mr Cowpers which he honord me with some years since —".<ref target="n123" type="note">8</ref> It is her letter of 9 February 1803, in which she movingly reflects on Cowper’s death, which has the most significant material; she has just received the first two volumes of Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Life of Cowper</hi> (1803). <note id="n122"><hi rend="s">7</hi> P. v.</note><note id="n123"><hi rend="s">8</hi> Cowper’s letter to Mrs. Smith of 25 July 1793 is known only from its printing in Havley’s <hi rend="i">Life of Cowper</hi> (Chichester and London, 1803), II, 234; the holograph of his letter of 26 October 1793 is at Princeton.</note></p>
        <q>
Allow me also to beg (for the same reason) that you will make known to Mr Hayley my gratitude for the Work I so earnestly wish’d to see, and which arrived here on Tuesday—I have only had time to read the dedication &amp; some pages of the first volume—My spirits I hope will serve me to go thro it in the course of the next three or four days—Yet it is not a book (relating as it does to such a person)—which can be read, at least I cannot read it, without a variety of sensations that, no other book in the World can excite—<lb/>
Alas! for the friends I have lost—for the days that are gone!
</q>
        <p>Earlier, in the same letter, Mrs. Smith refers to a possible commission for Flaxman and goes on to make inquiries for an engraver for the plates she intended for <hi rend="i">Conversations Introducing Poetry</hi> (1804).<ref target="n124" type="note">9</ref><q>
I am afraid of addressing myself to Mr Hayley now on any subject whatever—I have not been favord with any answer to the Letters I took the liberty to address to him under cover to you—which related to information my daughter<ref target="n125" type="note">10</ref> desird me to obtain of Mr Flaxman, relative to the means of sending over a small Marble tablet or urn to Barbados inscribed to the Memory of my unfortunate Charles<ref target="n126" type="note">11</ref> — Perhaps however he has been so good as to send an answer to Miss Smith—My present purpose, is, to enquire, whether there is not an ingenious Engraver who executed certain plates for a small work of Mr Hayley’s relating to Animals.<ref target="n127" type="note">12</ref> I know not what it is as I have never seen it. 
                        <note id="n124"><hi rend="s">9</hi> There is no evidence that Flaxman ever became involved in such a project, and <hi rend="i">Conversations</hi> does not contain any plates.</note><note id="n125"><hi rend="s">10</hi> Probably Charlotte Mary (<hi rend="i">pre</hi> 1774-<hi rend="i">post</hi> 1807).</note><note id="n126"><hi rend="s">11</hi> In 1800 Charles Dyer Smith (1773-1801) had been appointed paymaster of the 47th Regiment at Bermuda. He contracted yellow fever in Barbados en route to his new post and died there.</note><note id="n127"><hi rend="s">12</hi><hi rend="i"> Designs to a Series of Ballads.</hi></note></q>
In the McMaster letter of 1803, Mrs. Smith simply inquires about an "ingenious Engraver" whereas in the later Harvard and Huntington letters of 1804 and 1806, the references to Blake are clearly hostile. This change is probably due in large part to the fact that by 1804 Mrs. Smith was fully aware of the extent of Hayley’s patronage of Blake at Felpham from 1800-1803, and she had obviously heard of Blake’s trial at Chichester. 
                </p>
        <p>The McMaster letters demonstrate further the omnipresent patronage and involvement of William Hayley in the careers of some of the most gifted writers and artists of his age. They help reveal as well Charlotte Smith’s dissatisfaction with Hayley. Finally, although the letters at McMaster contain only passing references by Mrs. Smith on William Cowper and William Blake, they are of interest in showing how one of the most widely-known and published authors of the time reacted to the celebrated recluse at Weston Underwood and to the relatively obscure "ingenious" engraver-poet.</p>

        <p>The consensus among Blake scholars seems to be that Blake’s "Mad Song" depicts the condition of insanity. A handful of critics will occasionally concede that the speaker may be a poet who has lost his sanity because of his poetry, but they invariably offer "inability to create" as the specific cause of his dementia. The evidence suggests, however, that the speaker’s "affliction" is not impotence but omnipotence.</p>
        <p>"The most interesting influence of the <hi rend="i">Reliques</hi>," says Margaret Ruth Lowery in <hi rend="i">Windows of the Morning</hi>, "is found in Blake’s ‘Mad Song,’" which, she contends, "shows the influence of no one single poem, but is a compound of many." Like all the mad songs collected in Percy’s <hi rend="i">Religues of Ancient English Poetry</hi>, a book owned and annotated by Blake, "Mad Song" is written in the first person and shares the same general theme. "All emphasize the frantic, tortuous nature of madness; all seek pity for their woe. . . . In ideas, in imagery, in phrasing, in rhythm," Lowery concludes, "Blake’s debt to no one was more direct than of his ‘Mad Song’ to Percy’s <hi rend="i">Reliques.</hi>"<ref target="n128" type="note">1</ref><note id="n128"><hi rend="s">1</hi> (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1940), pp. 161,165.</note></p>
        <p>In his <hi rend="i">Fearful Symmetry</hi>, Northrop Frye discusses the correspondence between the mental condition of the "Mad Song" speaker and the state of his physical surroundings, a correspondence common in Romantic poetry. Frye observes further a desire on the part of the speaker to perpetuate this correspondence and considers him a prisoner of space and time,<ref target="n129" type="note">2</ref> an idea echoed and expanded by Harold Bloom. <note id="n129"><hi rend="s">2</hi> 2nd ed. (1947; rpt. Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1949), p. 179.</note></p>
        <p>In his commentary in David Erdman’s edition of <hi rend="i">The Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>, Bloom argues that Blake’s "radical innovation on the Elizabethan ‘mad song’ and its imitations [was] to make the song a satire upon both its willfully deranged singer and the mental world that singer seeks to escape."<ref target="n130" type="note">3</ref> Bloom also suggests that Blake’s poem may be an ironic commentary on the escape of the poets of the Age of Sensibility—Smart, Cowper, Chatterton, Macpherson, and Collins—into melancholia and despair. Says Bloom in <hi rend="i">Blake’s Apocalypse</hi>: "The grimness of Blake’s irony is probably due to the little poem’s satiric function as the young poet’s warning to himself."<ref target="n131" type="note">4</ref><note id="n130"><hi rend="s">3</hi> (Garden City: Doubleday, 1965), p. 887.</note><note id="n131"><hi rend="s">4</hi> (Garden City: Doubleday, 1963), pp. 19-20.</note></p>
        <p>In discussing the influence of the <hi rend="i">Reliques</hi> on Blake’s "Mad Song," Lowery notes that four of the six poems selected by Percy "attribute madness to love, or being in love. There is nothing in Blake’s poem that speaks of love; rather there is a suggestion that the madness is over his poetry."<ref target="n132" type="note">5</ref> For John Ehrstine as well, the speaker is "apparently a poet [who] cannot use his imagination."<ref target="n133" type="note">6</ref><note id="n132"><hi rend="s">5</hi><hi rend="i"> Windows</hi>, p. 161.</note><note id="n133"><hi rend="s">6</hi><hi rend="i"> William Blake’s Poetical Sketches</hi> (Pullman: Washington State Univ.

        <p>In his captivating <hi rend="i">Curiosities of Literature</hi>, Izaac Disraeli traces the origin of the "Tom o’ Bedlam" character—the traditional hero of the mad song. The overcrowding at Bethlehem Hospital forced its governors to release prematurely inmates who then "wandered about the country, chanting wild ditties, and wearing a fantastical dress to attract the notice of the charitable, on whose alms they lived." As with any successful money-making gimmick, imposters called "Abram men" soon joined the ranks of the "legitimate." Disraeli cites Edgar in Shakespeare’s <hi rend="i">King Lear</hi> as the most likely original dramatic representation of a Bedlamite character.<ref target="n134" type="note">7</ref><note id="n134"><hi rend="s">7</hi> (New York: World Publ. House, 1876), pp. 203-04.</note></p>
        <p>According to Robert Reed’s <hi rend="i">Bedlam on the Jacobean Stage</hi>, the mad characters of Elizabethan playwrights were "little more than stereotyped renditions whose disordered minds were capable of imagining superhuman achievements"; "the Jacobean madman, on the other hand, was a much more objective study; he expressed the frustrations, not the potentialities of mankind." Jacobean portrayals of mad characters were quite often modeled not on the original "Tom o’ Bedlams," but on the "Abram men"
<pb id="p13-103" n="103"/>
who impersonated them: "The Jacobean malcontent was forced by the moral decadence of his environment to disguise himself as the madman or the fool." Such a character, moreover, usually served as a vehicle for satire, often uttering the most profound and enlightened statements in the play.<ref target="n135" type="note">8</ref><note id="n135"><hi rend="s">8</hi> (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1952), p. 113.</note></p>
        <p>The Tom o’ Bedlam poem which most closely follows, chronologically, the counterfeit mad songs of Edgar seems to be that reprinted by Joseph Ritson, Disraeli and Percy in their respective collections and beginning "From the hag and hungry goblin."<ref target="n136" type="note">9</ref> Jack Lindsay, whose <hi rend="i">Loving Mad Tom</hi> is the most thorough and authoritative text on the subject of mad songs, cites, as "the first printed example of a clear reaction from the poem," two stanzas from Ben Jonson’s <hi rend="i">The Masque of the Metamorphosed Gypsie</hi> which in turn inspired Herrick’s "The Night-piece to Julia."<ref target="n137" type="note">10</ref> In addition to adapting the mad song form for use as a wooing poem, Herrick used it elsewhere, as in "Upon Jane and Jone," when depicting characters who are not what they seem, who, like the counterfeit Toms., "sham Abraham." <note id="n136"><hi rend="s">9</hi> Ernest Rhys, ed., <hi rend="i">Percy’s Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</hi> (London: J.

        <p>The other mad songs contained in Percy’s <hi rend="i">Reliques</hi> include a satire on evangelists by Bishop Corbet; "I’ll sail upon the Dog-star" by D’Urfey, the most prolific of mad song writers; two by Henry Carey as erratic in form as D’Urfey’s, and likewise concerning madness induced by unrequited love; and an anonymous effort beginning "Grim king of the ghosts, make haste," presumably written around the middle of the seventeenth century.</p>
        <p>Since he titled his poem "Mad Song" and yet abandoned the traditional mad song stanza—two trimeters, two dimeters, and a final dimeter, rhyming xabba or aabbx—one suspects that Blake intended the reader to ponder this discrepancy. The use of both the mad song form itself and the mad character as vehicles for satire was well established when Blake wrote his poem.</p>
        <p>Though he rejected the traditional five-line stanza and the refrain which followed in the earliest versions, Blake did employ the double stanza common to many mad songs, combining two quatrains rather than two five-line stanzas, and he did, in his own way, alternate trimeter and dimeter lines, though using couplets and crossing his rhymes rather than embracing them. In rejecting the traditional refrain used by Bedlamites for begging, Blake indicates that the speaker of his "Mad Song" is not flaunting or simulating his "madness" for financial ends.</p>
        <p>Blake retains the traditional temporal setting of the mad song, night with dawn approaching. Like the speakers of most mad songs, his speaker displays a preference for night and a concomitant distaste for day. Blake’s speaker also imitates his mad ancestors in personifying the forces of nature. And his brain struck like theirs by intense light, he too cries to the heavens. As the Bedlamite characters of early mad songs described the bondage which they had suffered in asylums, so Blake’s speaker seems to be detailing a bondage or enslavement, but of a more abstract sort. As to the speakers of earlier mad songs, to Blake’s speaker sleep seems a means of relief.</p>
        <p>Although Blake’s "Mad Song" appears to be the first use of the form to portray the "madness" of poetic inspiration, nevertheless there are hints of this theme in the earliest mad songs, even in those of Shakespeare. In <hi rend="i">King Lear</hi> Edgar may very well be feigning a sort of poetic madness in claiming that "the foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale" (III.vi.28-29), since the nightingale commonly symbolized the poet. His reference to "the night-mare, and her nine-fold" (III.iv.115) may be a deliberately perverse or demented allusion to the goddess Memory and her nine daughters, the Muses.</p>
        <p>The mad song beginning "From the hag and hungry goblin" also contains suggestions that the madness depicted is a poetic one. The last stanza begins
<q>
With a host of furious fancies<lb/>
Whereof I am commander,<lb/>
With a burning spear,<lb/>
And a horse of the ayr. . . .
</q>
The poet is commonly depicted as one who is surrounded by "furious fancies," and the horse of the fourth line suggests Pegasus, the Greek representation of poetic inspiration. The speaker’s assertion in the sixth stanza of this poem that he knows more than Apollo may be construed as a manifestation of the poet’s vanity.</p>
        <p>In Basse’s "Forth from the dark and dismal Cell," the speaker refers not only to Apollo, but to Vulcan as well, appealing to the latter to "knock off my troublesome shackles." Here Vulcan, god of fire, appears to be a variant or dimension of the poetic deity which Apollo generally represents. He is invoked to rend what seem to be the same shackles from which Blake’s speaker desires to escape, those of time. Basse’s speaker actually encounters his oppressor, "Old Time":
<q>
When me he spies<lb/>
Away he flies,<lb/>
For Time will stay for no man;<lb/>
In vain with cryes,<lb/>
I rend the skies,<lb/>
For Pity is not common.
</q></p>
        <p>Both Shakespeare and Herrick used the mad song form when presenting characters whose external appearance belied their true dispositions, Shakespeare with Edgar who feigned madness, Herrick with Jone the seemingly virtuous whore. Blake’s poem, too, is a portrait of someone who seems to society something other than what he is. Because of the nature of the poetic process and because of the prejudices of society, the inspired poet is deemed mad.</p>
        <pb id="p13-104" n="104"/>
        <p>Blake begins "Mad Song" with a brief description of the speaker’s environment—a cold, windy night—immediately thereafter invoking Sleep in a way reminiscent of Sidney and Daniel, each of whom begins one of his sonnets in a similar fashion. The "morning" in the middle of the first stanza unites the contrary states of day and night—symbolically reason and energy perhaps—and, of course, "Without Contraries is no progression."<ref target="n140" type="note">13</ref> The birds—of dawn, not day—also represent unions of contraries, of earth and air, or body and spirit. The first stanza ends with the scorn of the birds of dawn, which parallels the scorn of the speaker and the scorn which Blake himself felt toward those who mocked inspiration and labeled him a madman. Moreover, the bird imagery calls to mind the traditional symbolic association of the bird with the poet and with the holy spirit, most specifically in the forms of the nightingale and the dove. By crowding after night, Blake’s speaker makes clear that he shares the birds’ scorn for the earth, that he identifies with them, that—figuratively speaking—he wants to fly. <note id="n140"><hi rend="s">13</hi><hi rend="i"> The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, The Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>, p. 34.</note></p>
        <p>In the second stanza, the speaker directs his cries to heaven, presumably the habitation of the Muse-like Sleep. The words "vault" and "paved," used to describe heaven, suggest not only riches but also the possibility of travel or transmigration across a celestial pathway. The word "notes" reiterates the identification of the speaker as a poet. Here the interpretations of Lowery and Ehrstine collapse: if the poem is intended to depict a poet unable to use his imagination, how is it that the speaker manages to compose and sing "notes"? The last two lines confirm the identification by demonstrating the ability of the speaker’s music to confront, control and incorporate the forces of nature. In these lines Blake alludes to Shakespeare’s Prospero, who also could "make mad the roaring winds, / And with tempests play." Since Prospero is the main character in <hi rend="i">The Tempest</hi>, the juxtaposition of the words "tempests" and "play" is not likely accidental. Blake is drawing a parallel between the speaker of his poem and the magician Prospero, who typifies the poet scorned by and scorning his native society.</p>
        <p>Blake’s speaker begins the third stanza by comparing himself to "a fiend in a cloud." In addition to representing the body—the fiend corresponding to the spirit enclosed or, as in Platonic theory, imprisoned in the body—the cloud may also symbolize the limitations of reason, which restrict and confine the energy represented by the fiend. As death frees the soul from the body, so night presumably frees the fiend from his cloud. In turning his "back to the east, / From whence comforts have increas’d"—suggesting both the comforts of day and the luxuries traditionally associated with the orient—the speaker rejects what Blake, in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, called the "strong delusive light of Time &amp; Space."<ref target="n141" type="note">14</ref> Like the speaker of Carey’s second mad song, Blake’s speaker elects to "leave this false, imaginary light, / And seek the dismal shades of night." And like the speaker in Daniel’s "Care-charmer Sleep," he invokes Sleep to "restore the light." <note id="n141"><hi rend="s">14</hi> Erdman, <hi rend="i">Poetry and Prose</hi>, p. 228.</note></p>
        <p>Blake’s speaker thus remains faithful to his genius. In turning his back to the east, to the light of day, he turns to a different light, a light which is painful rather than comforting, one which seizes his brain rather than his eyes. (Does not the word "seize" in the second-to-last line suggest the ages-old interpretation of seizures as manifestations of divine inspiration or genius?) In turning his back to the east, the speaker symbolically annihilates the world of reason—the world of the critic who thinks him mad—and seeks refuge in the tempestuous nightly world of energy.</p>
        <p>The speaker of Blake’s "Mad Song" is not mad, but inspired. Blake’s "radical innovation on the Elizabethan ‘mad song’ and its imitations" is not, as Bloom attests, making the song a "satire upon both its willfully deranged singer"—the traditional satiric use—"and the mental world that singer seeks to escape," but rather making it a satire on the self-imposed judges of artistic propriety. The irony of the title is that the term "mad" is their description, not Blake’s. Sure enough, the critics have interpreted the song much as the Jacobean mad character’s fellow actors interpreted his comments—"as the blunt railleries of a demented mind." Perhaps the poem is, as Bloom contends, "the young poet’s warning to himself," but if so, Blake was admonishing himself not to avoid madness but to be prepared to have that label attached to products of his imagination. Blake knew that "Mad Song" would be misinterpreted. And so it has been.</p>

Blake’s Thornton Marginalia
</q>
          <p>The double meaning in Blake’s wirey bounding line is perhaps present in all of his uses of the word "bounding"—or at least of the terms "bounding line" and "outline." Blake’s line of beauty/energy, "the bounding line and its infinite inflexions and movements" (<hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> 15), is conceived of as doing two things: (1) delineating—"the falling Mind labour’d / Organizing itself" (<hi rend="i">B Los</hi> 4:49-50), "And Orc began to Organize a Serpent body" (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 7:80:44), "embodied and organized in solid marble" (<hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> 4), "Branchy forms: organizing the Human" (<hi rend="i">B Los</hi> 4:44)—(2) leaping—as when Tharmas, boundary god, travels by "high bounding over hills &amp; desarts floods &amp; horrible chasms" (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 6:69:24). In short, delineating through movement.</p>
          <p>Less noticed, or noticed but seldom recalled, is Blake’s expression of the delight he and Catherine felt in their Felpham cottage as the first winter set in:
<q>
Our cottage is surrounded by the same guardians you left with us; they keep off every wind. We hear the west howl at a distance, the south bounds on high over our thatch, and smiling on our cottage says: "You lay too low for my anger to injure." As to the east and north, I believe they cannot get past the Turret. (To Hayley 26 November 1800)
</q><figure><head><hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 32(36).</head><figDesc>Copy D, Harvard College Library.</figDesc></figure>
Is it only the south <hi rend="i">wind</hi> that bounds (a sufficient meaning for Hayley) or is it not the South itself? Los’s furnaces are in the south now and cathedron’s looms (<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 59:23); in the south remains a burning fire (18), a furnace of dire flames from Orc’s cave (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 6:74:14). The south is where the golden bow lies, to be seized (<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 97); it is where the golden fire burns when the day begins, the revolution; unfallen, Urizen prince of light dwelt in the south, the "bright South." When Luvah took charge it became the "fiery south." Orc the first born coiled in the South—for the serpent can coil to bind . . . or to bound up in Human form.</p>
          <p>In <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 32(36) when the poet describes the Four Zoas raging in East &amp; West &amp; North &amp; South and changing their situations, he watches Albion seeing the Elements divide. "And Urizen assumes the East, Luvah assumes the South." Blake then begins to announce the names of the Zoas "in the Vegetative Generation" (line 33)—only to scour from the copper plate and keep secret the list of their names that was to be line 34. Fifteen years ago in "The Suppressed and Altered Passages in Blake’s <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>" (<hi rend="i">Studies in Bibliography</hi> 17 [1964]:21) I managed to decipher the four compass-point names, with their actions—all but the "action" of South that must be a transforming match for the weighing and dividing of the three others:
<q>
[<hi rend="i">West Weighing East &amp; North dividing Generation South</hi> [ ]<hi rend="i">ing</hi>]
</q></p>
          <p>Yesterday the mail brought a thesis chapter from Nelson Hilton on Blake’s polysemous language, and when I returned to the task of one more try at the unsolved riddles of text the question that hung over this line was What polysemous word can fit here for South? I brought out my enlarged photographs of that part of the <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> page in all copies, and a piece of workable acetate, and the Concordance—where Blake’s winter letter to Hayley offered the perfect fit: South bounding! The bounce in "bounding" sets the South in motion, to leap over the Blakes’ thatch. A fine hypothesis: would Blake’s inscribed "bounding" fit the remnant edges of letters in the photographs? I am bound to confess that it delights me to say that it did; it does!</p>
          <pb id="p13-107" n="107"/>
          <p>Here is a full restoration—with semicolons added for the phrasing Blake seems to have wanted (though no punctuation can be recovered from this gouged abyss; see how he uses semicolons in line 42 of this page): [<hi rend="i">West Weighing; East &amp; North dividing Generation; South bounding</hi>]</p>

          <p>The history of Blake’s annotated copy of J. C. Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Aphorisms on Man</hi> (1788) provided by G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon, 1977), invites correction of some minute particulars. Bentley describes three stages in the history of the book:
<q>
(1) Blake made his notes when the sheets were not bound and showed them "to Fuseli; who said one could assuredly read their writer’s character in <hi rend="i">them</hi>";* (2) Acquired by Robert Hoe, who added his bookplate, and wrote a note now pasted in: "This copy which was Blake’s, had to be rebound; it was in broken sheepskin, and more than dirty. All the writing by Blake on the [<hi rend="i">back</hi>] fly leaves is carefully preserved. R. H."; sold posthumously with Hoe’s Library at Anderson Galleries, 25 April 1911, lot 396, for $1,525 to (3) The HUNTINGTON LIBRARY.<lb/><lb/>
*Gilchrist <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi> (1863), i. 62. He also showed them to John Linnell, who transcribed them into a copy of the 1794 edition now in Yale.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, p. 691; bracketed word and footnote in original
</q></p>
          <p>First of all, it was John Linnell <hi rend="i">Junior</hi> (seven years of age when Blake died in 1827) rather than his more famous father who transcribed with great care Blake’s underlinings and notes into a secondhand copy of the third edition of <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> (1794) now in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale.<ref target="n142" type="note">1</ref> In addition to the transcription John Linnell Junior wrote notes on the first and last endpapers of the book in which he identifies himself as the transcriber, dates the transcription 1874, and—most importantly—claims that Blake’s copy of <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> belonged to Samuel Palmer. The first endpaper reads: "John Linnell Jun<hi rend="s">r</hi>. . . . <hi rend="i">Blake’s notes</hi> in the orig[inal]. edit[ion]. belonging to S. Palmer Esq[uire] I have transcribed correctly in this edit[ion]. differences between this edit[ion]. &amp; the orig[inal]. I mark in <hi rend="i">red ink—W. Blake’s writing &amp; marks are in black ink</hi>[.]" The note on the last endpaper contains substantially the same information, with the addition of "J L. jun<hi rend="s">r</hi>. (1874)." <note id="n142"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Shelfmark Im/B581/Zz794. A previous owner, Eckermann, signed the book on endpaper 7<hi rend="s">r</hi>, wrote the date 17 Feb. 1829, and copied out two of Goethe’s comments on Lavater. Beneath these quotations, John Linnell Junior scrupulously noted: "The above writing was here when I bought this copy—(not in Blake’s edit[ion])." References to J. Knowles’s <hi rend="i">Life of Fuseli</hi> (1831) in the younger Linnell’s hand are on pp. vii and viii. According to an unattached acquisitions slip in the book, Yale purchased it from W. H. Robinson [the Dealer] on 20 Nov. 1942 for $15. I had hoped to find that an early transcription of Blake’s annotations preserved some of Blake’s notes not now legible in the original (Huntington 57431), but this proved not to be the case.</note></p>
          <p>Samuel Palmer’s ownership of Blake’s copy of <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> prior to Robert Hoe is supported by A. H. Palmer’s recollection of his father’s library, written in Blake’s copy of Boyd’s Dante:
<q>
This volume as far back as I can remember, stood upon one of my father’s [<hi rend="i">i.e., Samuel Palmer’s</hi>] book-shelves by the side of books annotated or illustrated by Blake. Among them was the now well-known copy of Lavater’s "Aphorisms" . . . <ref target="n143" type="note">2</ref><note id="n143"><hi rend="s">2</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Books</hi>, p. 686. A. H. Palmer’s undated note presumably dates from after his father’s death in 1881. The book is "now well-known" probably because of Gilchrist’s extensive quotation of Blake’s notes (I, 62-67), or perhaps because of the full but inaccurate transcription of Blake’s notes in E. J. Ellis, <hi rend="i">The Real Blake</hi> (1907), pp. 122-51.</note></q>
Samuel Palmer’s own testimony in a letter to Frederick G. Stephens would seem to settle the question of ownership:
<q>
See Lavater’s "Aphorisms", translated by Fuseli, I think. I cannot find my copy, which was doubly valuable as having belonged to the illustrious William Blake.

          <p>Occasionally works not by William Blake seem momentarily as intriguing and alluring as those genuinely by him. I offer three examples:</p>
          <p>(1) A letter said to be by our William Blake was listed in the American Art Association Catalogue of First Editions and Autographs of 13-14 March 1928, lot 37, with the explanation that it is "to his old friend John Thomas Smith." It reads:
<q>
Wed<hi rend="s">n</hi><lb/>
morn.<lb/>
24<hi rend="s">th</hi> Ap[<hi rend="i">ril 1811</hi>].<lb/>
My dear Sir,<lb/><lb/>
I am just returned from taking another look at the little picture of the Pope—<hi rend="i">it wont do for</hi> me upon <hi rend="i">any terms cheap or dear</hi>—<lb/><lb/>
Have the goodness therefore to inform M<hi rend="s">r</hi>. Christie that I have no wish to possess it—<lb/><lb/>
—I long for the Grimthorpe display—when we may hope to see a few genuine pictures in good condition— Ever yrs, my d<hi rend="s">r</hi> Sir,<lb/>
most cordially W B—
</q>
The picture in question seems to be (as the catalogue says) the one of Pope Leo X sold at Christies on 25 May 1811—and 24 April, when the letter was written, <hi rend="i">was</hi> a Wednesday in 1811. William Blake <hi rend="i">was</hi> a friend of J. T. Smith, who wrote a brief anecdotal life of him some years later (1828), and he was of course interested in pictures. But he certainly was not a buyer of such expensive pictures, especially in 1811 when his fortunes were at a particularly low ebb, and the handwriting of the letter (reproduced in the catalogue) is not his. Smith was doubtless being consulted in his capacity as Keeper of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum. I suggest that this W. B. the buyer may have been the opulent collector William Beckford.<ref target="n148" type="note">1</ref><note id="n148"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Another work signed "W B" attributed to our William Blake is an undated manuscript headed "Directions for ‘Landscape Painting’" (8 pp.), on preparing a palette, reproducing the effect of shadows, bark, etc. (Anderson Galleries, 3 April 1928, lot *13). The hand and contents are quite unlike Blake’s.</note></p>
          <p>(2) The letter of 15 June 1806 from Blake’s friend Ozias Humphry to "D<hi rend="s"><hi rend="u">r</hi></hi> William" quoted in <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> (1969), 178, is not to our William. The suggestion there that it is concerned with "applying for permission to dedicate his <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> designs to the Queen" (and this is the letter’s only clear connection with William Blake) is irrelevant, for this application to the Queen was not made until April 1807 (see "Blake and Cromek: The Wheat and the Tares," <hi rend="i">Modern Philology</hi>, 71 [1974], 566-79).</p>
          <p>(3) In <hi rend="i">The New Yorker</hi> for 26 February 1979, p. 3, and doubtless elsewhere, appeared an advertisement for Florence Eiseman, evidently a designer of children’s clothing, with the following inspirational motto:
<q>
To be a child is to live in a world where everything is new and exciting and beckoning us toward delight—<hi rend="i">William Blake</hi></q>
This somewhat flabby statement does not sound like Blake to me, and certainly Blake did not use either "exciting" or "beckoning" at all in his writings, according to the <hi rend="i">Concordance.</hi> Perhaps some hardpressed copy-writer thought Blake <hi rend="i">ought</hi> to have written it—or was companioned by Blake and was told it by him.</p>
          <p>Clearly the name of William Blake is an almost irresistible lure to authors of some auction catalogues, <hi rend="i">New Yorker</hi> advertisements, and <hi rend="i">Blake Records.</hi></p>

          <p>In note 34 to his interesting paper "Mr. Jacko ‘knows what riding is’ in 1785: dating Blake’s <hi rend="i">Island in the Moon</hi>" (<hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, 48 (xii, 4):250) R. J. Shroyer refers to Erdman’s statement that it is "hard to think who" Cumberland might be in <hi rend="i">An Island</hi> (<hi rend="i">Prophet</hi>, p. 100, fn. 22) and himself suggests that "it would seem logical to identify Cumberland with Quid on the evidence Erdman presents." I tentatively suggest that Cumberland, who was a professional "morocco man," may be identified as the Dean of Morocco. Stung by the poisonous honey-bee, Quid may well resent that an aim-at-your printer has had the nerve to invent a printing method which a cunning-sure like himself has been unable to develop. In the passage "Then," said he, "I would have all the writing Engraved instead of Printed, &amp; at every other leaf a high finish’d print—all in three Volumes folio—&amp; sell them a hundred pounds apiece. They would print off two thousand." Quid may well give good-humoured vent to his resentment, while at the same time indulging in self-irony.</p>
          <p>In a recent annotated translation of <hi rend="i">An Island</hi> into Swedish I daringly suggest-well aware of the fact that the suggested anagrammatical transformation yields a residue of N—that Nannicantipot is an anagram for <hi rend="i">Cannotpaint</hi>, a suitable epithet for Catherine who is said to have been able to neither read nor write at the time when she married William Blake. My suggestion that Sicknaker stands for <hi rend="i">Kick’n arse</hi> is highly tentative.</p>

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>Arnold Fawcus, who died in London in June 1979, aged sixty-one, was the owner of the Trianon Press in Paris and in that capacity has been for thirty years the mainspring of the William Blake Trust. By his premature death the Trustees have lost the highly skilled producer and trusted publisher of the quite remarkable series of books made in facsimile from Blake’s Illuminated Books and prints, together with a few from Samuel Palmer’s etchings and drawings. As Chairman of the Trust I have been parted from a wonderful friend.</p>
          <p>Arnold’s parentage was mixed British and American, his chief allegiance being to his American mother, but he somehow came to speak French with greater ease than English. His career began with a scholarship in history at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was also, in spite of his small stature, an athlete. This led to his becoming a leading exponent of the art of skiing and so, in the early days of the second world war, to working as instructor of American troops in Alpine warfare. Having completed this task he was for a time in doubt as to his further occupation, but then decided to join the American Secret Service. Presumably owing to his competence in the French language, he was set to identifying German spies in France. Working from London, he was entrusted with the Ultra-Secret concerning the reading of German codes. He was successful in this very special and romantic-sounding occupation, but was never in any danger and never killed anyone. Most of his spies were induced to work in a double capacity for their own advantage and so to the satisfaction of everyone—except perhaps the Enemy—but this they did not know.</p>
          <p>After the Armistice, Arnold was again in doubt how to use his talents, but eventually chose to embark on a business as publisher of fine books in color facsimile, using the technique of collotype prints colored by hand through stencils, a process developed only in Paris. He started with a younger partner, but soon preferred to carry on alone. I was always told he was "difficult to work with," this being clearly due to his built-in perfectionism, without which he could never have made a success of his exacting profession. At an early stage he had become involved in the production of facsimile reproductions of prehistoric cave paintings for the Abbé Breuil; the Abbé became so dependent on him, appreciating his integrity and skill, that he became in effect the Abbé’s adopted son, and inherited most of his wordly goods, with the duty of supporting the old man’s lifelong assistant, Miss Boyle, on the proceeds of his bequest, for as long as she lived.</p>
          <p>I came into contact with Arnold in 1948 through seeing in Boston a set of reproductions of watercolor drawings by Cézanne, which struck me as being just what I wanted for my projected facsimile of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> I accordingly sought out the Directors of the Trianon Press in Paris and we came to terms for the execution of the work. The result was the well known facsimile of Blake’s masterpiece, the unique colored copy of his last great Prophetic Poem (1951). From this time Arnold became the official producer and publisher for the Trustees of the Blake Trust, and my close friend. He continued to produce other books, notably the work on the Romanesque sculptures by Gilbertus at Autun Cathedral. This was a great success and served to restore to the French nation an outstanding work of art which seemed to have been forgotten. But his main preoccupation was working with all his creative concentration on the Blake Trust books.</p>
          <p>At the outset Arnold knew nothing about Blake and his work, but he soon became imbued with the same enthusiasm as ourselves and a determination to serve Blake and the aims of the Trustees as well as he knew how. The outcome of his efforts is there for all to see and forms in my estimation one of the most remarkable events ever seen in the history of fine book production, but it must be remembered that the Trust is an "Educational Charity" and that its achievements have only been made possible by the generosity of our American benefactors, who have wished to pay tribute to the creative powers of our English Blake.</p>
          <p>Arnold devoted thirty years of his life to the same cause and I am glad of this opportunity to record the gratitude of the Trustees to him for his matchless efforts on our behalf.</p>
          <figure/>
          <pb id="p13-111" n="111"/>
          <p>Arnold’s life-style consisted of many endearing eccentricities. He did not care to own stocks and shares, and made a little "profit" out of his efforts for the Trust. He preferred to have unusual properties such as a vintage Bugatti motor car and to live in derelict French chateaux. Thus he owned two enormous castles, one in the Jura and one in Burgundy. He made it his business gradually to restore them to viability and in Burgundy, as a sideline, he became internationally known as a grower of magnificent blue delphiniums, which people traveled many miles to see. This was done entirely for pleasure, not for gain. It was a joy to stay as his guest in these remarkable surroundings as I was allowed to do on many occasions. Any friend of Arnold’s was given many generous signs of his devotion. Being more than thirty years older than he, I became, as he told me, another of his adopted fathers.</p>
          <p>Arnold left unfinished four important productions for the Blake Trust. One, a facsimile of the manuscript of <hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon</hi>, with an essav by Dr. Michael Phillips, will soon be published. The three others, Lister’s <hi rend="i">Catalogue Raisonée</hi> of Palmer’s etchings with more than a hundred reproductions, the large package of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Book of Job</hi>, and Martin Butlin’s great <hi rend="i">Catalogue of Blake’s Works</hi> will follow during the next twelve months.</p>
          <p>Arnold’s widow, Julie, has bravely assumed the direction of the Trianon Press until these works are done. The William Blake Trust, its task completed, will then be terminated in its present form.</p>

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>On 29 September a public symposium entitled <hi rend="i">The English in Rome</hi> was held at the Yale Center for British Art. The program was designed to examine the cultural milieu of Rome at the end of the eighteenth century from the perspectives of various disciplines. The papers read focused not only on the artistic and physical environment encountered by the expatriates of this period but also on the environment of ideas. Concurrent with the symposium was an exhibit at the British Art Center, <hi rend="i">The Fuseli Circle in Rome.</hi> The exhibit was designed to assess and define the stylistic and thematic innovations of an international group of artists associated with Fuseli in Rome in the 1770s.</p>
          <p>A theoretical introduction to the subject of the symposium was presented by Frederick J. Cummings, Director, The Detroit Institute of Arts, who spoke on <hi rend="i">The Beginnings of Romanticism.</hi> Presented to enlarge the disciplinary scope of the program were <hi rend="i">Gibbon, Burke and the Sublime</hi> by Martin Price, Thomas E. Donnelly Professor of English, Yale University, and <hi rend="i">Roman Impressions: Some Personal Views</hi> by Patricia Meyer Spacks, Professor of English, Yale University. Following these papers was a public tour conducted by Nancy Pressly, Guest Curator for the exhibition.</p>
          <p>In the afternoon Jules David Prown, Professor of Art History, Yale University, discussed the ramifications of Rome and the antique in <hi rend="i">Benjamin West, Antiquity, and the American Indian. Fuseli’s Use of the Antique</hi> was presented by Gert Schiff, Professor of Fine Arts, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. The Center’s Curator of Prints and Drawings, Andrew Wilton, ended the papers with <hi rend="i">William Pars in Rome.</hi></p>
