          <p>What G. E. Bentley once called “the decent ignorance which still
                        obscures Blake’s family”<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref>
                        is still far from dispelled. The ages and even the identities of the Blake
                        children have been especially problematic. Among his nineteenth-century
                        biographers, Alexander Gilchrist mentioned only three of Blake’s
                        siblings and knew the names of only two; J. T. Smith and Allan
                        Cunningham’s information was still scantier, and B. H. Malkin spoke
                        only of Blake’s father among his family members.<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> Frederick Tatham in his manuscript <hi rend="i">Life
                            of Blake</hi> gave the names though not the birthdates of Blake’s
                        four surviving siblings but got their birth order wrong.<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> However, his <hi rend="i">Life</hi> was not known to
                        Gilchrist and the other early biographers: it did not come to light till
                        1864, after Gilchrist’s death, and was referred to only casually by
                        Swinburne and E. J. Ellis; it was in fact not published till A. G. B.
                        Russell’s 1906 edition of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Letters.</hi><ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> No doubt it was this
                        publication that spurred Arthur Symons to search the St. James Parish
                        register, where in 1907 he discovered the names and birthdates of six
                        children of James and Catherine Blake: James, born 10 July 1753; John, born
                        12 May 1755; William, born 28 November 1757; a second John, born 20 March
                        1760; Richard, born 19 June 1762; and Catherine, born 7 January 1764.<ref target="n5" type="note">5</ref> All six were duly baptized a few weeks
                        after birth. But Symons’s discovery raised almost as many questions
                        as it answered. The duplication of the name John could be <figure><head>1. <hi rend="i">A Naked Youth Seen from the Side, Perhaps Robert
                                    Blake</hi>, c. 1779-80 (Butlin 71).</head><figDesc>Reproduced by permission of the Trustees of the British
                                Museum.</figDesc></figure> explained by the assumption that the first John died in infancy,
                        though there is no record of his death. Blake himself, in describing the
                        second John as “the evil one” (E 721), left no doubt of his
                        existence, but almost nothing is know of his life.<ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref> The name of Richard is another puzzle, since he is
                        never mentioned again in the Blake records. If, like the first John, he died
                        in infancy, this fact is not recorded, although the death or burial dates of
                        young children are found fairly often in parish registers of the
                        time—witness those of four young siblings of Catherine Boucher
                            Blake.<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> And most puzzling of all,
                        nowhere in the St. James Parish register is the birth or baptism of
                        Blake’s beloved younger brother Robert to be found. <note id="n1"><hi rend="s">1</hi> G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>

          <p>Robert’s absence from the record remains the most controverted
                        question about the makeup of Blake’s family. Symons answered it by
                        suggesting that the parish clerk made a careless mistake in entering
                        Robert’s name as Richard at the time of <pb id="p28-85" n="85"/><figure><head>2. <hi rend="i">The Approach of Doom.</hi></head><figDesc>Relief and white-line etching. Reproduced by permission of the

                        recording the name of Blake’s father as John, not James, at the birth
                        of the first John in 1755. This plausible supposition satisfied Blake
                        scholars—including Mona Wilson and Geoffrey Keynes<ref target="n8" type="note">8</ref>—for over 50 years. Then in 1969 Bentley
                        offered a new explanation of the omission of Robert from the parish records.
                        In the roster of the Royal Academy Schools he discovered a Robert Blake
                        enrolled as a student of engraving in April 1782 and described as having
                        been “14 last 4th August”—i.e., born in 1767. This he
                        conjectured was in all probability Blake’s youngest brother, five
                        years younger than hitherto supposed.<ref target="n9" type="note">9</ref> To

                        daughter’s birth in 1764 James Blake Sr. joined the Baptist Church
                        and so never had the infant Robert baptized. In support of this theory he
                        noted that one “—Blake” (no Christian name given) was
                        listed among the members of the Grafton Street Baptist Church from 1769 to
                            1772<ref target="n10" type="note">10</ref>—two years after the
                        conjectured date of Robert’s birth, it should be noted. While Bentley
                        thought it possible that the Royal Academy student was not related to Blake,
                        he dismissed the idea as “unlikely,” seeing “no good
                        reason to challenge [the] accuracy” of the entry as “the only
                        record of the birthdate of Blake’s favorite brother.” And from
                        the time of the publication of his <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> this
                        hypothesis has been almost unanimously accepted as the solution to the

          <p>And yet some doubts remain. A number of small facts or inferences—none
                        of them decisive evidence taken singly, but certainly suggestive in their
                        totality—point in another direction. First of all, the assumption
                        that the Robert Blake who entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1782 was in
                        fact Blake’s youngest brother is questionable, given the
                        “hosts of Blakes” living in London at the time.<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> Bentley himself collected some 23
                        London contemporaries who bore the name of William Blake, one of whom was
                        also an engraver, and today “Robert Blakes” are at least as
                        common as “Williams.”<ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref>
                        This profusion of Blakes also undermines the probability of the nameless
                        “Blake” of the Grafton Street Baptist Church being
                        Blake’s father, the premise of Bentley’s explanation for the
                        absence of a baptismal record for Robert. Furthermore, it is striking that
                        not one of Blake’s early biographers—neither Malkin, to whom
                        Blake described his own experience at the Academy, nor Smith, who knew
                        Robert personally, nor Tatham, who got his information mainly from Catherine
                            Blake<ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref>—spoke of
                        Robert’s studying at the Royal Academy Schools, certainly a
                        noteworthy event if it actually occurred. And if, as seems likely, Blake
                        continued attending the Schools for a full six year term after his admission
                        in 1779,<ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref> the brothers’
                        overlapping terms would be a still more notable circumstance—though
                        if, as is generally assumed, Blake left the Academy in disgust after a few
                        months, it is hard to see why Robert would have decided to apply there two
                        years later. Nor can Robert’s surviving drawings be taken as evidence
                        of Academy tutelage. While his work reveals some genuine talent, not unlike
                        Blake’s own in theme and mood, it is an undeveloped one, showing
                        neither the precocious ability that would have gained him admission to the
                        Academy at the unusually early age of 14 nor the influence of Academy
                        training thereafter<ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref>—though of

          <p>Yet since it appears that Blake at some point tutored Robert in
                        drawing—“a task which he must have found above all others
                        delightful”—this has been taken to imply that the older
                        brother was preparing the younger to qualify for admission to the
                            Academy.<ref target="n17" type="note">17</ref> This would seem to
                        strengthen the likelihood that Robert was actually the student of engraving
                        admitted to the Schools in 1782, and indeed it appears a remarkable
                        coincidence that two Robert Blakes both born in the 1760s should both be
                        training as engravers at the same time.<ref target="n18" type="note">18</ref> Yet a number of similar duplications occur in the roster of
                        the Royal Academy Schools which—like that of Blake’s namesake
                        engraver—considerably diminish the coincidentality.<ref target="n19" type="note">19</ref> As for Blake’s teaching Robert, the story
                        stems from Smith’s mention that William “considered him
                        [Robert] his pupil” around the time Blake opened his printshop with
                            Parker,<ref target="n20" type="note">20</ref> and since the discovery of
                        the name of Robert Blake in the Academy roster it has been fortified by
                        reference to the <hi rend="i">Robert Blake Sketch Book</hi>, first described
                        by Geoffrey Keynes in 1949.<ref target="n21" type="note">21</ref> This
                        rather decrepit notebook containing about 50 pages of drawings is inscribed
                        “Robert Blake’s / 1777 Book” on the front cover, with
                        similar signatures elsewhere and seven occurrences of the date 1778.<ref target="n22" type="note">22</ref> Many of the pages contain competent
                        sketches of various parts of the human body on the left hand side,
                        apparently by some instructor, with rather hesitant copies filling up the
                        rest of the page, progressing from lips, noses, eyes, hands, arms and legs
                        to faces, busts and full figures.<ref target="n23" type="note">23</ref>
                        Despite some awkwardness, especially in the early pages,, the work shows
                        real ability for a 10 or 11 year old boy. He was evidently aiming at a kind
                        of academic realism: later pages include heads of women with
                        eighteenth-century hats and hairstyles as well as carefully detailed
                        drawings of birds, animals and a rural scene. But his pedestrian manner
                        contrasts strongly with the abstract and archaic but imaginatively
                        expressive figures of the authentic drawings by Blake’s brother found
                        in the Notebook of William Blake and elsewhere, and indeed the drawings that
                        served as the boy’s models have a more assured and detailed grasp of
                        human anatomy than Blake’s own work at the time.<ref target="n24" type="note">24</ref> It is hard to see these sketches as the work of
                        either William or Robert. A final argument against linking the Sketch Book
                        to Blake’s teaching Robert in 1777-78 is the date implied in
                        Smith’s account—that the lessons occurred during
                        Blake’s partnership in the printshop, i.e., around 1784, two years
                        after Robert’s supposed entrance at the Schools and not, as Bentley
                        suggests, prior to his enrollment.<ref target="n25" type="note">25</ref>
                        Whatever the instruction amounted to, its purpose was probably to train
                        Robert as an assistant with his engraving, as Blake later did with
                        Catherine—a supposition which gives point to the vision of Robert
                        later providing Blake with his most valuable trade secret. <note id="n17"><hi rend="s">17</hi><hi rend="i"> BR</hi> 29 and 20.</note><note id="n18"><hi rend="s">18</hi> As G. E. Bentley has argued in

          <p>Although Keynes and Butlin accept the attribution of the Sketch Book to

                        suspicious. The note claimed <pb id="p28-88" n="88"/> onetime friend Thomas
                        Stothard after his death in 1834 and again in the sale of Sir Alexander
                        Spearman’s books in 1878; thereafter it disappeared, to surface again
                        in 1919 when it was purchased for the Huntington Library.<ref target="n27" type="note">27</ref> However, it was not listed among the 1500 items in
                        the catalogue of the Stothard sale or (apparently) in that of the Spearman
                            sale.<ref target="n28" type="note">28</ref> Wherever it came from, the
                        book was not linked to Blake’s brother Robert till a century after
                        his death by its nameless late nineteenth-century owner, whose note may not
                        have been a deliberate fabrication so much as a bit of wishful thinking.
                        Moreover, there is no reason to think that Blake would have given Stothard
                        such a treasured memento as this Sketch Book if indeed it was his
                        brother’s: there is no evidence of a close friendship between Robert
                        and Stothard, but rather a seven if not a 12-year difference in age, and
                        Blake had ceased collaborating with Stothard a year before Robert’s
                        death, perhaps as a result of a cooling of their friendship.<ref target="n29" type="note">29</ref> All in all, it is a more likely guess
                        that the book belonged to the other Robert Blake—the precocious lad
                        who entered the Royal Academy Schools at 14. <note id="n26"><hi rend="s">26</hi> Keynes 4-5; Butlin I: 617; Bindman 232n3; Essick, <hi rend="i">Huntington</hi> 235-36.</note><note id="n27"><hi rend="s">27</hi> Butlin 1: 617; Keynes 5-6.</note><note id="n28"><hi rend="s">28</hi><hi rend="i"> BB</hi> 656 and cf. 661, where the Spearman sale is not

          <p>If then Blake’s youngest brother was not the Robert Blake enrolled in
                        the Schools in 1782, who was he, or rather when was he born? The
                        preponderant evidence seems to point back to Symons’s
                        conjecture—that he was in fact the mysterious Richard Blake conjured
                        into being in June 1762 by a slip of the parish clerk’s pen. Several
                        other considerations support this hypothesis. First of all, the absence of a
                        death record for Richard Blake (or any other record subsequent to that of
                        his birth) suggests that a child of that name never existed. That a death
                        record is also lacking for the first John is not material: he may have died
                        elsewhere than in London, as Bentley suggests, or even have been the son not
                        of James but of John Blake, the father’s name given in the entry of
                        his birth, and lived to maturity for all we know.<ref target="n30" type="note">30</ref> Second, Blake’s mother, who was born around
                        1722, would have been 45 in 1767, the supposed date of Robert’s
                        birth: a not impossible age for child-bearing, but an improbable one,
                        especially considering that this would have been her seventh child. Again,
                        the close intimacy between William and Robert, which probably dates from
                        Blake’s return home at the end of his apprenticeship in 1779, is far
                        more likely to have been based on a five than a 10 year’s difference
                        in age. The “Academy study” of a naked youth seen from the
                        side, dated c. 1779-80, which Keynes took to be a portrait of Robert
                        represents a youth of about 17 or 18, not a boy of 12:<ref target="n31" type="note">31</ref> and though both date and identification are
                        tentative, this too would support a birth date for Robert of 1762 rather
                        than 1767.<ref target="n32" type="note">32</ref><note id="n30"><hi rend="s">30</hi> Bentley raises this second possibility
                            only to argue against it (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 3n3). It should be noted
                            that eighteenth-century parish records are far from complete, and the
                            definitive central register at Somerset House of all births and deaths
                            occurring in Great Britain was not established till the passage of the
                            Births and Deaths Registration Act in 1836 (<hi rend="i">Encyclopaedia

                            is Bentley’s own <hi rend="i">Blake Records.</hi> Unfortunately
                            the other Robert Blake (born in August 1767) is not listed anywhere in

                            Genealogical Register relies on fragmentary parish records for its
                            information.</note></p>
          <p>The most telling argument against the Bentley hypothesis, however, is the
                        fact that the only two early biographers to mention Robert’s age at
                        the time of his death in February 1787 both gave it as 24: Tatham, whose
                        information came from Blake’s widow, and Gilchrist, who never saw
                        Tatham’s <hi rend="i">Life</hi> and relied on other informants such
                        as Linnell and Palmer, both of whom knew Blake well.<ref target="n33" type="note">33</ref> By this <pb id="p28-89" n="89"/> account, Robert
                        must have been born sometime between February 1762 and February 1763.
                        Apparently it was their independent testimony that persuaded Symons that the
                        name of Richard in the parish register for June 1762 must have been a
                        clerical error for Robert; and indeed their record of Robert’s age at
                        death is in the end the only explicit evidence we have for his
                            birthdate.<ref target="n34" type="note">34</ref><note id="n33"><hi rend="s">33</hi> Tatham in <hi rend="i">BR</hi> 510;
                            Gilchrist 51. Gilchrist placed Robert’s death “in his
                            twenty-fifth year,” i.e., a few months before his twenty-fifth
                            birthday in June. Bentley noted this testimony but was not convinced by
                            it (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 31, 510n1); yet the congruence of two
                            independent records is impressive. That Gilchrist had not seen
                            Tatham’s <hi rend="i">Life</hi> seems clear from internal
                            evidence. His few direct citations of Tatham mostly concern matters not
                            mentioned in Tatham’s own <hi rend="i">Life</hi> (cf. <hi rend="i">LWB</hi> 261, 366) and often appear to be based on oral
                            reports (e.g. <hi rend="i">LWB</hi> 352); but where Gilchrist discusses
                            matters which are included in Tatham’s <hi rend="i">Life</hi> his
                            account either significantly departs from Tatham’s (cp. <hi rend="i">LWB</hi> 10 and <hi rend="i">BR</hi> 511, <hi rend="i">LWB</hi> 81 and <hi rend="i">BR</hi> 530, <hi rend="i">LWB</hi> 355
                            and <hi rend="i">BR</hi> 534) or contradicts it (<hi rend="i">LWB</hi>
                            85 and <hi rend="i">BR</hi> 521) or is attributable to another source
                            (cp. <hi rend="i">LWB</hi> 31-32 and <hi rend="i">BR</hi> 517 and 459,
                                <hi rend="i">LWB</hi> 351 and <hi rend="i">BR</hi> 471). Though
                            Gilchrist’s account of Blake’s midnight composition seems
                            to derive from Tatham (cp. <hi rend="i">LWB</hi> 31-32 and <hi rend="i">BR</hi> 526n1), the unnamed “cordially appreciative
                            friend” who supplied Gilchrist with this and much of his other
                            information is almost certainly Samuel Palmer in one of his frequent
                            discussions with Gilchrist of matters probably familiar to all the
                            Ancients. Gilchrist’s mentions of Tatham are infrequent and
                            perfunctory compared with his own many cordial references to Palmer (cf.
                                <hi rend="i">LWB</hi> 299). Thus, while Tatham’s information
                            about Robert’s age at death was no doubt supplied by Catherine,
                            with whom he bacame familiar after Blake’s death,
                            Gilchrist’s most probably derived from Blake himself through
                            Palmer.</note><note id="n34"><hi rend="s">34</hi> Bentley points out in correspondence
                            that even the evidence of a death date is not definitive: Blake’s
                            brother James’s age at death is given wrongly as 71 in the
                            perfunctory six-word entry in the Bunhill Fields Burial register when he
                            as actually 73 and a half (cf. <hi rend="i">BR</hi> 340 and n4).
                            However, James’s death was not the subject of any biographical
                            interest that would have corrected the record, while Robert’s
                            death was a matter of concern to Blake’s early biographers.
                            Unfortunately his age is not given in the Bunhill Fields register as
                            quoted by Bentley (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 32). I wish to thank Professor
                            Bentley for his generosity in reading the final draft of this article
                            and offering perceptive criticism on this and other matters.</note></p>
          <p>Thus when all aspects of the question are considered, the conclusion seems
                        almost inescapable: Robert was born in June 1762, not August 1767, and a
                        slip of the pen accounts for the confusion over his name. More than merely
                        revising the record, however, this investigation underscores a basic
                        principle of biography. A single document, however impressive its
                        credentials, cannot establish a fact apart from its total narrative context.
                        The entry from the Schools register remains a tantalizing but isolated item,
                        unsupported by any firm corroborative evidence, among the myriad minute
                        particulars which the biographer of Blake must sift and assemble. Written
                        evidence, while it can provide uniquely valuable information, can also be
                        mistaken or misleading, and must therefore be scrutinized as carefully as
                        all other kinds; conversely, non-verbal evidence may be admitted even where
                        it appears to contradict the written evidence. In short, documentary
                        evidence should not be privileged to the exclusion of all other kinds; we
                        should remember how little of any life finds its way into written accounts,
                        and keep our minds open to the mute testimony of things and circumstances
                        and inferences from them. Every piece of biographical evidence, documentary
                        or otherwise, must be viewed against the total experience of the
                        biographical subject. It is the living context of each event that shapes
                        isolated records into the semblance of biographical truth.</p>

          <p>The rejected “thee” of the fourth line of “To

          <p>This group suggests Mary and Martha of Bethany with their brother Lazarus<ref target="n36" type="note">2</ref> already decomposing, as Martha warns
                        Jesus (John 11.39). Indeed the central figure resembles Lazarus in
                        Blake’s painting of <hi rend="i">The Raising of Lazarus</hi> in
                        Aberdeen (B 487), in that Lazarus is emerging from the ground (not the
                        sepulchre mentioned in John 11.38-41) and seems to be half in and half out
                        of the grave. Certainly the inscription on the robes of the old man bending
                        over the corpse—“It is raised a spiritual body” (1

                        Lazarus as a spiritual resurrection misinterpreted by a materialistic church

                            fully with the implications of the Lazarus story. Mellor says of this
                            design “an old man pours a reviving. baptismal water upon a
                            corpse held by two women. This iconographic fusion of the descent from
                            the cross and the raising of Lazarus is summed up in the lines engraved
                            upon the old man’s robe—‘It is raised a Spiritual
                            Body.’ Mortal existence is totally evil; only through death can
                            fallen man be freed from his corrupted human form and redeemed a s a
                            spiritual, purified body” (p.189) Lincoln, who foregrounds the
                            negative reading of the design allows that “seen as an image of
                            redemption the design shows humanity “Raised a Spiritual Body,
                            “brought back from the grave like Lazarus (whose two sisters had
                            faith in his resurrection,” but qualifies this by saying that
                            “the Saviour who presides over this vision of Liberty is not
                            Jesus but his Father, the God who promotes the vision of human nature as

          <p>This dialogue follows closely the gospel version of the exchange between

                        in Night the Seventh the daughters of Beulah find comfort in these same
                        words in the face of death when they write on “all their tombs &amp;
                        pillars &amp; on every Urn” the eternal promise “If ye will
                        believe your B[r]other shall rise again” (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi>
                        87.4-6, E 367). The daughters of Beulah are still identified with the
                        sisters of Bethany in Night the Eighth when in praising the Lamb of God
                        “they anoint his feet with ointment they wipe them with the hair of
                        their head” (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi> 113.37, E 377) just as Mary of
                        Bethany tends Jesus in the brief interval in John’s gospel between
                        the raising of Lazarus and the passion narrative (12.3). Flowing hair is a
                        distinguishing mark of Mary of Bethany (as of Mary Magdalene), and in the
                        “To Tirzah” design, as in <hi rend="i">The Raising of
                            Lazarus</hi>, the two women are distinguished by their hair, one loose
                        and flowing and the other bound or (in the painting) covered. <note id="n38"><hi rend="s">4</hi> Johnson and Wilkie note that Mary and Martha

          <p>The old man offering a pitcher is more mysterious. He looks like the Ancient
                        Bard in “The Voice of the Ancient Bard,” which follows soon
                        after “To Tirzah” in seven copies of the <hi rend="i">Songs of
                            Experience</hi>, but also resembles Blake’s portrayals of Joseph
                        of Arimathea, with his long hair, long beard and robes: this is how Joseph
                        is represented in three of the four versions of <hi rend="i">Joseph of
                            Arimathea Preaching to the Inhabitants of Britain</hi> (B 262, 286,
                            780).<ref target="n39" type="note">5</ref> He is long-haired, bearded
                        and old in two other paintings, <hi rend="i">The Body of Christ Borne to the
                            Tomb</hi> (B 426) and <hi rend="i">The Entombment</hi> (B 427). Joseph
                        is associated with the dead body of Jesus, as the follower who takes him
                        away for burial. If the old man in the “To Tirzah” design is
                        Joseph of Arimathea, Mellor’s suggestion of “an iconographic
                        fusion of the raising of Lazarus and the descent from the cross”
                        (189) is strengthened. <note id="n39"><hi rend="s">5</hi> In the other
                            version he is shown naked, but bearded and old (B 76).</note></p>
          <p>Joseph of Arimathea is associated not only with British Christianity but also
                        with the figure of the artist, for Blake sees him as “One of the
                        Gothic Artists who Built the Cathedrals in what we call the Dark
                        Ages” (E 671).<ref target="n40" type="note">6</ref> The dead man
                        (Lazarus) is thus possibly flanked by, on the one hand Mary and Martha, and
                        on the other hand by Joseph of Arimathea; that is on the one hand by two
                        women identified by Blake as daughters of Beulah, and thus as Muses, and on
                        the other hand by the image of the Gothic artist. If both Joseph of
                        Arimathea and the sisters of Lazarus are too concerned with physical death
                        in the biblical narratives that concern them, all three believe in the power
                        of Jesus and are associated with what can transform their vision, the work
                        of the arts. Thus indeed in this design the sexes rise “to work and
                        weep” (8). Work after all is essentially redemptive in the poems that
                        are roughly contemporary with “To Tirzah” and with the Joseph
                        of Arimathea inscription.<ref target="n41" type="note">7</ref><note id="n40"><hi rend="s">6</hi> Presumably this is why Bindman speaks of
                            him as a figure of the artist (124).</note><note id="n41"><hi rend="s">7</hi> Erdman implies that the date of
                            “To Tirzah” is approximately 1803-06 (800). The Joseph of
                            Arimathea inscription is from 1809-10 (889). <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                            and <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, texts in which work is central, date from
                            approximately 1804-15 (809) and 1804-10 (806) respectively.</note></p>
          <p>The first three lines of “To Tirzah” may thus be read as words
                        of comfort in that they speak not only of the certainty of death and
                        corruption but also of the certainty of rising again spiritually: and the
                        design addresses this element in the poem.<ref target="n42" type="note">8</ref> These lines are an affirmation followed by a strong rejection:
                        the words of the fourth line are as abrupt <pb id="p28-91" n="91"/> and
                        disconcerting in the poem as they are in their original biblical context.
                        The various verbal elements of the poem—the harshness of these
                        repeated words, their added impact as Jesus’ own words, their
                        allusion to the mother of Jesus, the later address to “thou Mother of
                        my Mortal part” (9), the knowledge that Tirzah is elsewhere (<hi rend="i">Milton</hi> 19:49-60, E 113; <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                        67:44-51, E 221) the cruel imprisoner of the senses, the apparent clumsiness
                        of the repetition in the first line (born, birth)—all work together
                        to foreground birth as death. Read as a visual text, however, the poem with
                        its greater complexity of biblical allusion—referring not only to the
                        Jesus who denies his mother and dies as an act of liberation, but also to
                        the Jesus who loves his friends and whose death leads to the life of a
                        “spiritual body”—addresses death as birth. This sense
                        is strengthened by the allusion to the story of Lazarus in the second
                        stanza: “Mercy changed Death into Sleep” (7). Jesus the
                        merciful, the forgiver of sins, associates the death of Lazarus with sleep
                        when speaking to his disciples: “Our friend Lazarus sleepeth, but I
                        go, that I may awake him out of sleep” (John 11.11). The rising from
                        such a sleep ends <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and is besought by the bard
                        who introduces the <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience.</hi><note id="n42"><hi rend="s">8</hi> Erdman seems to prefer such a
                            “hopeful vision” suggesting that we could “see the
                            two women and the pitcher-offering old man . . . as spiritual comforters
                            . . . . As the “Mortal part” is consumed, the
                            “Spiritual Body” is welcomed into the garden, and love
                            does give support” (IB94).</note></p>
          <p>The fourth and the last eight lines of the poem are so absolute in their
                        rejection of the maternal and the natural<ref target="n43" type="note">9</ref> that they have often obscured the other implications of both
                        song and design. Thus the female figures have been seen as necessarily
                        negative—as useless Sex-Love and Mother-Love (Keynes 52), as
                        “Tirzah-like” figures (Lincoln 201), or as Rahab and Tirzah
                        (Lindsay 83). Yet while “the extreme hostility and contempt for the
                        female and the maternal” as Mary Lynn Johnson says (61) cannot be
                        easily dismissed, the presence of the sisters of Bethany in the design
                        suggests not the overpowering anger of the third and fourth stanzas, but the
                        power of belief and the power of human art. <note id="n43"><hi rend="s">9</hi> Such a connection and rejection of the maternal and the
                            natural is an aspect of various religious traditions: E. P. Thompson,
                            discussing contemporary views of the <hi rend="i">humanum maternum</hi>,
                            says of “To Tirzah” that “if we set aside the
                            enigmatic second verse, might be an expression of orthodox Swedenborgian
                            doctrine” (148). He also describes the poem as employing
                            “the imagery of the feminine principle (the womb) clothing,
                            enclosing, and binding the spirit in a way which Muggletonians as well
                            as neo-Platonists would have understood” (81).</note></p>
          <p>Rajan speaks of this song’s “deeply pessimistic
                        antinaturalism” (222); Leader sees it as “the Bard’s
                        nadir” (202); Lincoln’s long and judicious discussion of the
                        poem suggests that it can be seen in two ways, either as showing “a
                        clarification of vision” or as emphasizing the death of Jesus, which
                        emphasis “may confirm the power of Tirzah by reinforcing a
                        self-denying attitude” (201). I would add this qualification: the
                        figures of Mary and Martha of Bethany (and perhaps of Joseph of Arimathea)
                        in the design, together with the obligation “to work”
                        (“and weep”) in the text suggest that the song is not a pure
                        rejection of human life. Art remains, work remains (as the last plate of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> shows Los and Enitharmon still laboring at the
                        forge and the loom). If as Lincoln suggests “as the fruits [on the
                        tree in the design] indicate, the myth of Eden predominates here”
                        then Adam’s biblical curse—work—is seen here as his
                        blessing. The preceding reading is intended not so much to elucidate as to
                        complicate: after all, the song itself, like “The Tyger” (but
                        with no final modification), ends with a repetition of its initial
                        question.</p>

            <title>A Possible Corollary Source for <hi rend="i">The Gates of

          <p>In the course of examining Gerda S. Norvig’s new study, <hi rend="i">Dark Figures in the Desired Country: Blake’s Illustrations to
                            The Pilgrim’s Progress</hi>, I was struck by the author’s
                        discussion of plate 10 of Blake’s 1793 <hi rend="i">The Gates of
                            Paradise</hi> (“Help! Help!”), which discussion echoes
                        David V. Erdman’s earlier argument that a strong connection exists
                        between this plate and the preceding one (“I Want! I Want!”),
                        and a well-known caricature print by James Gillray from the same year, <hi rend="i">The Slough of Despond.</hi><ref target="n44" type="note">1</ref> Norvig argues that Gillray deliberately invoked the context of
                            <hi rend="i">Pilgrim’s Progress</hi>, both in his explicit
                        citation of Bunyan’s title (in the title he inscribed at the bottom
                        of the print) and in the verbal and iconographic details he included, and
                        that Blake’s subsequent engravings are therefore indebted both to
                        Gillray and to Bunyan. While both the visual correspondences in
                        Blake’s two engravings (like the similar shapes of the land masses in
                        the distance in the Gillray and “Help! Help!”) and the verbal
                        connections between their captions and Gillray’s print (especially
                        the recurrence of the phrase, “Help! Help!”) certainly support
                        the suggestion that Blake had Gillray’s print in mind, another visual
                        precedent may well be involved here as well. <note id="n44"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Gerda S. Norvig, <hi rend="i">Dark Figures in the Desired

          <p>In 1778 the American painter John Singleton Copley’s remarkable
                        painting, <hi rend="i">Watson and the Shark</hi>, became the sensation of
                        that year’s exhibition at the Royal Academy of Art. A contemporary
                        critic fairly brimmed over with praise: “We heartily congratulate our
                        Countrymen on a Genius, who bids fair to rival the great Masters of the
                        Ancient Italian Schools.”<ref target="n45" type="note">2</ref> While
                        Blake was not formally admitted to the Royal Academy Schools until 8 October
                            1779,<ref target="n46" type="note">3</ref> it seems scarcely credible
                        that he could have been unaware of the painting that had achieved such
                        popular success in the previous year’s exhibition. Moreover, Copley
                        profited from the large <figure><head>1. William Blake, <hi rend="i">For Children: The Gates of
                                    Paradise</hi>, plate 10.</head><figDesc>Ca. 1 ¾ × 2 ⅛ inches. Library of
                                Congress.</figDesc></figure> number of engravings made after his picture,<ref target="n47" type="note">4</ref> and it is therefore reasonable to assume that Blake
                        likely knew the picture in both versions. The original painting (Copley
                        painted a near-duplicate, which he never sold, and several years later a
                        smaller, vertical version) was commissioned by Brook Watson, the Watson of
                        the title who, appearances notwithstanding, survived the shark’s
                        attack although it cost him a leg, and who left the painting to
                        Christ’s Hospital when he died. The engraved version of
                        Copley’s picture was published in 1779, “seemingly with very
                        good success,” by Valentine Green, the successful engraver who also
                        prepared engraved versions of other Copley paintings like the 1782 engraving
                        after the full-length portrait of Henry Laurens that was intended as a
                        companion-piece to a portrait of George Washington also engraved by

                        Copley’s work generally became apparent again later as well, when on

          <p>The struggling figure in Blake’s “Help! Help!” bears
                        striking visual resemblances to Copley’s figure of the endangered and
                        seemingly helpless Brook Watson, which figure is itself borrowed from the
                        figure of a helpless child in Raphael’s last altarpiece.<ref target="n50" type="note">7</ref> The relationship of Blake’s
                        little figure to Copley’s monumental one becomes even more striking
                        when we recall that in reproductive engraving the engraver generally
                        reverses the right-left orientation of his or her original, which in this
                        case would produce a figure very much like that which Blake has drawn,
                        complete with dramatically extended hand and with hair streaming out and
                        away in the water from the figure’s head. The waves in Blake’s
                        engraving are likewise much like those in Copley’s painting. Norvig
                        makes much of the curious <pb id="p28-94" n="94"/> unidentified object that
                        bobs on the crest of the wave to the right of the man’s arm in
                        Blake’s engraving. I have no idea, either, of what this is supposed
                        to be, nor does either the painted or the engraved version of
                        Copley’s picture offer any useful guidance. There is something there,
                        certainly, perhaps a bobber or flotation device of some sort (the specks on
                        the object might be taken to suggest the texture of cork, for instance).
                        Even under magnification, however, the object refuses to divulge its
                        identity with any certainty. <note id="n50"><hi rend="s">7</hi> Williams
                            30.</note></p>
          <p>Finally, a clear thematic connection exists between the two images. In the
                        Copley the figure of Watson (whose vulnerability is underscored by his being
                        rendered naked) is seemingly faced with imminent destruction: the various
                        efforts of would-be rescuers appear to be both ineffective and too late.
                        Even the life-line that has been offered Watson proves valueless, draped as
                        it is across the extended forearm of the unresponsive Watson. Blake’s
                        engraving only makes physically explicit (by actually isolating the
                        struggling figure) what is implicit in Copley’s painting: the
                        apparently total inability of the struggling figure to help, or to save,
                        himself. Whether we take Geoffrey Keynes’ word that Blake’s
                        emblem is “self-explanatory”—that it depicts
                        “Man drowning helplessly in the materialistic Sea of Time and
                        Space”—or whether we go further and agree with Gerda Norvig
                        that the engraving asserts that drowning in the disappointed recognition
                        that what one desires is out of reach constitutes “the next critical
                        stage in the integration of the whole man,”<ref target="n51" type="note">8</ref> the fact remains that both Blake’s image and
                        Copley’s portray individuals in desperate straits indeed. That
                        Copley’s Watson cannot be helped by his friends would have been less
                        important to Blake—though he would have appreciated the
                        pathos—than the fact that he cannot help himself, as the neglected
                        life-line indicates. It is this thematic connection that seems to me to
                        underscore the validity of recognizing in Blake’s apparent borrowing
                        from <hi rend="i">Watson and the Shark</hi> a connotation that is
                        intellectual as well as merely iconographical. <note id="n51"><hi rend="s">8</hi> William Blake, <hi rend="i">The Gates of Paradise</hi>, ed.

          <p>A visit to an exhibition of Brown’s choice holdings has led to the
                        recognition of five printed plates from Blake’s illuminated books
                        that had been untraced: a single leaf bearing on its front and back
                        uncolored impressions of plates 11 (“Arise O Rintrah . . .”)
                        and 17 (“Ethinthus Queen of Waters . . .”) from the assemblage
                        called copy c of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> and three leaves from the
                        posthumous copy o of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> bearing uncolored pulls of
                        plates 13 (“The Little Boy lost”), 20 and 21 (the first and
                        second plates of “Night”). These items, along with a
                        posthumous pull of Blake’s wood engraving XIII for Thornton’s
                            <hi rend="i">Virgil</hi>, 1874 restrikes of plates 15 and 20 of the <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of Job</hi>, and a Colnaghi restrike
                        of the fifth state of Blake’s engraving of <hi rend="i">Chaucers
                            Canterbury Pilgrims</hi>, are now in the Koopman collection in the John
                        Hay Library at Brown University. All were given to Brown by Philip D.
                        Sherman, an Oberlin professor and Brown alumnus who died in 1957, as part of
                        a huge collection that he named in honor of Koopman, a Brown librarian. G.
                        E. Bentley, Jr., Robert N. Essick, Mary Lynn Johnson, Charles Ryskamp,
                        Joseph Viscomi, and the staff of the John Hay Library (especially Jennifer
                        Lee) helped me to make sense of these discoveries.</p>
          <p>Sherman purchased the <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> leaf, <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>
                        20 and 21, the proof from Thornton’s Virgil, and the <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings from the Weyhe Gallery (New York) in 1938 or 1939;
                        in his copy of Weyhe’s Catalogue #81 (December 1938), preserved at
                        Brown, he wrote “Mine” in the margin next to several entries
                        on pp. 11 and 12, and dated the annotations 4 August 1939. (Sherman may have
                        been mistaken in claiming the entry for <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>—see
                        below.) <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> 13 could have come through Weyhe as well,
                        but it is not listed in this catalogue; because it has been trimmed
                        differently and bound separately, it may have been acquired at another time.
                        According to <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, the Weyhe Gallery probably broke
                        up copy o of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, which once contained at least 17

            <p>The leaf containing two plates from <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (accession
                            number KPR 142) is much more important from a scholarly perspective than

                            restrikes. The <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> leaf was matted for the
                            exhibition at Brown, but it is now loose in the portfolio that also
                            contains the <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings. Its left edge (recto) is
                            irregular where it has been cut from an earlier binding: the leaf now
                            measures 22.3 centimeters across the top, 22.7 across the bottom, and is
                            31.2 centimeters high. It bears various unidentified dealers’ or
                            collectors’ annotations in pencil (recto, top left:
                            “18,” lower left: “Rx,” and “Europe
                            page 6,” bottom margin: “This is the one in the

                            ink at upper right in the recto. The leaf came from what is called copy
                            c of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, which was never an actual copy of the
                            book but the uncoordinated plates from <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> that
                            were once included in a volume of miscellaneous Blakeana assembled by
                            George A. Smith in the midnineteenth century. This collection is
                            described in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> under “The Order in
                            which the Songs of Innocence and Experience ought to be paged”
                            (337-41).</p>
            <p>The leaf from <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> c at Brown is well printed on
                            heavy wove paper, without watermarks, in two different colors of ink: a
                            slightly brownish gray for plate 11 (illus. 1) and a grayish blue for
                            plate 17 (illus. 2), with slight vestiges of black ink appearing along
                            the edges of a few relief areas on both sides. Plate 11 probably would
                            be darker but still gray if printed more heavily, and 17 would be
                            decidedly blue, but not so bright a blue as the ink on plate 17 in copy
                            B (on inks, see Viscomi 95). Both plates are printed squarely, and
                            appear to have been carefully registered to each other in the
                            recto/verso format. The plate border (the relief line around the edges
                            of the plate created by the strips of wax used to hold acid on the plate
                            during etching) has been wiped before printing on plate 17 and on the
                            upper left corner of 11, as Blake often did in printing relief plates
                            before 1795. This must be a 1794 impression because plate 17 is in the
                            first of three states: line 32 reads “She ceas’d, and all
                            went forth to sport,” rather than “She ceas’d, for
                            All were forth at sport,” and line 35 still ends “and the
                            angel trumpet blew”; this phrase was gouged out of the plate in
                            later states. The leaf at Brown must therefore have been printed by
                            Blake, even if he never finished it or assembled into a book the pages
                            known as <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> c.</p>
            <p>The discovery of this leaf solves some old puzzles and raises some new
                            questions. A leaf of a slightly different size but bearing plates 11 and
                            17 on recto and verso that was formerly in the collection of Charles
                            Ryskamp (sold in July 1994 by a Connecticut dealer to Robert N. Essick)
                            has been confused with the one just discovered at Brown. In <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> Bentley traced the Ryskamp/Essick leaf from George
                            A. Smith to Quaritch to Muir to Macgeorge to George C. Smith to Weyhe,
                            after which it disappears until sold by “Allen of New
                            York” in about 1964 to Ryskamp (Bentley 339-41). Sherman’s
                            annotation in the Weyhe catalogue, noted above, and the closer fit of
                            the Brown leaf to the fuller description in the 1938 Parke-Bernet
                            catalogue of the George C. Smith sale (quoted below), led me at first to
                            believe that this entire provenance should be assigned to the leaf at
                            Brown, leaving the Ryskamp/Essick leaf an orphan. But the entry in the
                            Weyhe catalogue that was claimed by Sherman is more likely a description
                            of the Ryskamp/Essick leaf, which is printed in green on both sides,
                            than of the leaf at Brown, which is unmistakably gray and blue: <pb id="p28-96" n="96"/><figure><head>2. <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, plate 17.</head><figDesc>Relief etching. Koopman Collection, John Hay Library, Brown

                                a Prophecy”, almost full page composition of a kneeling woman
                                clasping a patriarch with outstretched arms, superb in design,
                                etched on copper and printed in relief as a woodcut in green ink;
                                and on the reverse page 16 of the same book, “Ethinthus Queen
                                [sic] of Waters”, also printed in green ink, MacGeorge Coll.,
                                exceedingly scarce 125.00 (Weyhe 11). </q></p>
            <p>Thus the Ryskamp/Essick leaf is probably first recorded in this Weyhe
                            entry; the leaf is now closely trimmed, and does not bear an ink page
                            number like those George A. Smith wrote on the items bound with
                            “The Order of the ‘Songs,’” though it might
                            have been part of that collection or the later Macgeorge collection, as
                            claimed in the Weyhe catalogue. The leaf at Brown does have an ink page
                            number, 38, that corresponds to an appropriate place in the collected
                            volume (which place had been tentatively assigned to an untraced
                            impression of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> 15; see Bentley 338). Both the
                            Ryskamp/Essick and the Brown leaves must have come through Weyhe at some
                            point; the Brown leaf was probably purchased from Weyhe in 1939 (Sherman
                            must have recalled from whom he bought it and when, even if he
                            didn’t closely check the ink color in the catalogue entry). The
                            Brown leaf is certainly <pb id="p28-97" n="97"/> the one sold to Weyhe
                            in 1938, as described in the Parke-Bernet catalogue: <q> 32. [Blake].

            <p>These colors are correct for the Brown leaf, as are the dimensions; the
                            Ryskamp/Essick leaf is much smaller: 25.6 cm high and 19.3 cm wide.</p>
            <p>The pairing of plates 11 and 17 on these leaves could have been an
                            artifact of experimental proof-printing in which, to save paper, Blake
                            grabbed at random an unused impression of plate 11 and proofed plate 17
                            on the other side to see how the latter looked. Perhaps something like
                            that sequence happened a decade or two later with those plates of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> that have plates from <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> printed on the other side (Bentley 144).<ref target="n52" type="note">1</ref> But the conjunction of plates 11
                            and 17 on recto and verso may be something more than an ordinary
                            consequence of proof-printing on salvaged paper. The pairing may instead
                            be a vestige of an early version of the book that was superseded rather
                            than a mere accident. There are at least three additional 11/17 pairs,
                            none of them in copies of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> that are generally
                            regarded as complete: in copy a, at the British Museum; in copy b, at
                            the Morgan Library; and another leaf from <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> c at
                            the Newberry Library (Bentley 144). The mere existence of five such
                            pairs suggests that they were created deliberately rather than
                                randomly.<ref target="n53" type="note">2</ref> Further, Blake wiped
                            the plate borders before printing the Ryskamp/Essick, Newberry and Brown
                            11/17 leaves (and perhaps the others as well), a procedure that would
                            not have been necessary for most workshop proofs, such as those created
                            to check the progress of a design or to monitor the adjustment of the
                            press. <note id="n52"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Unused impressions of plate 11
                                might be expected to exist, for the extensive white-line engraving
                                (executed with a burin after etching) that delineates the clouds on
                                that plate might have called for regular proofing to check progress.
                                But in fact plate 11 on the Brown leaf is in exactly the same state
                                as all other surviving impressions—so it probably
                                didn’t become scrap paper because Blake was dissatisfied with
                                the design or the text on the copperplate. Further, plate 11 printed
                                at least as well as in pages that were used in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, so it wouldn’t have been rejected for that
                                reason.</note><note id="n53"><hi rend="s">2</hi> It is also possible that Blake and/or
                                his wife became confused in trying to print pages in recto/verso
                                format, the arrangement used in several early copies. Losing
                                one’s place would be easy in the case of a book with no
                                printed page numbers and few catchwords. Viscomi shows in <hi rend="i">Blake and the Idea of the Book</hi> that Blake usually
                                produced illuminated books in small editions, so he and Catherine
                                could have printed plate 17 several times on the back of good
                                impressions of plate 11 when they meant to print plate 12, and then
                                put these leaves aside when they discovered the error. But plate 17
                                is in at least three different colors in these 11/17 pairs, which
                                makes a single printing disaster a little less likely.</note></p>
            <p>Evidence in the text confirms that the leaf at Brown and its 11/17
                            cousins, some of which have been modified extensively in various ways,
                            mark phases in the transition from one version of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, probably a shorter one, to the version that he
                            produced as finished copies in several configurations. Andrew Lincoln
                            noticed in 1978 that copy a, the “incomplete” uncolored
                            copy in the British Museum (with an 11/17 pair), could actually
                            constitute an “early version” of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>
                            that lacked the episode on plates 12-16. It is not hard to envision the
                            material on plate 17 following that on 11, for both consist of roughly
                            parallel invocations of her offspring by Enitharmon. (For those using
                            Erdman’s revised edition or <hi rend="i">The Illuminated
                                Blake</hi>, plates 11 and 17 in Bentley’s pagination
                            correspond with Erdman’s plates 8 and 14.) As Lincoln suggested,
                            the narrative on plates 12-16 must be an interpolation, though it could
                            have been assembled in part from plates that were originally elsewhere
                            in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (see also Larrissy, who describes
                            connections with <hi rend="i">America</hi>). Plates 12-16 encompass an
                            independently coherent description of Enitharmon’s 1800-year
                            sleep, beginning abruptly at the top of plate 12 and ending on plate 16,
                            when she wakes up and returns to her invocations. It is true that
                            Ethinthus, addressed at the beginning of 17, is first mentioned in the
                            last four lines of 16, but as Viscomi notes in correspondence, the 11
                            lines at the end of this plate can be seen as a transitional device to
                            reintroduce the interrupted song of Enitharmon.</p>
            <p>Blake apparently made the textual revisions on plates 17 and 18, the
                            mechanics of which are described by Viscomi (278-79), in order to
                            accommodate the new narrative created by the interpolation. He modified
                            line 17:32 from “She ceas’d, and all went forth to
                            sport,” the original printed text in the 11/17 pairs, to
                            “She ceas’d, for All were forth at sport” in the
                            finished copies because, once plates 12-16 had been added, the party to
                            which Enitharmon was calling her sons and daughters had already been
                            going on without her for 1800 <pb id="p28-98" n="98"/><figure><head>3. Plate XIII, Thornton’s <hi rend="i">Virgil.</hi></head><figDesc>Wood engraving. Koopman Collection, John Hay Library, Brown

                            lines 17:35 and 18:1 in the completed books because this comparatively
                            simple apocalyptic gesture had been replaced by the more complicated
                            episode involving the “red limb’d Angel” and the
                            “mighty Spirit” of Newton on plate 16 (see Lincoln 213 and
                            Bentley 155).</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">Europe</hi> as a whole generated an unusual number of
                            surviving “proof” pages and variant states (Viscomi
                            276-79); each of these may have its own story to tell. Some of these
                            pages appear to have been rejected preliminaries, some transitional
                            states, and others private afterthoughts, as David Erdman regards the
                            variant title pages (397). We certainly have an extraordinary wealth of
                            complex evidence to work with: the other 11/17 pairs, especially those
                            with modifications in ink and by erasure; other variant pages;
                            additional recto/verso pairs of other plates; inferences that can be
                            drawn from the order in which Blake used the backs of the <hi rend="i">America</hi> copperplates to make the <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>
                            copperplates (see Bentley 145 and Viscomi 413n3); offsets on
                            “proofs” and other pages; and more. It is possible that
                            the version of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> in which 17 followed 11 was
                            merely one of several orders with which Blake experimented. Yet because
                            there are five 11/17 pairs, Blake probably had settled on a complete
                                ur-<hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (perhaps corresponding to copy a, as
                            Lincoln suggests) that he regarded as ready to publish, and he began to
                            do so. Then he decided to make radical changes, one consequence of which
                            is the extraordinary number of unused plates from this illuminated book.
                            Scholars attempting to sort out the composition process of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> must carefully consider the potential significance of
                            all the “proof” leaves, especially the recto/verso pairs,
                            but even a study of the further implications of the 11/17 pairs alone
                            will depend on a much more thorough survey of them than I have done.</p>

            <p>All three plates from the posthumous <hi rend="i">Songs o</hi> at Brown
                            are printed in the orange-brown ink that Bentley describes as having
                            been used for <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> 39, copy o, in his collection
                            (Bentley 371). <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> 13 and 20 are underinked, and all
                            three plates were printed with their borders. The poor inking and the
                            unwiped borders are characteristic of posthumous pulls by Frederick
                            Tatham, as is the fact that the platemark dimensions run about two
                            millimeters larger than those of copies printed by Blake, who dampened
                            the paper before printing to improve ink absorption; it shrank as it
                            dried (Bentley 67). <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> 13 and 20 both show portions
                            of a J WHATMAN watermark that do not include a date, though the paper is
                            probably the same as that of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> 39, copy o, which
                            has an 1831 Whatman watermark (Bentley 371).</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">Songs</hi> 13 is by itself in blue boards, together with a
                            loose fragment trimmed from the page; the leaf now measures 16.0 by 23.0
                            centimeters (using width by height as in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>).
                            The fragment measures 18.1 by 2.5 centimeters; the whole leaf <pb id="p28-99" n="99"/> was therefore almost as wide as
                            Bentley’s <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> 39 from this copy of the book,
                            which measures 18.6 centimeters. The fragment, inscribed in pencil
                            “Page from Blake’s Songs of Innocence Chas Eliot Norton/
                            SP 40,” identifies one nineteenth-century owner of the whole
                            book. <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> 20 and 21 are bound together in the same
                            kind of blue boards as those containing <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> 13, but
                            the two leaves have been even more severely trimmed, to 11.8 by 20.0
                            centimeters. They are both inscribed (at the bottom of the leaves, in
                            the same hand as on the scrap from <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> 13),
                            “Blake Songs of Innocence Charles Eliot Norton

            <p>The impression of Blake’s wood engraving XIII from
                            Thornton’s <hi rend="i">Virgil</hi> (illus. 3; accession number
                            KPR 177) is probably what its mount claims it to be, a posthumous
                            impression once owned by Samuel Palmer that was taken by Edward Calvert
                            from the blocks when they were owned by John Linnell. The heavily inked
                            print is on thin paper without a visible watermark, trimmed to the very
                            edge of the image at 7.8 by 3.6 centimeters, mounted on a thick card
                            that is only about a millimeter wider all around, then pasted on heavy
                            wove paper and bound in brown boards. An inscription on the original
                            mount by A. H. Palmer, Samuel’s son, has been copied onto the
                            stiff paper on which the print and card are now mounted: “These
                            identical proofs [there is only one now] of Blake’s
                            Philips’s Pastoral (and this mount) were S. Palmer’s
                            constant companions for many years. The proofs were printed by Edward
                            Calvert, at Brixton, for John Linnell. See No. 28, V and A Museum
                            Exhibition Catalogue p. 27. A. H. P.” One might suspect the
                            younger Palmer of mild puffery here. Samuel Palmer also owned (and gave
                            away) at least one impression from the unmutilated blocks made in his
                            presence by Blake himself (Palmer 2: 707-08), and the particular image
                            on Plate XIII contributed less decisively to the Shoreham style than did
                            the pastoral scenes among Blake’s illustrations in this series.
                            But the gracefully distorted dancers here resemble figures that appear
                            in Palmer’s work and that of the other “Ancients”
                            (see Paley), and this print may well have been important to him.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings (accession numbers KPR 140 and 141)
                            are good “post-proof” impressions on thin India paper laid
                            into unmarked heavy wove paper; they are probably from the final 1874
                            issue of 100 copies ordered by John Linnell (Bentley 524). The wove
                            paper of <hi rend="i">Job</hi> 15 measures 33.0 by 45.9 centimeters
                            (India 16.3 by 20.8); <hi rend="i">Job</hi> 20 is 34.3 by 42.5 (India
                            16.2 by 21.1).</p>
            <p>The copy of <hi rend="i">Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims</hi> (KPR 258) at
                            Brown is sealed in a mat and frame and was not available for close
                            inspection, but it is certainly a fifth state impression on India laid
                            on wove paper, probably a late nineteenth-century Colnaghi restrike (see
                            Essick 85-86). This print is much less heavily inked than the Sessler
                            restrikes of the 1940’s and seems almost gray by comparison;
                            Essick attributes the flatness of Colnaghi restrikes to inadequate
                            cleaning of the plate before printing (85).</p>

            <title>A New Colored Copy of <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> at Smith
                            College</title>
          </head>
          <byline>by <docAuthor>Alexander S. <name>Gourlay</name></docAuthor></byline>
          <p>In late 1992,G. E. Bentley learned that the Neilson Library at Smith College,
                        Northampton, MA, contains a hand-colored copy of the 1797 edition of
                        Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> with engravings by Blake.
                        This copy is not listed in Bentley’s 1977 <hi rend="i">Blake
                            Books</hi> (642-46, 956-57), nor in the census of colored copies in the
                        1980 Clarendon edition of Blake’s illustrations to Young (Grant et
                        al. 1: 62-72). Bentley, who was in England at the time, asked me to take a
                        look at the book so that it could be included in his forthcoming supplement
                        to <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, where it will be designated Copy Z, the
                        twenty-sixth colored copy known. I am grateful to G. E. Bentley for the tip,
                        to John E. Grant for loaning me slides of other colored copies, and to Sarah
                        Black and other members of the staff of the Neilson Library for their
                        assistance.</p>
          <p>The volume at Smith College is a fine example of a “Type I” or
                        “White Death” copy, that is, one of a group of similar copies,
                        most of which are thought to have been colored by someone other than Blake
                        under commercial auspices shortly after the publication of the book.
                        (Perhaps the colorist was John Harris, Sr., a London artist specializing in
                        book-coloring who was long affiliated with the family of the publisher of
                        the 1797 <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>; see Weimerskirch 251n15.)
                        Although there is considerable variation within the group, and some problems
                        have arisen with the classification system devised by the editors of the
                        Clarendon edition, one can still say that the White Death copies are as a
                        class most similar in coloring to Blake’s watercolor drawings on
                        which the engravings were based.</p>
          <p>The title page of the Smith College copy is colored according to the pattern
                        found in other White Death copies; furthermore, the robe of Disease on
                        illustration 6E (page 10) and the faces of the old man and woman on 20E
                        (page 35) contain the darkened, mottled colors that were referred to as
                        “grotesque coloring” in the Clarendon edition (1: 57-59). The
                        presence of these colors, which probably resulted from long-term chemical
                        decomposition of pigments that were intended to produce a much less extreme
                        effect, indicates that the colorist used the same unusual palette as well as
                        the same coloring pattern found in several other White Death copies. The
                        most interesting feature of the Smith College copy is the title page to
                        “Night the Second” (11E, page 17), where the giant figure of
                        Death has been given a black gown and shroud that cover his head and even
                        his left hand. Grant reports in correspondence that this color detail also
                        appears in other White Death copies, including those at Washington
                        University (Copy W) and the University of Texas (Copy C). The pigments
                        throughout the Smith College copy are bright and fresh, some remarkably so,
                        and the coloring scheme is often complex, but no more so than in many other
                        White Death copies; in general the work is very competent and careful but
                        evinces no inspired attention. I couldn’t discern any pencil
                        annotations or variant states of plates in the book.</p>
          <p>According to a tiny stamp inside the front cover, the volume was
                        “Bound by Riviere and Son” in the present full dark blue
                        leather with elaborate gilt tooling on the back and sides; this binding
                        appears to have been part of a general restoration in which all the leaves
                        were cut out of an earlier binding and “guarded,” that is,
                        glued (precariously) in pairs to narrow strips of paper and sewn together in
                        a new binding. This unusual guarding may have been intended to correct the
                        inadequate inner margins usually found throughout these books; several
                        designs disappear into the gutter in most copies. The last leaf of the poem
                        (43E, pages 95-96) has been trimmed by an extra inch at the bottom, probably

          <p>In one sense Morris Eaves’s book fills in the context of earlier art
                        histories for Blake’s narrative of art history in his <hi rend="i">Public Address</hi> and <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue.</hi> This
                        is to focus on chapters 3 and 4. But in a larger sense the context <hi rend="i">is</hi> the book. This is a fascinating study in
                        historiography—a narrative of “narratives,”
                        “histories,” and “stories” of the English School
                        of painting and engraving, with heroes and villains in its artists and
                        patrons. Eaves shows the interdependence of the narratives of art and of
                        British commerce and religion. He studies the alternative narrative,s their
                        variants and common structures, categorizing them as progressive based on
                        improvement of technical and aesthetic education (the Vasari canon, the
                        Carracci eclecticism, the de Piles <hi rend="i">balance de la
                        peinture</hi>), cyclic and regressive based on recovery and return, and
                        static based on native ability (due possibly to the English climate).
                        Narrative is a more flexible term than discourse, more various than
                        deterministic, suggesting more of Propp than Foucault. It permits Eaves to
                        separate truth from myth, showing how a myth reflected in the interested
                        party who invented and promulgated it, and often how narrative—also
                        another word for theory—fitted with practice.</p>
          <p>It is a relief to read that “the fit between the simplicities of
                        official theory and the complexities of practice had become ill indeed; the
                        margins were threatening to outgrow the text.” Eaves’s book
                        covers most of the same ground as Barrell’s <hi rend="i">Political
                            Theory of Painting</hi> but offers a much broader, less claustrophobic
                        perspective. Barrell’s book explored one master discourse (or theory)
                        which projected one narrative, the one sanctified by Reynolds in which
                        English art grows from the imitation of continental art (but in practice
                        essentially the collecting of it), reaches its peak in the patronage of
                        Charles I, declines in the iconoclasm of his Puritan opponents, and except
                        for the momentary flowering of Wren and Thornhill’s St. Paul’s
                        (in Prince Hoare’s narrative), only recovers when Reynolds reunites
                        the English School once again with the continental and founds an academy on
                        the French model.</p>
          <p>The great printseller John Boydell is the central figure of Eaves’s
                        own narrative. He is the symbolic middleman, initiator of the Shakespeare
                        Gallery project which fulfilled the earlier narratives of blocking and
                        opportunity, bringing together painter and engraver with the great English
                        literary subject, Shakespeare. Boydell’s personal myth of the
                        shopkeeper Maecenas (in its most elaborate form laid out by John Pye II) is
                        shown being created, developed, discredited, and utilized by artists from
                        James Barry to Prince Hoare and John Landseer. Eaves focuses on the
                        historiographical moment when Boydell, the art of reproductive engraving,
                        and the international dissemination of English prints triumphantly merged,
                        just before the French Revolution changed all the rules. Eaves—who
                        ends with an exceptionally lucid chapter on the technical problems of
                        engraving in the period—demonstrats the centrality of the history of
                        engraving in the Boydell era, when engraving was “coupled with the
                        commercial success of English painting”; it served the Reynolds ethos
                        of academic copying and expanded the audience of art (in theory at least)
                        beyond imagining, while at the same time—as Landseer and Blake were
                        to show—its distinctions between original and copy undermined the
                        role of the artist.</p>
          <p>The counter-narrative, suppressed but implicit in Boydell’s project,
                        surfaces in Hazlitt (the villain of Barrell’s academic narrative)
                        and, above all, in Allan Cunningham, whose <hi rend="i">Lives of the most
                            Eminent British Painters</hi> (1829-33) has been unfairly shunted aside
                        by art historians as a mere popularization. Indeed, their writings are a
                        culmination of that large body of relatively journalistic (as opposed to
                        “philosophical”) material that from the 1730s onward had
                        projected an opposing tradition. In Cunningham’s story of the
                        Reformation, far from a disaster, begins the process of liberating English
                        artists from foreign influence and domination (Roman Catholicism, and
                        Holbein, Rubens, and Van Dyck), making way for a Protestant and therefore
                        English artist, Hogarth. This was, of course, Hogarth’s own
                        narrative, pointing the way to the primitivistic Signpainters’
                        Exhibition, which consisted of examples of that form of aboriginal English
                        painting; but more than Cunningham seems aware he developed and
                        demonstrated, in his engraved works, the principles of Protestant iconoclasm
                        itself. Cunningham picked up through the Hogarth narrative, at its most
                        agitated in the academy dispute of the 1750s, when Hogarth opposed the
                        primary principle of Reynolds and his followers who argued for “the
                        continuity of English with continental art.”</p>
          <pb id="p28-102" n="102"/>
          <p>Cunningham’s words on Hogarth show how antithetical this narrative is
                        to the academic: (1) Hogarth was antiacademic and original: “That his
                        works are <hi rend="i">unlike those of other men</hi>, is his merit, not his
                        fault. He belonged to <hi rend="i">no school of art</hi>; he was the produce
                        of <hi rend="i">no academy</hi>; no man living or dead had any share in
                        forming his mind, or in rendering his hand skilful.” (2) And he was
                        native English: “He was the spontaneous offspring of <hi rend="i">the
                            graphic spirit of his country</hi>, as native to the heart of England as
                            <hi rend="i">independence</hi> is, and he may be fairly called, in <hi rend="i">his own way</hi>, the <hi rend="i">first-born</hi> of her
                        spirit” (emphasis added). Although the perennial “in his own
                        way” is retained, to delimit his genius, Hogarth is given the
                        temporal priority reserved in the academic discourse for Reynolds. It is, of
                        course, another myth, as prejudiced as the Reynolds-Royal Academy one, but
                        it is good to see Cunningham, if not Hogarth himself, replaced in the
                        history from which theorists from Reynolds to Barrell have elided him.</p>
          <p>Boydell was near enough in time to recognize this, and his Shakespeare
                        Gallery was signalized—as was his term as lord mayor—by the
                        purchase of the copperplates and publication of the folios of
                        Hogarth’s engraved works. For Hogarth was <hi rend="i">his</hi>
                        model, as the first English painter to show how painting can be
                        commercialized, how the international market can be broached, how more and
                        less expensive versions of a print can be produced, and how to exploit all
                        the intricacies of subscription and every other kind of publication Boydell
                        later developed. Hogarth even anticipated aspects of the business of
                        popularizing “high art” missed by Boydell but exploited by
                        Wedgewood, such as the talent for “commercializing history” by
                        utilizing events, heroes, and villains. Though he did not fit into
                        Barry’s academic discourse, he also prefigured Barry’s Society
                        of Arts paintings with his St. Bartholomew’s Hospital paintings.</p>
          <p>After the marshalling of these conflicting narratives, in chapter 3 Eaves
                        turns to the other “original,” William Blake. The main point
                        is clear enough—that Blake traced the history of engraving all the
                        way back to Egypt and Moses and wrote a history in which the Bible and the
                        technology of engraving intersect in interesting ways that are now, in the
                        light of the various more conventional narratives we have seen, much more
                        easily understood. It is less easy to turn from exposition of the discursive
                        prose of Hazlitt and Cunningham to the density of Blakean myth and poetry to
                        its exegesis. We lose (at least in chapter 3, if not 4) the broad
                        perspective we enjoyed with the other narratives. We are reading <hi rend="i">inside</hi> this narrative and our author <figure/> is a
                        Blakean who takes us from rational analysis to special pleading; from public
                        argument, in a shared discourse, to personal imagery based on these
                        arguments <hi rend="i">and</hi> a private system, which carries over into
                        the “discursive” <hi rend="i">Public Address</hi> and <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue.</hi> Characteristically, Blake
                        introduces a Christian narrative: his vocabulary (Florentine vs. Venetian,
                        original-imitation, artcounter-arts, Christian-Neoclassical, artist-priest,
                        white-black, Jesus-Moses) is all based on the old New Testament-Old
                        Testament contrast of spirit and law. As Eaves puts it plainly,
                        Blake’s argument “soars high above the average level of the
                        most acute critiques of English-school discourse” (183).</p>
          <p>With a few exceptions in the Blake chapters, Eaves’s book treats his
                        subject with brilliant commonsense, and it will be a pity if his book does
                        not enjoy the same level of critical attention accorded recent
                        art-historical studies of the period which have offered formulas, easily
                        expanded by eager graduate students, into which such complex pictures as
                        Eaves’s will not easily fit. Eaves’s study, in all its gaudy
                        variety, is of greater utility and imagination, as well as enjoyment in the
                        reading.</p>
          <p>Typographically the book offers further pleasures. The illustrations are
                        generous and well-placed. The text which accompanies them sometimes runs on
                        for pages at a time parallel with the regular text. The effect is somewhere
                        between Derrida’s <hi rend="i">Glas</hi> and a <hi rend="i">Time-Life</hi> art book. The lessons, both theoretical and practical,
                        in the history of print technology and engraving techniques are alone worth
                        the price of admission.</p>

          <p>Does anybody actually <hi rend="i">need</hi> a full-blown catalogue of this
                        particular sort of material, illustrated with no less than 295 high-quality
                        reproductions? Or is its publication just another ritual move in the process
                        of Blake’s canonization as a hero of late eighteenth-century British
                        culture? In order to understand Blake’s “original”
                        works, his poetry and his creative art, does one have to care, really, about
                        “copy” engravings such as his frontispieces after Saverio
                        Dalla Rosa’s drawings of the statues of Catullus and his friend,
                        Cornelius Nepos (#XXX, 66)? With the author of the book under review, I
                        should like to argue that the answer to these and similar questions
                        concerning the scholarly legitimation of the production of this catalogue
                        very definitely has to be in the affirmative. Due to some classicist notions
                        that still define what is to be considered an “original” work
                        of art, and what is “merely” a
                        “reproduction”—ideological norms and concepts that as
                        yet await deconstruction—Blake’s work as a commercial engraver
                        remains the least known aspect of his output. This alone would justify the
                        publication of Robert N. Essick’s latest book. In addition there are
                        some other very good reasons for supplanting the earlier bibliographical
                        checklists of Blake’s commercial engravings with a complete
                        chalcographical catalogue raisonné of the book illustrations, reasons
                        I hope to suggest in what follows.<ref target="n54" type="note">1</ref><note id="n54"><hi rend="s">1</hi> For a list of earlier catalogues of

          <p>At the very beginning of his introduction Robert Essick reminds his readers
                        that the <q> modern aesthetic, one that Blake helped to initiate, emphasizes
                            original print-making and devalues reproductive prints. Consequently,
                            Blake’s translations on to copperplates of images first executed
                            in other media by other artists are given short shrift and their
                            multifaceted importance to his life is overlooked. It would be foolish
                            to claim for these copy plates artistic equivalence with <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> or the illustrations to The Book of Job,
                            but an understanding of the economic and graphic matrix in which Blake
                            created these visual and verbal masterpieces requires some attention to
                            the lesser productions of his etching needle and graver. (1) </q></p>
          <p>This much one may learn simply by looking at the dates inscribed on the
                        prints catalogued in the present publication, and by comparing them with the
                        chronology of Blake’s dated paintings and the printings of his own
                        illuminated books. Evidently a considerable amount of the work which went
                        into the production of Blake’s poetry and of what is today considered
                        his “original” drawings, paintings, and engravings was
                        financed—and thus made possible—only by Blake’s
                        commissions for commercial “reproductive” engravings after
                        designs by other artists.<ref target="n55" type="note">2</ref><note id="n55"><hi rend="s">2</hi> In his introductory study, Essick
                            comments on the “crucial financial support for Blake’s
                            first efforts in relief etching” (7) that may have been provided
                            by the fee the engraver had received for the large plate after Hogarth
                            (#XX), first published in 1788.</note></p>
          <p>Both the “original” works and the “reproductive”
                        engravings were often executed with the same tools and at the same working
                        table. This much granted, it is more than reasonable to assume that there
                        are also technical, formal, and iconographical characteristics shared by the
                        products of both of these realms of the poet-artist’s activities. For
                        the very first time, Essick’s catalogue allows for a systematic
                        investigation of such cross-currents. Also, it seems more than likely that,
                        much as Blake’s imagery would have absorbed a considerable number of
                        motifs from his commercial engravings after the designs of others (and the
                        entries in the catalogue under review are full of suggestive comparisons
                        between the book illustrations and Blake’s other works), so his ideas
                        about the generic functioning of printed images would have been shaped in
                        part by his work as a reproductive engraver. For example, the peculiarities
                        in the production and “marketing” of Blake’s
                        illuminated books are, I think, best understood if seen in connection with
                        that of the engraved galleries of pictures rather than that of late
                        eighteenth-century books of poetry.<ref target="n56" type="note">3</ref><note id="n56"><hi rend="s">3</hi> Similar observations and closely related
                            matters are also discussed in detail in Joseph Viscomi’s <hi rend="i">Blake and the Idea of the Book</hi> (Princeton, NJ:

          <p>In 1987-88, the Huntington Library and Art Gallery presented an exhibition
                        devoted to <hi rend="i">William Blake and His Contemporaries and
                            Followers.</hi> The works on show had been selected “from the
                        Collection of Robert N. Essick,” arguably the finest and, in any
                        case, for the scholar the most interesting collection of Blake’s
                        works currently in private hands. In the introduction to the exhibition
                        catalogue, the collector and author of <hi rend="i">Blake’s
                            Commercial Book Illustrations</hi> (hereafter abbreviated as <hi rend="i">CBI</hi>) gave a brief account of “the shape of [his]
                        Blake collection and the principles by which it was assembled.” While
                        still “a graduate student of English literature in the late
                        sixties,” Essick set for himself “the modest goal of acquiring
                        the standard texts and works of criticism on William Blake’s poetry
                        and art as a reference library to assist [his] own early attempts at
                        becoming a scholar.” He unquestionably succeeded, and any subscriber
                        to <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> is certainly well aware of his prolific output of
                        books and articles devoted to the study of Blake and his contemporaries.</p>
          <p>As a collector Essick was soon to find that “no one bitten by the
                        bibliomania bug can limit himself to merely practical needs.” Because
                        availability and cost “are important in any collecting,” he
                        decided “in the early seventies, to acquire books containing
                        Blake’s commercial illustrations—the one area of his
                        activities as an artist and craftsman not already well mined by dealers and
                        collectors. Thus, almost by default,” the author of <hi rend="i">CBI</hi> has been able to bring together (and only <hi rend="i">inter
                            alia</hi>, to be sure) what now probably is “the largest
                        collection of editions containing Blake’s engravings (the British
                        Library is second).”<ref target="n57" type="note">4</ref> At the same
                        time, and starting with his groundbreaking study of the iconography of
                        graphic styles in “Blake and the Traditions of Reproductive
                            Engraving,”<ref target="n58" type="note">5</ref> the
                        scholar-collector began to demonstrate the “research interest”
                        of the materials he collected. Following the example of the late Sir
                        Geoffrey Keynes, Essick developed “the habit of combining scholarship
                        and collecting,”<ref target="n59" type="note">6</ref> a habit from
                        which all readers of his book on Blake’s printmaking processes, of
                        his catalogue raisonné of Blake’s separate plates, and now of

          <p>This study of Blake’s commercial engravings begins with
                        Essick’s account of the relationship between the new catalogue and
                        some earlier surveys of some of the same material, especially the extant two
                        of the three volumes planned as a bibliographical and chalcographical
                        account of <hi rend="i">William Blake: Book Illustrator.</hi> These he
                        himself coauthored with Roger R. Easson, and the two volumes were published
                        in 1972 and 1979. “The present catalogue is not a revision of Easson
                        and Essick, but it is intended to replace the print catalogue and
                        reproductions in the second volume and treat most of the materials intended
                        for the absent third” (v). The preface then outlines the purpose of
                            <hi rend="i">CBI</hi>: <q> I have taken as my first responsibility the
                            recording of facts about Blake’s reproductive book
                            illustrations—their sizes, inscriptions, progressive states,
                            locations of preliminary drawings, and the quotation or summary of all
                            documents relating to their production. I have supplemented this basic
                            information with discussions of graphic techniques and styles,
                            Blake’s revisions of preliminary designs, his borrowings of
                            motifs for his own compositions, the relationships of illustrations with
                            their texts, and the role major commissions played in Blake’s
                            life and the shaping of his ideas. (v) </q></p>
          <p>The second part of the book’s preface details “a few
                        guidelines” (vi) to the use of the catalogue entries. It establishes
                        the meaning of certain technical terms in Essick’s text, introduces
                        the conventions employed in the measurements of prints, the recording of
                        signatures, titles, and imprints, and explains the author’s use of
                        cross-references and the coverage of the index.</p>
          <p>Like the catalogue entries themselves, Essick’s introductory study of
                        “Blake’s Reproductive Book Illustrations” is organized
                        chronologically, following Blake’s career as a professional
                        reproductive engraver from the years of his apprenticeship to Basire up to
                        his late book illustrations after Flaxman. This arrangement not only offers
                        a chance to view the plates Blake executed for the book publishers in
                        historical perspective, it also leaves enough room for the author’s
                        interpolation of a systematic discussion of some key issues connected <pb id="p28-105" n="105"/> with the artist’s commercial engravings.
                        Thus, it allows Essick to define clearly what he thinks is the
                        “multifaceted importance” of Blake’s work as a
                        reproductive engraver and to describe “the multiple interactions
                        between art and commerce, graphic execution and literary conception, that
                        shaped Blake’s life and works” (1, 15).</p>
          <p>As a synopsis, or as the <hi rend="i">summa</hi>, of many of his earlier
                        studies of Blake’s printmaking processes, Essick’s
                        introduction by necessity returns to some of the subjects he has previously
                        treated in his publications. However, the new vantage-point supplied by the
                        book illustrations results in a considerable shift of focus. Essick provides
                        an account of the “characteristics of Basire’s shop practices
                        [which] influenced Blake’s later career and aesthetic
                        concepts” (2; see also 6), and he explains “the basic systems
                        for the production of intaglio copperplate book illustrations in the late
                        eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries” (2), stressing the
                        decisive role played by the publisher in these systems (see 2-3). He then
                        briefly glances at the more important of the techniques that were employed
                        in the engraver’s workshop, and next turns to the economics of the
                        trade in general and, in particular, to the fees paid to the copy engravers
                        (see 3-4). One learns of the division of labor between the engraver of the
                        pictorial image, the professional writing engraver and the copperplate
                        printer (see 4-5). The function of working proofs and of published proofs in
                        prepublication states is explained, as is the reason for the succession of
                        the various published states of a copperplate engraving (see 3 and 5).</p>
          <p>At this point, a less restricted discussion of some of the problems of
                        attribution that are involved might have been in place. In discriminating
                        between a first and a second state of any of Blake’s separate plates
                        one takes it for granted—usually without a moment’s
                        hesitation—that it was no one other than the <hi rend="i">peintre-graveur</hi> himself who was responsible for the
                        “purposeful changes . . . on the copperplate” (5n7) which
                        transformed the earlier into the later state. In this respect, there is no
                        difference whatsoever between the chalcographical examination of the three
                        states of “The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder” (1793-c.
                        1810 or later), of the five states of “Chaucers Canterbury
                        Pilgrims” (1810-c. 1823 or later),<ref target="n61" type="note">8</ref> or of the dramatic changes between the first and the eighth
                        state of Rembrandt’s “Christ Presented to the People”
                        (dated 1655 in its seventh state).<ref target="n62" type="note">9</ref> But
                        with an engraving that serves as a book illustration, and with the plate
                        usually owned by the publisher, not the engraver (see 4), the situation is
                        slightly different. Can the original engraver be identified with the
                        engraver who reworks a plate for use in a later edition? Or does one have to
                        speculate that at least occasionally a publisher would employ someone else
                        to restore a set of worn copperplates? <note id="n61"><hi rend="s">8</hi>
                            See Essick 1983 (n. 7) 30-37 (#VIII) and 61-89 (#XVI).</note><note id="n62"><hi rend="s">9</hi> For a descriptive analysis of this
                            etching (B. 76) and its states see, e.g., Christopher White, <hi rend="i">Rembrandt as an Etcher: A Study of the Artist at Work</hi>
                            (London: A. Zwemmer, 1969) i: 87-92.</note></p>
          <p>Essick tells his readers this much: “It seems to have been common
                        practice to hire the original engraver to rework plates whenever possible,
                        but this of course would become increasingly less likely as the time since
                        first execution lengthened” (5). He thus hints at the possibility
                        that some of the later states of Blake’s commercial book
                        illustrations which are recorded in his catalogue may in fact have to be
                        attributed to anonymous journeyman engravers, yet he does not enlarge on the
                        subject. If, however, one thinks of the 1811 and 1818 editions of
                        Richardson’s <hi rend="i">Sir Charles Grandison</hi>, published by C.
                        Cooke and T. Kelly respectively and illustrated with impressions from the
                        plates Blake had engraved for <hi rend="i">The Novelist’s
                            Magazine</hi> (#XI[6-8], 32-33), one might feel tempted to suspect that
                        the engravings Blake did for Harrison &amp; Co. in 1783 have been
                        “substantially reworked” (32) for their third and fourth
                        states by some other engraver(s). The reworked states recorded for
                        Blake’s plates in later issues of Wedgwood’s catalogue of
                        earthenware and porcelain (#L) present another, even more obvious case in
                        point. At the same time, Blake may himself have been employed occasionally
                        to rework plates that had originally been engraved by one of his colleagues,
                        and he may thus have added to his income. Here then is a field that might
                        offer some interesting research opportunities, though since it has not been
                        singled out as particularly promising by Essick, the evidence available from
                        publishers’ account books and other period documents may well be all
                        too scanty to allow for convincing results.</p>
          <p>While the variety of stylistic modes of representation available to the
                        artist-artisan are of course well-characterized in the introduction, Essick
                        also underscores the fact that “reproductive engraving was dependent
                        upon a rigorous division of labour and the subordination of individual
                        expression to uniformity and repeatability” (5). This phenomenon and
                        its effects are described by reference to Blake’s early commissions
                        and his “graphic involvement <pb id="p28-106" n="106"/> with
                        Stothard” (6) and with the William Walker circle of engravers working
                        after Stothard’s designs in the 1780s and 1790s. The problems
                        encountered when attempting to distinguish the graphic vocabulary and syntax
                        used by James Heath in one of his plates after Stothard from that employed
                        by Blake in a reproduction of another of the same artist’s designs
                        signify “the inevitable interweaving of economic exigencies and
                        aesthetic norms that shaped eighteenth-century reproductive graphics”
                        (6). At the same time, such pertinent observations help the reader to
                        understand why the attribution of an unsigned book illustration to Blake (or
                        any other of his colleagues) can seldom be based entirely on stylistic
                            considerations.<ref target="n63" type="note">10</ref><note id="n63"><hi rend="s">10</hi> See Essick’s discussion of this
                            matter in the book’s two appendices (especially 115-17 [#C] and
                            121).</note></p>
          <p>The introductory study to the catalogue also pays considerable attention to
                        the examination of some representative working relations between Blake and
                        one of his publishers, with an author of some of the texts he engraved for,
                        and with two of his fellow artists whose designs he translated onto
                        copperplates. In fairly detailed discussions, one learns of Blake’s
                        business relationships with Joseph Johnson and with Henry Fuseli as one of
                        Johnson’s favorite illustrators (see 7-9),<ref target="n64" type="note">11</ref> with William Hayley (see 9-11), and with John
                        Flaxman (see 11-12). Essick’s keen and experienced eyes enable him to
                        observe how, in Blake’s plates for Wollstonecraft’s <hi rend="i">Original Stories</hi>, the “graphic syntax . . . begins
                        to emerge above the threshold of the visual apprehension and become
                        self-referential. As we view such images, we are given both the illusion of
                        three-dimensional objects in space and an awareness of the medium in which
                        that illusion is created.” This in turn allows for a demonstration of
                        “how experiments in original graphics influenced reproductive
                        styles” (8)—and <hi rend="i">vice versa.</hi> The introduction
                        offers many similarly stimulating comments, for example on “the
                        conceptual implications of stippled lines” (12) as used in
                        Blake’s engravings after Flaxman’s Hesiod compositions, before
                        Essick summarizes the influence of Blake’s career as a copy engraver
                        on the formation of those of the artist’s ideas that were given
                        expression in his “more private and more important endeavours”
                        (13). <note id="n64"><hi rend="s">11</hi> Following a suggestion first made
                            by the late Ruthven Todd, Essick had previously discussed the case of
                            Blake’s engravings after Fuseli—and what there appears to
                            be “an unusual amount of responsibility for the completion of the
                            design, not merely its translation to copper” (7)—in
                            Essick 1980 (n. 7) 51-52. While I am still not entirely convinced of
                            this hypothesis (especially because Fuseli is known to have been hard
                            for any other reproductive engraver to satisfy), I wish to stress that
                                <hi rend="i">CBI</hi> is characterized by an exemplary scholarly
                            open-mindedness that invites, rather than suffocates, such differences
                            of opinion. Essick himself points out alternatives to his preferred
                            reading of the evidence, and in a proviso he alerts his readers to the
                            possibility that here as elsewhere Blake may have “worked from a
                            far more detailed preliminary drawing, of the type conventionally
                            supplied by an artist to a copy engraver” (#XVIII,
                        41).</note></p>
          <p>At the end of his introductory study Essick turns to the research
                        opportunities offered by the material described in his catalogue. Discussing
                        “the conventions of text-design relationships” of
                        Blake’s times, and drawing on examples from Blake’s engravings
                        after Stothard, Fuseli, and his own inventions, Essick finds that ultimately
                        what Blake learned “from his contemporaries about illustrative
                        strategies by engraving their work, and the way in which he both
                        incorporates and diverges from their practices, are more important than his
                        occasional borrowings of specific motifs from their designs”
                            (15).<ref target="n65" type="note">12</ref> While he describes many of
                        these “occasional borrowings” in the catalogue entries, Essick
                        ends this study with a brief discussion of the possibility that “the
                        texts for which Blake engraved plates [might] have been read by him and
                        [thus might have] influenced his ideas” (15). <note id="n65"><hi rend="s">12</hi> For a more detailed discussion of these questions
                            see Essick’s recent study of “Visual/Verbal Relationships

          <p>Seen as a whole, the introduction successfully documents the
                        “multifaceted” interdependence of “original” art
                        and “reproductive” engraving in Blake’s career; and, at
                        the very same time, it effectively clears away the ignorance of those who
                        still do not want to see to what an extent the profession of the commercial
                        reproductive engraver actually “established Blake’s social
                        position for the majority of his contemporaries, placing him in the class of
                        urban artisans” (1), a social affiliation that is of major importance
                        for a proper understanding of Blake’s peculiar stance in a variety of
                        discourse-systems of his times. With the author, one hopes that in the
                        interpretation of Blake’s works, such insights regarding the manifold
                        impact Blake’s “low” art had on the “grand
                        style” of his “high” art productions will now be more
                        generally put into action. <hi rend="i">CBI</hi> supplies all the
                        information necessary in order to do so.</p>
          <p>In the catalogue itself (19-114), each entry begins with a short-title
                        reference to the book in which Blake’s commercial engravings can be
                        found and, wherever that is called for, to its various printings and
                        editions. A typical entry reports in an introductory <pb id="p28-107" n="107"/> note the total number of illustrations included in the
                        respective book, Blake’s own contributions and, if necessary, the
                        history of their attribution to the poet-artist (see, e.g., #XXIII), and the
                        designer(s) of the plates engraved by Blake; in addition, it supplies
                        information regarding preliminary sketches and preparatory drawings for the
                        engravings whenever the current whereabouts of these are known, working
                        proofs and proofs before (some or all) letters, documents relating to the
                        commission, the author of the text, its publisher(s), and reviews that make
                        mention of the plates discussed.<ref target="n66" type="note">13</ref> This
                        is followed by the catalogue proper of the book’s prints with
                        documentation of the measurements, all the inscriptions, the sequence of the
                        published states, and then a generally short annotation commenting on
                        iconography, related drawings, and the possible significance of motifs that
                        Blake may have borrowed for his “original” inventions. A list
                        of the earlier secondary literature on Blake’s engravings in the book
                        catalogued marks the end of each main entry. <note id="n66"><hi rend="s">13</hi> Where appropriate, and arguing from the perspective offered
                            by only one of the books illustrated, Essick has inserted in the entries
                            a few remarks that also apply to more general issues. E.g., his effort
                            to prevent readers from over-interpreting the “differences
                            between Blake’s plates and their prototypes” is strongly
                            in evidence if the next sentence emphasizes that some of “the
                            plates by other engravers show an equal range of variation from their
                            sources” (62).</note></p>
          <p>In order to check the accuracy of Essick’s measurements, of his
                        transcriptions of signatures, titles, and imprints, and of the descriptive
                        commentaries on the images themselves, I reexamined impressions from 165 of
                        the 271 engraved plates that are detailed under the 53 main entries in the
                        catalogue. Though I was trying hard to find some substantial errors in
                        Essick’s descriptions of the prints, the results of the endeavor
                        cannot be summarized in any other way than by stating that this catalogue
                        raisonné deserves the highest possible praise for its reliability.
                        Essick’s descriptive prose is precise—for example, he
                        discriminates between a “proof before letters” and a
                        “proof before signatures” (#XVI, 38)—unimpassioned, and
                        admirably economical. Though there is always some general reference to the
                        graphic mode employed by the artist-artisan in a given engraving (such as
                        “outline” or “stipple”), Essick describes the
                        particulars of the hatching patterns, of burnishing and the like only where
                        there is the need to distinguish a second or third state from the first
                        published version that is illustrated. This need, however, exists in many
                        more cases than may have been expected, largely because the author has
                        discovered numerous previously unrecorded states of Blake’s plates.
                        For example, even where in 1979 Easson and Essick had already recorded no
                        less than three states for Blake’s large plate after Hogarth’s
                        “Beggar’s Opera” painting, the 1991 publication more
                        than doubles this with a list of no fewer than seven states (see #XX, 43);
                        and where one may have expected two states at most for the two 1803
                        printings of Hayley’s <hi rend="i">The Life, and Posthumous Writings,
                            of William Cowper</hi>, Essick confronts his readers with no less than
                        four published states of Blake’s “Weather-House”
                        engraving (#XLIV[4], 88-89).</p>
          <p>In 1979 Easson and Essick still included some of the plates in
                        Bryant’s <hi rend="i">New System</hi>, in Ayloffe’s <hi rend="i">Ancient Monuments</hi>, and in Gough’s <hi rend="i">Sepulchral Monuments</hi> in the main sequence of their catalogue of
                        the commercial book illustrations attributed to Blake as the engraver. In
                        the present publication Essick has decided in favor of a more cautious
                        approach to “Blake’s Apprentice Engravings.” Lacking a
                        “solid basis for attribution” (117), these plates have now
                        been relegated in their entirety to the first of Essick’s appendices
                        (see 115-20). This may not be pleasing, and yet it will be hard to
                        contradict the author’s statement that “for published
                        engravings, we can hardly expect the work of an apprentice to diverge in any
                        clear way from the house style taught by his master” (115).<ref target="n67" type="note">14</ref> In a second appendix (see 121-27)
                        Essick presents a list of 37 “False and Conjectural
                        Attributions.” Whereas some of the plates that during the 1770s came
                        from the workshop of James Basire may or may not have been engraved by Blake
                        under the supervision of his master, most of the engravings referred to in
                        Appendix ii were clearly executed by someone other than the poet-artist. A
                        few of these more than “doubtful” ascriptions date back to the
                        nineteenth century, but Essick’s list ought to prevent dealers and
                        curators from perpetuating them “innocently” (121) in the
                        future. <note id="n67"><hi rend="s">14</hi> The case of Blake’s
                            apprentice engravings is, in this respect, similar to the problems of
                            attribution presented by many eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                            “academies,” drawings from the antique or from life that
                            were executed at the Royal Academy Schools. The attribution of such
                            academical studies to William Blake, his brother, or any other pupil at
                            the Academy Schools should, I think, be treated with the same exemplary
                            reservation that Essick suggests for the attribution of engravings from
                            the Basire workshop to Blake or any of his fellow
                        apprentices.</note></p>
          <p>Though mostly consisting of proper names, the index (see 129-38) seems to be
                        perfectly sufficient for all reference purposes. It is particularly welcome
                        (and entirely in keeping with the author’s <pb id="p28-108" n="108"/>
                        approach to his material) that besides the names of the artists and authors
                        among Blake’s contemporaries, and those of the “owners, past
                        and present, of drawings and pre-publication proofs” (vi), the index
                        includes the names of the publishers of the books illustrated. It thus
                        allows readers to search the catalogue for references to Blake’s
                        business connections with, say, the firm of Harrison &amp; Co. There are
                        few misprints in this book, and scarcely any of them merit ceremonious
                        correction; those I have spotted (such as the typos in the transcription of
                        a German title on page 50) in no way impair the intelligibility of the text
                        (see the appendix, below).</p>
          <p>The author and his publisher are also to be congratulated on the near-300
                        reproductions which illustrate all the engravings discussed as well as some
                        of the preliminary drawings from which Blake worked. Not only do these
                        “Figures” make it easy to use the book as a visual
                        encyclopaedia of Blake’s commercial book illustrations—and to
                        follow some of the lines for future investigations that are suggested by
                        Essick’s catalogue and study—; they are also of the highest
                        possible quality and as such successfully “replace” (v) the
                        sadly inadequate reproductions in volume 2 of <hi rend="i">William Blake:
                            Book Illustrator.</hi> To give an idea just how good the reproductions
                        are, it seems sufficient to refer to the author’s own caveat
                        concerning a “very small signature” which he thought would
                        “probably not [be] visible in the reproduction” (#XIX[1], 42).
                        Turning to figure 61, one finds that it actually is visible, regardless of
                        Essick’s concern.</p>
          <p>No doubt, as a work of reference this catalogue raisonné will
                        unquestionably (and for a long time to come) function as the definite and
                        standard source of information on Blake’s reproductive book
                        engravings. If this is high praise, it still is not enough for the book
                        under review. Though definitive in the material descriptions of
                        Blake’s copy engravings, Essick has succeeded not in closing down his
                        subject, but in efficiently opening up a new field of investigation. While
                        answering almost any question of interest to the collector, <hi rend="i">CBI</hi> also intriguingly challenges Blake scholarship with a new set
                        of questions that deserve to be examined in greater detail. For all these
                        reasons, the acquisition of this volume can only be highly recommended.
                        Serious students as well as all collectors of Blake’s works will want
                        to have a copy ready at hand, if not on their own shelves then at least on
                        those of their preferred research library.</p>
          <p>In trying to think of any negative aspect of the publication of <hi rend="i">CBI</hi>, only one thing comes to mind. Besides the collectors and
                        scholars that are interested in a fuller understanding of Blake’s
                        work, there are also the dealers and auctioneers whose interest in Blake is
                        likely to be informed primarily by economic considerations. With its easily
                        accessible information on all the various states of Blake’s
                        reproductive engravings and with its references to particularly scarce
                        printings of some of these plates, Essick’s catalogue will probably
                        cause a further increase in the prices asked for the books illustrated with
                        the artist-poet’s commercial engravings. Yet this is in the nature of
                        the production of any catalogue raisonné and none of the
                        author’s fault. Therefore, even its possibly disastrous effect on the
                        market for Blake’s lesser productions as a graphic artist can in no
                        way detract from the gratitude we owe the author for sharing his intimate
                        knowledge of the subject. In any case, there can be little doubt about the
                        justice of Essick’s own claim that the material presented in <hi rend="i">CBI</hi>, “along with the introductory survey of
                        Blake’s career as a commercial book engraver and research
                        opportunities in the field, gives this volume a larger interpretive and
                        critical dimension than that offered by most print catalogues”
                        (v-vi).</p>

            <p>pp. 4 and 137: for “William Sharpe” read “William
                            Sharp”; the spelling of the engraver’s name is not the
                            same as that of the publisher, John Sharpe.</p>
            <p>p. 13n28: for “Joachim Moller” read “Joachim

                            translated as “Moeller”).</p>
            <p>p. 14n29: I entirely agree with Essick’s rebuke to
                            Hodnett’s criticisms concerning Fuseli’s illustrations for
                            Chalmers’s 1805 edition of <hi rend="i">The Plays of
                                Shakspeare</hi>; however, readers who are interested in
                            Hodnett’s arguments will want to examine “The Fuseli
                            Shakespeare (1805),” a chapter in Edward Hodnett, <hi rend="i">Image and Text: Studies in the Illustration</hi><pb id="p28-109" n="109"/><hi rend="i">of English Literature</hi> (London: Scolar P, 1982) 69-76,
                            rather than the potted version contained in the same author’s <hi rend="i">Five Centuries of English Book Illustration</hi> that is
                            cited by Essick.</p>
            <p>p. 25: Essick’s catalogue entries discuss many of Blake’s
                            possible borrowings of specific motifs from the book illustrations he
                            was commissioned to engrave. Looking at #V(3) one feels tempted to
                            suggest an additional, non-iconographic connection between
                            Blake’s work as a professional “copy” engraver and
                            the compositional treatment of his own, “original”
                            designs. Here, in Conrad Martin [?] Metz’s design for “The
                            Fugitive Shechemites” (Fig. 14) the relation between the actual
                            two-dimensional picture plane and the illusion of pictorial space is, I
                            think, reminiscent of the same relation in a considerable number of
                            Blake’s compositions that use the vertical axis for sequencing
                            both narrative time and pictorial space (see, e.g., “The Descent
                            of Man into the Vale of Death,” the related plate among the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> illustrations, or the “Epitome for James
                            Hervey’s <hi rend="i">Meditations among the
                            Tombs</hi>”).</p>
            <p>p. 31: #XI(4), the plate after Stothard for <hi rend="i">David
                                Simple</hi>, may have been the eidetic image at the back of
                            Blake’s mind when he was drawing the figure of the nurse for
                            plate 2 of “A Cradle Song” in <hi rend="i">Innocence.</hi></p>
            <p>p. 42: commenting on #XIX(2), the plate after Rubens’s
                            “Democritus,” Essick suggests that “Blake may have
                            based his plate on the engraving of the portrait by Lucas
                            Vorsterman”; there is nothing to be said against such a
                            possibility, and yet it seems more likely to me that (in Blake’s
                            case just as elsewhere) the full-page illustrations in the earlier
                            German and French editions of Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Essays</hi>
                            served as models for the British engravers.</p>
            <p>p. 48: Essick’s measurements for #XXI(11) read “8.7
                            × 10.6 cm.”; this appears to be a typo for “8.7
                            × 16.6 cm.”</p>
            <p>p. 50: capitalize “Zeichnungen,” and read
                            “gestochen” for “gestocken” in the German
                            title of Chodowiecki’s illustrations to Salzmann’s <hi rend="i">Elementarbuch.</hi></p>
            <p>p. 54: capitalize “<hi rend="i">Years</hi>” in the citation
                            of the title inscription for #XXIII(17); this minor change is certainly
                            open to debate, but compare “<hi rend="i">Want</hi>” in
                            the title quoted for #XXIII(20).</p>
            <p>p. 60: in the reference to Windle’s 1988 Wollstonecraft
                            bibliography, read “no. 17” for “no. 3” (the
                            latter is Windle’s entry for <hi rend="i">Original
                            Stories</hi>).</p>
            <p>p. 66: in the signatures of the two plates that were engraved by Blake
                            and that are here catalogued as #XXX(1-2), a “Xaverius Della
                            Rosa” is credited as the artist who “evidently made [the]
                            drawings of [the] statues” in Verona. Though Essick could
                            “find no information” about this draughtsman, the latter
                            is probably to be identified with the Veronese painter and etcher
                            Saverio Dalla Rosa (1745-1821). Dalla Rosa is not a complete unknown in
                            the history of Italian eighteenth-century art and art theory, and a
                            brief biographical account is easily accessible in volume 28 of the <hi rend="i">Allgemeines Lexikon der bildenden Künstler von der
                                Antike bis zur Gegenwart</hi> (ed. Ulrich Thieme and Felix
                            Becker).</p>
            <p>p. 69: for the reference to “(Bentley 1969, p. 12)” read
                            “(. . . , p. 56 n. 1).”</p>
            <p>p. 75: in his entry for Blake’s engraved portrait of “The
                            Late Mr. Wright of Derby,” Essick states that he has “not
                            been able to trace the drawing, painting, or print on which
                            Blake’s plate is based.” It seems very likely, though,
                            that Blake’s model was—a copy of or the original drawing
                            for?—a drypoint etching, presumably executed by the painter
                            himself. This scarce print, a copy of which was in the collection of
                            George Cumberland, is included in Tim Clayton’s “Catalogue
                            of the Engraved Works of Joseph Wright of Derby.”<ref target="n69" type="note">16</ref><note id="n69"><hi rend="s">16</hi> See Judy Egerton, et al., <hi rend="i">Wright of Derby</hi>, exh. cat. (London: Tate Gallery

                                Blake’s copy engraving is mentioned by Clayton.</note></p>
            <p>p. 83: in the title quoted for #XLII (as well as in the index [137]) read
                            “George Steevens” for “George Stevens.” The
                            measurements for #XLII(1) in <hi rend="i">CBI</hi> read “16.5
                            × 25.5 cm.” On my ruler, however, I read “16.5 (or
                            16.6) × 23.5 cm.,” a discrepancy that is too large to be
                            accounted for by paper shrinkage and similar effects.</p>
            <p>p. 84: similarly, the measurements cited by Essick for #XLII(2) read
                            “10 × 7.9 cm.,” whereas I found the actual height
                            of the image in this plate to be 10.5 cm.</p>
            <p>p. 85: the publishers’ names in the imprint for #XLIII(4) have
                            been transcribed as “Cadell &amp; Davies’ Strand,”
                            and, in fact, this is what the letters look like at first sight.
                            However, if one compares the “s” in “Davies”
                            in this engraving with the same letter in the same position in
                            #XLIII(1-3 and 6) or with Blake’s scratched inscriptions in other
                            plates of the Felpham period such as the “Weather-House”
                            tailpiece for Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Life of Cowper</hi>
                            (#XLIV[4]), it becomes clear, I think, that the small vertical stroke at
                            the end of “Davies” in the fourth plate Blake executed for
                            the 1803 edition of Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Triumphs of Temper</hi>
                            was, at the very least, not intended to be read as an apostrophe, but
                            simply to be part of the lower case letter “s.” If one
                            insists on reading “Davies’” in the imprint for
                            #XLIII(4), then <pb id="p28-110" n="110"/> one may as well read
                            “Caclell” for “Cadell” in #XXXIX(3).</p>

            <p>p. 105: from Essick’s preface readers learn that measurements are
                            supplied according to art historical conventions, i.e., “height
                            followed by width,” and “are of the pictorial image
                            exclusive of frames, borders, and inscriptions unless noted
                            otherwise” (vi). In theory this method of reference may seem both
                            simple and unequivocal enough; in practice, at least occasionally, even
                            measurements involve an act of interpretation and may therefore cause
                            some vexation.<ref target="n72" type="note">19</ref> Here is an
                            appropriate example. The measurements Essick supplies for #LI(20),
                            “15.3 × 23.9 cm.,” are exactly the same as my own,
                            if, that is, one measures the framing lines of the pictorial image on
                            the right and at the top. If, however, one measures the same engraving
                            on the left and at the bottom framing line, one ends up with only
                            “15.1 × 23.4 cm.” Similar discrepancies between
                            left and right as well as top and bottom measurements can be observed in
                            many other plates (see, e.g., #LI[27 or 30]), and ideally the author
                            would have told his readers precisely <hi rend="i">where</hi> the height
                            and width of the printed images were measured. And yet this may well be
                            asking too much. Essick, no doubt, is well aware of such possible
                            discrepancies. However, with engravings that have been bound in a book
                            it is often difficult to measure at the inner margin (which, in
                            approximately 50% of all cases) may happen to be the margin that the
                            rule would call for. Therefore, users of <hi rend="i">CBI</hi> (as in
                            the case of any other print catalogue I have used extensively) will have
                            to live with a few of these occasionally irritating measurements. I
                            cannot possibly end this note, however, without emphasizing that I was
                            as much impressed by the accuracy of the measurements cited in <hi rend="i">CBI</hi> as by all the other data supplied for each print.
                            As a reviewer I assumed an obligation to search <hi rend="i">CBI</hi>
                            for factual mistakes of this kind; after having measured for myself more
                            than 60% of the 271 prints described in the new catalogue, I can only
                            say that I was thoroughly frustrated in this attempt. <note id="n72"><hi rend="s">19</hi> This is particularly true, and very obviously
                                so, where an oval engraving or an irregularly shaped pictorial image
                                has to be measured.</note></p>
            <p>p. 123: at the end of the entry for #11 in the book’s second
                            appendix read “James Neagle” instead of “John
                            Neagle.” I return to this correction, previously noted in
                            Essick’s own “New Information on Blake’s
                                Engravings,”<ref target="n73" type="note">20</ref> merely in
                            order to point out that the decisive evidence for the correct version of
                            Neagle’s Christian name comes neither from the <hi rend="i">DNB</hi> nor any other standard reference work.<ref target="n74" type="note">21</ref> Rather, such evidence is provided by the
                            signatures on quite a few of the plates executed by this engraver. Many
                            of Neagle’s engravings have been signed with only the
                            artist’s second name, or as engraved by “J.
                            Neagle.” However, there are also quite a few of his plates with a
                                “Ja<hi rend="s">s</hi>. Neagle” inscription, and I
                            know of at least one plate that is signed by “James
                            Neagle,” whereas I have never seen a single plate the execution
                            of which has been attributed by the artist himself or by some writing
                            engraver to a “John Neagle.” <note id="n73"><hi rend="s">20</hi> See <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 25 (1991-92): 167.</note><note id="n74"><hi rend="s">21</hi> However, and thinking of printed

          <p>The power of Charles Minahen’s <hi rend="i">Vortex/t: The Poetics of
                            Turbulence</hi> resides in its willingness to speculate creatively with
                        somewhat limited evidence. However, the work also has holes, and while
                        perhaps appropriate given its attempted “hermeneutical disclosure of
                        symbolic turbulence” in diverse philosophical and poetic writings,
                        these holes qualify somewhat the insights achieved. Those wishing to derive
                        maximum benefit from the book should invert normal reading procedure and
                        proceed immediately to the work’s closing appendix to come to grips
                        with the confusing terms “Vortices, Helices, Spirals, and
                        Gyres” often wrongly applied to related but different phenomena.
                        Normally, such a definition of terms occurs at the opening of a work, but
                        the inverse reading has the function of tapping the processes diachronically
                        and synchronically explored in the three major divisions of the book. The
                        appendix traces vortical phenomena “at all levels of the known
                        universe,” which are “widely dispersed through the whole range
                        of phenomena from the micro- to the macrocosmic, and inhering in both
                        organic and inorganic systems and states” (149). Yet the terms
                        (vortex, helix, spiral, gyre) differ in their spatial properties, and these
                        differences are crucial in Minahen’s mapping of “symbolic
                        turbulence” (3) in the authors considered in his study.</p>
          <p>In exploring the differences in the specific definitions of the varied yet
                        related terms of turbulence, readers gain insights grounded in physical
                        phenomena, and this grounding makes legible the barrage of technical
                        language at the beginning of Minahen’s complicated assessment of the
                        literal presence and symbolic function of vortical figuration in widely
                        disparate works. The opening “Archaeology of Symbolic
                        Turbulence” (3) charts the “mystical cosmic and religious
                        significance” (3) of two types of symbols to establish a
                        characteristic structural dialectic of embodied “polar opposition and
                        synthesis” (3). The text then observes vortical symbols from the
                        Hebraic and Hellenic traditions and successfully argues that vortextual
                        processes, although different in their origins, undergird Western
                        epistemologies from “the whirlwind [as] Yahweh’s distinct
                        emblem” (10) to “vortical symbolism [that]. . . typifies the
                        Homeric conception of the cosmos” (14).</p>
          <p>Having identified literary and philosophic aspects of symbolic turbulence
                        embedded in Hellenic and Hebraic thought and practice, Minahen undertakes an
                        exploration of “vortical cosmogonic theory” (20) in relation
                        to the pre-Socratic philosophers Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, and
                        Democritus, and the chasm between poetry and science in Western tradition:
                        “[Aristotle’s] response is indicative of the tension, in the
                        episteme, between the more rigorous ‘scientific’ method
                        espoused by Aristotle, concerned with the validity of the mechanics of the
                        theory, and the ‘poetic’ tradition which Empedocles is still a
                        part of and which Aristotle ignores altogether” (20). While the
                        chapter is set up as a diachronic exploration of thinkers concerned with
                        “a matrix from which the entire Western tradition of discursive
                        thinking issues” (15), it offers one noticeable critical anachronism
                        when Yeats’s <hi rend="i">A Vision</hi> is used to illustrate the
                        conceptual possibility of “the Empedoclean double process”
                        (22). While Yeats’s gyres give the “perfect example of
                        dialectic (i.e., polarity, antithesis, and synthesis, simultaneously and/or
                        in sequence)” (21), his presence in a chapter on pre-Socratic
                        thinkers breaks an otherwise implied historical progression. Furthermore,
                        given both Yeats’s exploitation of the vortex at the foundation of
                        his ‘system’ and his appropriation of the concept from Blake
                        (who is discussed in chapter 7), this brief inclusion only points to the
                        more striking exclusion of Yeats from his logical position, towards the end
                        of the book. What binds the pre-Socratics is the element of chance or
                        necessity at work in “sequences of mechanical interaction”
                        (25), rendering the diverse expression of vorticality in their thought
                        “as much a metaphor as a scientific cosmogonic principle”
                            (25).<ref target="n75" type="note">1</ref><note id="n75"><hi rend="s">1</hi> However, as Roger Jones discusses in his
                                <hi rend="i">Physics as Metaphor</hi> (Minneapolis: U of Minnesota
                            P, 1982), there is some validity to the representational interweaving of
                            physics and metaphor: “we were all poets and the world was our
                            metaphor,” since “the observer and observed form an
                            integrated unit that cannot be broken down into independent
                            components” (3, 6).</note></p>
          <p>Minahen’s discussion of Plato’s “Great Whorl,” in
                        chapter 3, rightly focuses on the myth of Ur that concludes the <hi rend="i">Republic</hi>, and the mythic narrative of a soldier’s death and
                        return to life that brings him to view “a vision of the structure of
                        the cosmos” (28). The cosmos, gyrating hemispheres that correspond to
                        astrological and planetary movements, is a “revolving vault”
                        (28), with eight “whorls in all, lying within one another”
                        (29), and its operations are linked to that of a “free circular
                        vortex,” where “velocities vary in a manner inversely <pb id="p28-112" n="112"/> proportional to the distance from the central
                        axis” (33). One’s reservations about this chapter stem not
                        from the technically dense language, a type of hermetic scientism, but
                        rather from the rhetorically manufactured debate with an isolated critic (in
                        this case, Francis M. Cornford), which detracts from the significant insight
                        that “the Great Whorl represents a culmination, an apex, in the
                        development of an epistemic vortex symbol” (36).</p>
          <p>The same critical practice that structures chapter 3 continues in chapter 4,
                        “Epicurean Whirlings and Lucretius’s Turbulent Flux,”
                        where Minahen confronts Donald A. Mackenzie’s denial of the vorticity
                        in the thought of Epicurus. The crux of the matter hinges upon
                        Epicurus’s discomfort with the role that “necessity” or
                        “chance” plays in pre-Socratic and Platonic thought, due to
                        “the teleological implications” (38) of the <hi rend="i">clinamen</hi> or random swerve at the foundation of atomist theory.
                        Although Epicurus cites certain meteorological phenomena as demonstrative of
                        the presence of the vortex, his thought does “lack the symbolic
                        multivocity of other examples we have seen” (38). In contrast to the
                        use of previous interpretations as critical cannon-fodder, Minahen’s
                        confrontation with conflicting interpretations of Lucretius’s <hi rend="i">De Rerum Natura</hi> (Mackenzie versus Michel Serres)
                        successfully provides a frame for Lucretius’s cosmology of
                        “many vortices coming into and out of existence in ever-changing
                        complexes of colliding atoms and swarming fluid flows” (40). As a
                        result, his use of Lucretius as the terminus to the opening section elevates
                        the concluding discussion of “the vortex” (48), clarifying
                        “its evolution into so rich and complex a symbol by the end of the
                        classical age” (48) and its “reemerge[nce] as a quintessential
                        symbol of the late Medieval Christian vision in the work of Dante”
                        (48).</p>
          <p>Once into the second section, “Visionary Break-through,”
                        Minahen’s text supplies just that, breaking through its negative
                        dialogical engagement with isolated critics to confront the complexities of
                        Dante’s use of “circular, spiral, and vortical properties [as]
                        a reservoir of symbolic possibilities with which to fashion his mystical
                        vision of the after-life” (51). In “Dante’s Vortical
                        Triptych” (chapter 5), Minahen does justice to the prevalent layering
                        of spiral, vortical, and helical symbols in the large structures of hell,
                        purgatory, and heaven and in the smallest descriptive details, with the
                        minute particulars of local symbolism reinforcing the grand gyrations of
                        bodies and spheres. The most obvious example is hell; the pit spirals
                        downward to a singularity, powered by the “association of vortical
                        turbulence with sin” (54) appropriated from St. Augustine, and
                        displays characteristics defined by “the concentric streamlines of a
                        ‘free circular vortex’ . . . . in which the velocities are
                        backward [fast on the periphery and stagnant at the center]”
                        (52).</p>
          <p>Dante’s sensitivity to structural possibilities in vortical phenomena
                        can be seen when “purgatory reveals itself to be an enantiomorph of
                        hell, turned inside-out” (59). The prototypical spiro-helical
                        qualities of pyramids and mountains are pressed into Dante’s service,
                        and, true to its inverse relationship with hell, activity intensifies with
                        the ascent just as, in hell, activity decreases with descent.
                        “Whereas hell and purgatory are visible entities in Dante’s
                        scheme . . . the system of concentric crystalline spheres of the Ptolemaic
                        universe . . . is transparent and invisible” (62). This obvious
                        difference and its moral implications lead Minahen into a discussion of the
                        “four great symbols” (63) that structure paradise: “the
                        ‘wheel’ of planetary orbits”; “the ‘nest
                        of hemispheres’ . . . that turn on the axis of the North
                        Star”; “the primum mobile,” and “the celestial
                        rose” (63). The interweaving of these symbols brings
                        “concentrically circular, spirohelical, or vortical
                        structures” (63) into conjunction in such a way that deity can be
                        both center and circumference, and the terms and instances of vorticality
                        increase as the poet moves through the heavens. The penultimate and ultimate
                        images of vortical phenomena in heaven are the juxtaposed primum mobile and
                        celestial white rose, and Minahen’s analysis of the “paradox
                        of this inverse double image” (69) justifies his conclusion that
                        Dante’s “elaboration of spiro-vortical symbolism” has
                        been of “seminal importance in the history of ideas” (69).</p>
          <p>The brief analysis of Descartes, in “The Turbulent Dream-Vision of
                        Descartes’s ‘Olympian’ Experience” (chapter 6),
                        provides a transition into the modern period of “scientific
                        cosmology” (71) yet resists the exploration of the vortices upon
                        which Descartes built his mechanics of planetary movement, preferring,
                        instead, to examine a tripartite dream vision experienced by Descartes which
                        proved pivotal to the development of his thought. This is a clever and wise
                        procedure, and Minahen’s “reading” of
                        Descartes’s dream provides a tangible example of the
                        philosopher’s symbolic intertwining of “physics and
                        metaphysics” at the foundation of his material analysis. Minahen
                        concludes that “Descartes’s turbulent cosmology was thus
                        figuratively correct, even if literally misapplied, since the vortical
                        configuration is ubiquitous in the universe” (72). Minahen’s
                        selection also skillfully bridges the gap between the Ptolemaic Christian
                        vision of Dante and the post-Newtonian visionary physics <pb id="p28-113" n="113"/> pursued by Blake. Descartes’s dream reveals him as a
                        man grappling with “a profound conflict between science and religion,
                        knowledge and faith, vanity and deference to divinity” (83), and
                        these dualities, characteristic of vortical phenomena in nature,
                        symbolically “anticipate such important antitheses as body and soul,
                        doubt and certainty, dream and reality” that shaped philosophical
                        discourse in the eighteenth century. Additionally, the focus on
                        “dream” helps shorten the distance between the material
                        dualism of Descartes and Blake’s radical eradication of dualities,
                        since Blake too turns to dream discourse for solutions.</p>
          <p>The next chapter, “‘. . . That Every Thing Has Its/Own Vortex .
                        . . ‘: Dialectics of Vortical Symbolism in Blake,” ends the
                        center section of the text with Blake’s “pithy, if somewhat
                        cryptic, synthesis of many of the vortical images examined
                        heretofore” (85). Minahen discusses the symbol’s verbal and
                        visual manifestations to explore Blake’s negative and positive uses
                        of spiral and vortical imagery: the former associated with Urizen’s
                        vortical passage in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> (Night 6) and with plate
                        11 of the Job illustrations; the latter associated with the famous
                        “vortex” passage from <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and plate 13 of
                        the Job illustrations. The ambiguities of Blake’s use of the vortex
                        are considered at the conclusion of the chapter through one of
                        Blake’s better-known watercolors to Dante, “Beatrice
                        Addressing Dante from the Car”; Beatrice represents the
                        “Female Will,” and the painting “epitomizes the
                        equivocal, dialectical function of the vortex in Blake’s art”
                        (95). As these last formulations indicate, this chapter adds little to our
                        understanding of Blake, his use of the vortex, or his place in a line of
                        thinkers operating in a counter-linear fashion in relation to culture. There
                        are some troubling generalizations scattered throughout this and other
                        chapters: for example, Minahen’s claim that Blake reinforces
                        “lefthandedness” (90) as the direction of error ignores
                        Blake’s propensity for inverting exactly these stereotypical
                        categories, as in the title page to <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and
                            Hell.</hi></p>
          <p>The last section of the book, “Threshold of the Unknown,” opens
                        with “Descents into Poe’s Maelstrom” (chapter 8), in
                        which Minahen “consider[s] Edgar Allan Poe a symbolist along with
                        Rimbaud and Mallarmé” (101). Certainly, all three writers
                        liberate the vortical symbolism from its nebulous dependence upon
                        “necessity” in the first section and the markedly Christian
                        orientation found in the second section, and the growth of the symbol from
                        Poe to Mallarmé might very well “identify a specific
                        nineteenth-century symbolist episteme” (102). It is not new to find
                        “‘the recurrence of the <hi rend="i">spiral</hi> or <hi rend="i">vortex</hi>’ as one of [Poe’s] most pervasive
                        symbols” (quoting Richard Wilbur 102), and Minahen examines such
                        symbols in Poe’s early “MS. Found in a Bottle” and the
                        later “A Descent into the Maelstrom.” Both stories, which
                        conclude with a narratorial descent into a watery vortex, present
                        “the vortex [a]s literally a natural destructive force” (103).
                        In the first, the natural experience collapses into a teleological event
                        with “Dantesque” overtones of “evil, hopelessness, and
                        death” (106). In the second, the narrator’s visual observation
                        of a vortex, punctuated by an old sailor’s verbal narration of
                        surviving his passage through one, takes on the aesthetic and dramatic
                        dimensions of the sublime and the cathartic. Both stories achieve, in lesser
                        and greater degree (respectively), a double <hi rend="i">mise en adyme</hi>,
                        an interpenetration of content and style as well as the intertwining of
                        narrative layers. According to Minahen, “the paradox of Poe’s
                        vortex” resides in its ambiguous functions as
                        “threshold” and “state of suspension” (112), but
                        this could be said about several of the previous writers; Minahen’s
                        singular focus on the natural and symbolic correspondences between text and
                        world creates blindspots that could be pursued to widen the effects of
                        vortical symbolism as a viable epistemology.</p>
          <p>My point here is simply illustrated. When we apply, as I believe we must,
                        terms and concepts drawn from quantum mechanics and relativistic physics to
                        our discussions of the structure and effects of literary phenomena, as
                        Minahen does in evoking terms drawn from black hole theory in this chapter
                        (104), then we are equally obligated to perform an analysis of
                        psyche’s role in the construction of that reality, since the two are
                        inseparably entwined, as both the poet Blake and the physicist Heisenberg
                        know too well. Given the attention paid to Poe by postmodern critics (Lacan,
                        Derrida, Holland, et al.), it seems inconceivably neglectful to cite Marie
                        Bonaparte’s rather infantile and shallow reading of Poe, when the
                        full psychoanalytic dimensions of Poe’s use of the symbol in fact
                        support a reading that his and all texts incorporating <hi rend="i">mise en
                            abyme</hi> techniques often function as ‘vortexts.’<ref target="n76" type="note">2</ref><note id="n76"><hi rend="s">2</hi> I discuss such
                            “vortextuality” in “‘Vortext’ as

                            use of the Yin/Yang symbol, the very symbol that opens Minahen’s
                            attempted archaeological recovery of the vortical episteme, in his
                            discussion of inversions, double structures, and reversals in

          <p>Minahen’s analysis of vortex as modern episteme achieves significant
                        insights when confronting the poetic phenomena unleashed in chapter 9,
                        “‘Tourbillons de Lumiere’: Rimbaud’s
                        Illuminating Vortices.” <pb id="p28-114" n="114"/> Minahen approaches
                        Rimbaud’s “bizarre symbolic universe” (115) at both the
                        level of image and the literal level of appearance of words floating on
                        blank pages with interesting results, although a similar approach in the
                        Blake and Poe chapters would bolster and complicate the symbol’s
                        efficacy there in forcing the “breakdown in the linguistic sign
                        itself” (116) observed in several of Rimbaud’s poems. Clearly,
                        Rimbaud’s most intense engagement with symbolic turbulence occurs in
                        three “illuminations” (“Marine,”
                        “Mouvement,” and “Mystique”), and the analyses
                        of these poems are illuminating. In “Marine,” the “free
                        association of subject-predicate” evokes a stylistic vortical
                        dynamic, tapping the “opposition, tension, and possible
                        fusion” (118) that the symbol has gathered to itself in its passage
                        through time. The turbulence discussed in “Mouvement” grows
                        out of “vortical synecdoches that abound throughout the text”
                        (120) and unveils “the vertiginous ‘dis-covery’ of
                        poetic insight” (123). The last poem, “Mystique,”
                        differs from the previously discussed illuminations in its movement away
                        from aquatic contexts and toward the poem as “a window into a kind of
                        noumenal world beyond that of phenomenal appearances” (124). These
                        readings support Minahen’s contention that “the Rimbaldean
                        vortex is a metamorphosing entity . . . that develops across the young
                        poet’s career, becoming increasingly hermetic and complex”
                        (127).</p>
          <p>“Whirling Toward the Void in Dead Center: Symbolic Turbulence in
                        Mallarmé’s <hi rend="i">Un Coup de des</hi>” (chapter
                        10) clarifies the metaphorical differences in “the symbolist concept
                        of reality” (129) that become apparent in the nexus of their
                        turbulent representations. Mallarmé’s use of the shipwreck
                        reaccesses the associations of aquatic phenomena with vortical symbolism
                        found in all three sections of Minahen’s text, and the graphic
                        dispersal of terms on the page embodies the oppositions explored in the
                        poem’s content in a manner analogous to Rimbaud’s. Confronting
                        Mallarmé’s poetic “epistemological statement that
                        depicts the complex, fragmented nature of thought” (130), Minahen
                        enters the poem’s “absences and omissions” (130) to
                        elucidate “the vortex paradigm . . . established throughout”
                        (131). The effect of this effort, while admirable, accounts for the sense of
                        the chapter’s “constructed” feel; in this way, the poem
                        seems to function more like a mirror that comes to reflect the
                        author’s desire for closure, even though vortical symbolic clusters
                        are present. Mallarmé’s use of the vortex, where transcendent
                        ideas are subsumed in a vortex that leads to death, intersects practices
                        traced in all previous chapters but in inverse fashion, since
                        Mallarmé’s metaphors of turbulence function as “a
                        negating absence at the center of all experience” (141).</p>
          <p>In summary, although the work articulates, at the outset, <hi rend="i">a
                            desire to pursue</hi> these matters through “a synchrony of the
                        symbol” (ix), <hi rend="i">the actual pursuit</hi> is clearly
                        established as a diachronic sequence from earlier to later writers, creating
                        inexplicable holes where evidence seems to support the progression. Drawing
                        an example from the material most familiar to me, the chapter on Blake
                        places the poet in an epistemological line issuing forth from Descartes (in
                        spite of Blake’s repeated attacks on Cartesian dualism) and situates
                        Blake’s vortical practices within the framework of critical consensus
                        by powerful readers of Blake’s poetic and visual designs (Mitchell,
                        Raine, and Ault, among others). However, Minahen neglects to connect
                        Blake’s use of the vortex in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> to the intense
                        inquiries into cones of vision as vortical phenomena in the diverse writings
                        of Newton, Berkeley, Priestley (to name only a few) and, of course, Blake
                        himself. Worse still, the chapter neglects specific attempts to address
                        Blake’s use of the vortex; the most glaring omission, to this reader,
                        is failure to reference the information provided in Nelson Hilton’s
                        chapter of <hi rend="i">Literal Imagination</hi> entitled “Word and
                        Text: Vortex and Wheel,” although other examples could be cited.<ref target="n77" type="note">3</ref><note id="n77"><hi rend="s">3</hi> E.g., Kay Parkhurst Easson and Roger

                            vortical in nature (145-50) and the vortex itself as
                            “Blake’s image of spiritual travel” (151
                            ff.).</note></p>
          <p>There is much to recommend a reading of <hi rend="i">Vortex/t: The Poetic of
                            Turbulence</hi>, for the continuity and development of vortical
                        symbolism as a counter epistemology capable of embodying the inner and outer
                        turbulence of thought and experience is thoroughly established. However,
                        there is considerable room for disagreement with individual readings in the
                        text, and readers should be prepared to engage the text dialogically,
                        probing the limits of Minahen’s application of vortical processes and
                        entering, in the process, the vortex of mental strife that Blake terms
                        “mental war.”</p>
