        <p>When <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi><ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> went to
                    press in July 1971, it was complete through 1970. In the years until its
                    publication on 31 March 1977, a good deal more information on Blake was
                    published, including over one hundred dissertation abstracts, and some obscure
                    originals were discovered or rediscovered. This information was incorporated as
                    far as possible in the text of <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> or in addenda to it
                    (pp. 951-1001), but of course even these addenda, completed in the winter of
                    1976, were out of date when the book was published. Further, since I was in
                    India, with very limited library resources, from June 1975 until March 1976, the
                    effective terminus for the addenda was about April 1975, except for works which
                    kind correspondents drew to my attention. <note id="n1"><hi rend="s">1</hi> G.
                        E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Books:</hi> Annotated Catalogues of
                        William Blake’s Writings in Illuminated Printing, in Conventional

        <p>The present supplement, then, is intended to bring <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>
                    up to date, incorporating all the relevant information available up to its
                    publication on 31 March 1977.<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> The symbols
                    and abbreviations are the same as those in <hi rend="i">A Blake
                        Bibliography</hi> (1964) and <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (1977). <note id="n2"><hi rend="s">2</hi> The largest lacunae are probably from foreign
                        (particularly Japanese) publications such as the issue of <hi rend="i">Mizue</hi>, No. 816 ([Tokyo] 1973), 11-59 entirely devoted to Blake
                        with 56 plates (I have been unable to obtain a copy or ascertain the
                        contents), or newspaper accounts such as the scores of German reviews of the
                        Hamburg and Frankfurt Blake exhibitions detailed in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>,
                        XI (1977), 48-9.</note></p>
        <p>The question of numbers for additons to <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> is a vexing
                    one. For new editions, the problem is simple enough; a second edition of, say,
                    no. 190 is lettered B: 190B, and a fifth edition or printing of it is 190E. For
                    new books and essays, however, it is not so easy. In <hi rend="i">Blake
                        Books</hi>, there are some intercallations, e.g., a work which belongs
                    between 109 and 110 is numbered A109, a second is B109, and so on. If a work
                    should be later found which should go between A109 and B109, it would be
                    numbered AA109, and a second, later intercallation would be AB109. This is
                    obviously very clumsy. The problem is that the bibliography grows
                    chronologically, whereas five of its six sections are organized alphabetically.
                    The numbers of this supplement are based on those of <hi rend="i">Blake
                        Books</hi>, though this becomes increasingly awkward, particularly for
                    authors who are prolific and at other growth points such as Catalogues and
                    Bibliographies.</p>
        <p>In future, additions to <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> should probably be
                    identified by Part and Section (e.g., I B for Part I Writings, Section B
                    Collections and Selections, or VI for Part VI Biography and Criticism), the
                    year, and the first word of the entry (<hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> or Essick).
                    Thus an edition of <hi rend="i">The Writings of William Blake</hi> published in
                    1977 would be identified as "IB 1977 <hi rend="i">Writings</hi>", and Bier, Jesse, "Blake’s
                    Fortune-Cookie", <hi rend="i">Enco Products News Bulletin</hi>, XLI
                    (1959), 14-182, would be identified as "VI 1959 Bier". This
                    will create redundancies only when, say, Bier publishes two articles in 1959, an
                    uncommon enough occurrence. In practice, this will mean that further supplements
                    to <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> may appear with Part and Section heads, but
                    that entries in each Section will need to be preceeded only by the date (not by
                    a separate, arbitrary, number) — and this is already done in the
                    present arrangement for Part IV Catalogues and Bibliographies. I hope that this

            <p>This edition is a curious bastard throughout, with very mixed and
                            unacknowledged parentage. (a) For one thing, the irregular new dates on
                            the plates (19 May to 21 Nov. 1811) seem to point to yet another
                            edition, as yet untraced, of 1811, published presumably by Charles Cooke
                            (1760-1816), whose imprint is on the plates. (b) For another, the two
                            titlepages are not congruent, one citing T. Kelly as publisher with the
                            date but no printer (Kelly was at 17 Paternoster Row from at least
                                1820<ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref>), and the other citing
                            Charles Cooke as publisher with the printer but no date. Probably the
                            work changed hands after Cooke’s death, but the second
                            titlepage did not record the change—or the McGill set (the
                            only one reported<ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref>) is a mixed set.
                            In any case, it almost certainly was not ‘STEREOTYPED . . .
                            FOR T. KELLY’, though it may well have been
                            ‘PRINTED FOR’ him. (c) For another, David Cock,
                            who appears as the printer in the colophon to both volumes at 75 Dean
                            Street, was at that address only in 1810-1815.<ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref> Presumably Cock made the stereotype plates but
                            did not print them at Dean Street after 1815. (Notice that Cock appears
                            only on the undated ‘PRINTED FOR C. COOKE’
                            titlepage.) (d) For another, neither titlepage nor contents (e.g., the
                            Advertisement on I, 5) acknowledges the relationship of this edition to
                            the previous two-volume Harrison edition (n.d.) or to the original
                            edition with these designs in <hi rend="i">The Novelist’s
                                Magazine</hi>, Vol. X-XI (1783). (e) For another, the designs are
                            the same as those in <hi rend="i">The Novelist’s
                                Magazine</hi>, reduced from 28 to 15 and with some plates
                            (presumably those irreparably worn) reengraved though bearing the names
                            of the same designer (appropriately) and engraver (quite wrongly,
                            presumably). For instance, Blake’s second plate was
                            re-engraved and signed ‘<hi rend="i">Scatchard</hi> [<hi rend="i">i.e.</hi>, Stothard] <hi rend="i">del.</hi>’
                                ‘<hi rend="i">Blake sculp.</hi>’, though it
                            seems highly unlikely that the original engraver made this new plate.

                            5 acquired in 1976 by The Pierpont Morgan Library. The date is probably
                            about ‘<hi rend="i">1819</hi>’, as the published

                            The engraving is ‘extremely’ similar to the
                            printed version, and we can only speculate, as Thomas Lange does in <hi rend="i">TLS</hi> for 14 January 1977, that Blake’s
                            engraving did not leave sufficient space for Lowry to add the other

                        exhibition (‘The Artist of the Soul’) and capped by an
                        article by Fry (pp. 791-2). For Kerr, Fry, Jerrold, and R., it is a debate
                        on ‘What is Art?’ (p. 791), with Blake as a
                        touchstone. Fry says (p. 359) that ‘We are almost forced to
                        choose between Blake and the rest of British Art. . . . I vote for
                        Blake’. Kerr asserts (p. 256) that Blake’s pictures
                        are ‘not art at all. . . . They are hideous . . . above all, not
                        sane’.</p>

          <p>The first impression is one of sheer overwhelming size and of the Herculean
                        effort that must have gone into this book’s production. Have we
                        really churned out enough Blake criticism since 1964 to increase the
                        enchiridion dimensions of the Bentley &amp; Nurmi <hi rend="i">Bibliography</hi> to over one thousand pages? Not quite. <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> is far more than an updating of its predecessor, for
                        it supplies vast amounts of information in areas not even touched upon in
                        its prototype. Most significantly, Bentley has written a new census of the
                        illuminated books. There may be some initial resistance to replacing the
                        familiar and more elegantly printed pages of the Keynes &amp; Wolf <hi rend="i">Census</hi> with this bulky new bibliography. Some may grumble
                        over the format, particularly the use of densely packed charts, but the
                        amount and diversity of material require complex packaging. In the long run,
                            <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> will be accepted as the standard
                        bibliography in its field and will remain so for many years.</p>
          <p>When reviewing a work of this magnitude, one serves little purpose by setting
                        down general evaluations based on a casual overview or the spot checking of
                        a few entries. The slower and less showy work of correction and augmentation
                        is far more important. My intention is to deal with each of the six sections
                        of <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> in turn, plunging as quickly and deeply as
                        possible into those minute particulars which form the heart of any
                        bibliography.</p>

              </title>
            </head>
            <p>Bentley explains the organization and coverage of the volume in the
                            eleven page Introduction. He has "examined every original copy
                            of Blake’s works which could be located, in some ninety
                            collections ranging from Edinburgh to Auckland" (p. 9). Thus
                            Bentley has no doubt inspected more copies of Blake’s
                            writings than anyone else—save for their author. He has
                            replaced the "perfunctory descriptions" of
                            Blake’s writings in Bentley &amp; Nurmi with
                            "the results of work on the originals" (p. 11). A
                            final "Postscript" (p. 14) notes that "the
                            body of the text" includes entries to the end of 1970, but that
                            "most important works published by June 1974" have
                            been either added to the main sequence of entries or gathered in the
                            fifty-page "Addenda."</p>
            <p>The thirty-six page survey of Blake’s reputation and
                            interpreters takes the same broad, long-range perspective provided by
                            the earlier version in Bentley &amp; Nurmi. The emphasis is on
                            objective summarizing and pointing out the acknowledged high-points, but
                            Bentley sometimes reveals his own wry evaluations: "In Blake
                            studies, at least, there is an unfortunate connection between an
                            inclination to make psychological interpretations and scholarly
                            incompetence" (p. 48). Two points need correction. The
                            monochrome facsimile of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and
                                Hell</hi> edited by Clark Emery (Miami, 1963) does not reproduce the
                            Blake Trust facsimile of copy D (as Bentley states, p. 38 n. 3), but the
                            Dent facsimile (1927) of copy I (I warned you I was going to get
                            minute). As far as I understand the genesis of the <hi rend="i">Blake
                                Newsletter</hi> and <hi rend="i">Blake Studies</hi>, it is not in
                            fact true that the latter was established "in
                            imitation" (p. 49) of the former. The founding editors of <hi rend="i">Blake Studies</hi> tell me that they had already announced
                            their first issue before they learned of the existence of the <hi rend="i">Newsletter.</hi></p>

            <p>In the most important, and longest, section of his book, Bentley gives us
                            complete bibliographic descriptions of all of Blake’s
                            writings, including the letters and those prints bearing inscriptions
                            that are more than just titles. A considerable amount of information on
                            the illuminated books, either ignored or treated summarily in Keynes
                            &amp; Wolf, is now available, including individual plate sizes, <figure><head>2 Plate 6 in Cumberland, <hi rend="i">Thoughts on

                            height—the reverse of the conventional order in print
                            catalogues), binding history, offsets, original numeration, and
                            stab-hole measurements. Bentley has traced and described a good many
                            copies and fragments of copies not in Keynes &amp; Wolf, and
                            eliminated a few conjectural copies by identifying them with known ones.
                            This last improvement was made possible by more thorough recordings of
                            provenances. Valuable information is also provided on pairs of designs
                            with identical plate-mark dimensions, thus indicating that Blake used
                            both sides of his copperplates in most cases. The printing dates of many
                            copies have been revised in light of a more thorough consideration of
                            the sequence of variants than that provided by keynes &amp; Wolf.
                            Although this considerably alters the printing sequence for many titles,
                            and some past assumptions about Blake’s development as a
                            colorist, the old, familiar letter designations are retained, for which
                            we should all be thankful. Plate numbering is different for many titles
                            since Bentley has numbered all copies continuously, whereas Keynes
                            &amp; Wolf sometimes use roman numerals for front-matter. In the
                            plate numbering <pb id="p11-180" n="180"/> of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>,
                            Bentley and Keynes &amp; Wolf are the same, but Erdman’s
                                <hi rend="i">Illuminated Blake</hi> uses a different sequence, and
                            Erdman’s <hi rend="i">Poetry &amp; Prose</hi> and
                            Keynes’ <hi rend="i">Writings</hi> yet another. For <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Bentley, Keynes, and Keynes &amp; Wolf
                            are all in accord, following copy E; but Erdman follows copies A, C, and
                            F. All this can cause a good deal of confusion, and we should take pains
                            to make clear which system we are using in each case. The best long-term
                            solution will be to take <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> as the
                            standard.</p>
            <p>A similar set of problems confronts us in line numbering. The usual
                            practice has been to number each plate individually, but for most
                            illuminated books Bentley numbers the lines in one sequence for the
                            whole work, excluding preludia. For "The Song of
                            Liberty," the "line" references (for example,
                            in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> pp. 290, 297) are not to lines at all,
                            but to Blake’s numbered sentences, all but three of which
                            take up more than one line. Happily this clumsy method, requiring one to
                            count through a whole poem to find one of Bentley’s
                            references, is suspended for <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, and of course each poem in <hi rend="i">Songs of
                                Innocence and of Experience</hi> is separately numbered. I suspect
                            that Bentley will use the same, albeit inconsistent, system in his
                            forthcoming edition of Blake’s writings, and this should make
                            it easier to look up a line reference in <hi rend="i">Blake
                            Books.</hi></p>
            <p>For each plate, Bentley gives a part-line incipit followed by a brief
                            description of the design. These should be used only as identifying
                            notes on major design elements; Bentley makes no attempt to number every
                            streak on every tulip. Comparisons between Erdman’s
                            descriptions in <hi rend="i">The Illuminated Blake</hi> and
                            Bentley’s—a game I will not play here at any
                            length—show once again that there is no such thing as a
                            completely objective description of a picture. We are also given a good
                            deal of information on coloring, particularly of people and their dress.
                            These notes offer both nourishment and correction to those interested in
                            the pursuit of color symbolism.</p>
            <p>Bentley also deals with variants between copies of the same illuminated
                            book—a problem which, as he reminds us in the Introduction
                            (p. 9), is extremely tricky. Let me set down a few of my own conclusions
                            about this important issue, based on examinations of Blake’s
                            prints and on my own etching and printing of relief plates. Traditional
                            bibliography, based on the study of typographic printing, is incapable
                            of dealing with many elements of printing from relief blocks. The
                            bibliographer must give way to the chalcographer, and the first great
                            truth he must utter is that <hi rend="i">no two impressions from
                                Blake’s copperplates printed in relief are
                                identical.</hi> In relief printing, unlike intaglio, the ink spreads
                            over large areas relative to the total size of the image. The larger the
                            area, the greater the chance for accidental, uncontrollable, and <hi rend="i">visible</hi> variations in texture and color. Such factors
                            as ink viscosity, humidity, and air pressure can affect the appearance
                            of each impression. Far more than with modern inking rollers,
                            Blake’s inking balls made it easy to under-ink, or completely
                            miss, small relief plateaus, over-ink others, and foul bitten areas.
                            Because of these inevitable and uncontrollable differences between all
                            impressions, it is important to keep in mind the following five distinct
                            types of variants, listed in descending order of chalcographic
                            significance: <list type="ordered"><item><p><label>1.</label> Changes made in the plate. These have great
                                        significance since they take conscious effort to execute and
                                        have a high degree of permanence. Erasing black lines (i.e.,
                                        increasing bitten areas) is easy; adding black lines is
                                        difficult, although not impossible. Alterations of this type
                                        are the <hi rend="i">only</hi> ones which affect the
                                        "state" of the plate.</p></item><item><p><label>2.</label> Conscious alterations in inking or color
                                        printing the plate. These can take two basic forms: (a)
                                        Deletion of words or design elements by masking (as with the
                                        last four lines on <hi rend="i">America</hi> pl. 4 in copies
                                        B-F, H-M, R, a), by wiping the ink off (as with the plate
                                        edges in almost all of Blake’s eighteenth-century
                                        impressions), or by failure to ink certain areas. With
                                        simple failure to ink it is sometimes difficult to determine
                                        whether the change was purposeful or not. If the area is
                                        completely uninked (not just smudged) and is
                                        discrete—that is, limited to particular motifs
                                        and words surrounded by well inked areas—then the
                                        failure to ink probably took conscious effort. (b)
                                        Alterations in inking color, texture, or directional wiping
                                        (as in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> copy F).</p></item><item><p><label>3.</label> Conscious addition or elimination of design
                                        elements or text with ink or watercolors on individual
                                        impressions after printing.</p></item><item><p><label>4.</label> Pen &amp; ink work or coloring on

                                        lines not on the copperplate, or subtract them, but only
                                        underscores or tints what is already there.</p></item><item><p><label>5.</label> Accidental variants in inking or coloring,

                                        bounding lines, and other countless minor variations of all
                                        sorts.</p></item></list> Bentley properly deals almost exclusively with categories 1-3 in
                            his lists of variants. It is important to indicate, however, which type
                            of variant one is describing in each case, and <hi rend="i">Blake
                                Books</hi> sometimes fails to do this. Individual problems are dealt
                            with below.</p>
            <p>Bentley brings us to similar difficulties with categories in his notes on
                            drawings related to designs in the illuminated books and, in Part III,
                            in commercial book illustrations. There is a considerable difference
                            between a true preliminary drawing and an analogue. It is often
                            important to make a further distinction between analogues produced prior
                            to the design in question and those produced later, particularly when
                            tracing the development of a motif through Blake’s career. It
                            is frequently difficult to make these distinctions in each individual
                            case, but the bibliographer-chalcographer should seek the aid of the art
                            historian and give it a try if he is going to delve into the matter at
                            all. Bentley’s notes hover between a list of preliminaries
                            and a list of analogues, the latter sometimes masquerading as the
                            former. For example, on p. 86 we find that "there are sketches
                            on <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> pp. 75 (top right), 77 <pb id="p11-181" n="181"/> (bottom), and 17 [should read "71"]
                            related to designs on [<hi rend="i">America</hi>] pl. 7, 11,
                            14." Here, "related to" must mean different
                            things for each plate, for the sketch on <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> p.
                            71 is a preliminary for <hi rend="i">The Gates of Paradise</hi> pl. 17
                            and no more "related to" <hi rend="i">America</hi> pl.
                            14 (to use Bentley’s new numbers) than the engraving; the
                            sketch on p. 75 and the man and snake on <hi rend="i">America</hi> pl. 7
                            are variations on the same motifs but pictorially quite different; and
                            the prone infant on p. 77 is much closer to the one in <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, p. 23 of the engravings, than to <hi rend="i">America</hi> pl. 11. In his notes on <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pl.
                            10 (p. 153), Bentley states that the "sketch for the three
                            bottom figures appears on <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> p. 25."
                            But this sketch is no doubt a rejected preliminary (numbered 32 <hi rend="i">del.</hi>, 23) for a series of emblems that finally emerged
                            as <hi rend="i">The Gates of Paradise.</hi> Bentley’s
                            "for" could lead to a false impression about the
                            development of these important motifs which make their first appearance
                            in a water color of c.1779, usually called
                            "Pestilence" or "Plague,"<ref target="n17" type="note">1</ref> and then again in a slightly later
                            water color of the same subject.<ref target="n18" type="note">2</ref>
                            Bentley mentions only the first water color. His wording is misleading
                            when he notes (p. 254) that the verso sketch on the drawing of
                            "Albion Rose" (Victoria &amp; Albert Museum)<ref target="n19" type="note">3</ref> is "for" <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl. 76, and again when he states that the
                            wash drawing<ref target="n20" type="note">4</ref> of a battlefield scene
                            in the collection of the Earl of Crawford &amp; Balcarres is
                            "for" "The Counsellor, King, Warrior, Mother
                            &amp; Child in the Tomb" among the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>
                            illustrations. In each case, the design referred to is an early
                            appearance of the motifs in question, but is in no sense a preliminary
                            "for" the later work. In light of these art-historical
                            complexities that can take many sentences to explain fully, the best
                            recourse for the bibliographer may be to avoid preliminary and analogue
                            lists altogether. <note id="n17"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Repro. <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi>, 7 (1973), 4; collection of Donald

            <p>What follows is a list of additions and corrections to Part I, intermixed
                            with a few longer discussions or queries about particular points. I have
                            not added material outside the scope of Bentley’s coverage,
                            nor fussed over minor and subjective disagreements on color or
                            descriptions of designs. Except where I question a point or simply
                            indicate an area where more work must be done, I have a good deal of
                            confidence in my corrections to all parts of <hi rend="i">Blake

                            involved or high quality reproductions when these are sufficient. Many
                            of these corrections are minor, to say the least, but the importance of
                            Bentley’s book warrants a microscopic perspective. Unless
                            indicated otherwise, all page- and entry-number references and

                            the first two states backwards. The first state in the Bodleian
                            (Bentley’s copy B) is followed by the untraced second state
                            (copy I in Bentley’s list at the top of the page, but called
                            "A" in footnote 1) known through its description in
                            the Boston Museum of Fine Arts 1891 catalogue. This sequence is
                            confirmed by the presence of fragments of the second state inscriptions
                            on the third state but not on Bentley’s second state, which
                            therefore must be the true first.<ref target="n21" type="note">5</ref>
                            The second state (not the third, as Bentley has it) resides beneath the
                            Rosenwald color printed impression, and presumably beneath the more
                            thickly printed British Museum copy as well. <note id="n21"><hi rend="s">5</hi> The proper sequence was first pointed out by Erdman in

                                but by the fourth printing (1970) this has been corrected. Keynes,

                                proposes a date of 1803 or earlier for the final state, but like

                            states is wrong. The engraving beneath the Huntington color printed
                            copy, and no doubt beneath the more thickly printed British Museum copy,
                            is a first state lacking the inscription. There is no known impression
                            of this state printed in intaglio. The "Albion"
                            inscription was added c.1804 when the extensive burnishing and the worm
                            and bat-winged moth were also added to the plate. In footnote 3, Bentley
                            states that "Erdman, p. 804, guesses 1790-1 on the basis of the
                            rightward, conventional terminal ‘g’ in
                            ‘Giving’" as the date of the inscription.
                            The only work by Erdman I can find with a reference to "Ablion
                            Rose" on p. 804 is his edition of the <hi rend="i">Poetry
                                &amp; Prose</hi>, where he dates the inscription "1790

                            "to the late 1790s (or later)" by the fourth printing

                            burnishing techniques all point to an 1804 date for the second state

            <p><hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi>, no. 3, pp. 80-81. Bentley
                            indicates that all copies are color printed. With such small plates it
                            is difficult to tell the difference between true color printing and the
                            reticulated surface of thick watercolors that have dried quickly, and as
                            Bentley notes (p. 84), "the colour printing in both works [<hi rend="i">All Religions are One</hi> and <hi rend="i">No Natural
                                Religion</hi>] is very tentative." But if he is right, then
                            either all recorded copies were printed c.1795—a remarkable
                            situation—or the usual dating of Blake’s color
                            printing must be changed. Perhaps some of these small prints were made
                            with colored inks or blotted hand coloring, and thus represent an early
                            stage in Blake’s development of color printing
                            techniques.</p>

                            86, footnote 2. "The fact that the top lines of text on pl. 7
                            are curtailed by the design suggests that here at least the design was
                            etched before the text." I very much doubt that Blake
                            "etched" text and design at different times, for this
                            would require several extra steps of stopping-out and cleaning and would
                            create many unnecessary problems in text-design coordination. He may,
                            however, have painted the resist on the copper at different times. At
                            any time prior to etching, any curtailment of text lines could be
                            altered easily (by changing the design, or rewriting the text, or
                            adjusting the left margin) if Blake had wanted to. Since the text had to
                            be written or transferred onto the plate in reverse, the line breaks on
                            the right margin had to be worked out well before etching. There is no
                            way I can think of for telling which Blake painted on the plate
                            first—design or text—from the evidence of line
                            breaks or other spatial relationships between text and design. But it
                            does tell us that Blake was willing to alter his text lines in order to
                            make room for his designs, and I suspect that the reverse may also be
                            true in many cases. Bentley makes this point in regard to <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> on p. 144, footonte 1, but his suggestion that
                            "some of the design preceded the text" is not
                            necessarily true.</p>
            <p>P. 91, pl. 2 variants. "The printed cloud-line in copies A-M is
                            absent in copies N-Q." The cloud does appear in N, where it has
                            been drawn in ink as Bentley notes, p. 93, and in O and Q the entire
                            upper left corner is colored in so that the cloud line is still present
                            as a bounding line. I have not been able to check copy P. We need more
                            information here on whether these variants are in printing or in

                            the sort pictured in Blake’s white line etching of
                            "Death’s Door" and in

                            copperplate from Blake’s works in Illuminated Printing is a
                            fragment from the top right corner of this rejected plate from <hi rend="i">America.</hi>" The fragment is from the right
                            margin extending from the lower part of the "Y" of

                            The deletion marks noted by Bentley are of two types. The two horizontal
                            scratches through part of the first line may well be part of a
                            purposeful deletion; but the vertical gouges, too haphazard and deep to
                            be text deletions, through the right side of lines 4-5 were probably
                            created after the plate was cut up and at least this one piece given to
                            young Butts.</p>

                            seems far more likely that it was cut off at the top where the
                            fragmentary text appears.</p>
            <p>"Ancient of Days," no. 10, pp. 108-10. Even though this
                            plate bears no "writings," the colored impressions are
                            listed in a separate section here. Uncolored impressions not bound in
                            copies of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> are listed on p. 161. On p. 148,
                            Bentley suggests that the "Ancient of Days" was
                            printed from a different plate than the <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>
                            frontispiece—hence the separate entry for it. There are
                            indeed two plates of this design, but not quite in the way Bentley has
                            it. One colored impression in Keynes’ collection
                            (Bentley’s copy C, p. 107)<ref target="n23" type="note">7</ref> has rather different cloud outlines, larger crosshatching
                            patterns in the clouds on both sides of the figure’s extended
                            arm and in the upper right corner, fewer but bolder lines of radiance
                            below the clouds, a shorter beard on the figure, and a central disc
                            measuring 10.3 cm. in diameter—a full 6 mm. greater than in
                            all other versions I have measured. The differences among all other
                            impressions can be accounted for by differences in inking and coloring.
                            The fractional differences in plate-mark, given by Bentley, can be
                            accounted for by paper shrinkage (a phenomenon Bentley takes note of on
                            p. 67) and are no greater than variances (1 to 2 mm.) between separate
                            colored impressions themselves. All the separate colored impressions of
                            the "Ancient of Days" were printed from the same plate
                            as the <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> frontispiece—with the single

                            There is a period after "1794" (colored out in copy
                            G). "The logical, consecutive nature of the narrative is
                            emphasized by chapter- and section-numbers and by running
                            heads." It seems to me that Blake has set up a tension between
                            these mechanical, Bible-like divisions and his non-consecutive narrative
                            as a formal embodiment of the conflict between Urizen and the Eternals.
                            P. 167. Pl. 15 would also "seem to be etched over other
                            designs, as the odd swirls in copy D suggest," but I am not
                            certain about pl. 20. In copy D the coloring does not correspond to
                            relief surfaces, but this does not necessarily mean that fragments of an
                            earlier etching lie beneath pl. 20.</p>

            <p>P. 177, pl. 17. "The whole page is a design of a (?female)
                            figure with long hair and a Red skirt (but no top) who holds her ears as
                            she bends towards us over a flaming sphere." In the note on
                            "Colouring," the figure is called
                            "Enitharmon." Erdman, <hi rend="i">The Illuminated
                                Blake</hi>, p. 199, claims (rightly, I think) that the figure is Los
                            and that the globe is not "flaming" but pendant on
                            veins of blood. The disagreement here calls into question
                            Bentley’s contention that this is one of "many . . .
                            designs" in <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> which "illustrate
                            the text more literally than was often Blake’s
                            custom" (p. 166).</p>
            <p>P. 178, pl. 21 variants. "Enitharmon has her right hand in the
                            small of Orc’s back" in copy B as well as A. The
                            cloth she holds is absent from A.</p>
            <p>P. 178, pl. 22 variants. In copy G, the tears are on his cheeks, not
                            "in his eyes."</p>
            <p>P. 179, pl. 24. " . . . across the middle of the page floats a
                            man with his hands raised to shoulder level and a Red swirl coming from
                            his chest." The swirl is not visible in copies B, D, G, and is
                            probably just a highlighted cloud-line elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Variants: the top-most figure’s arms are not visible in copy
                            B. The reference to "Fuzon" and
                            "Grodna" are somewhat mysterious since these figures
                            are not located by name in the design description. According to Erdman,
                                <hi rend="i">The Illuminated Blake</hi>, p. 206, they are the

                            reference to a monochrome intaglio print, "colour"
                            traditionally means the linear patterns that create tone, but on this
                            plate these patterns are not the same on the faces and the ground.</p>

                            Bentley’s first and second in copy D. On pl. 5, copy D has
                            most of the work on the figure and the hatching lower left of the final
                            state, but lacks the additional hatching on the rocks lower right and a
                            few strokes on the man’s arms. On pl. 7, there are more
                            scales on the figure’s loins than in the first state, but
                            they do not extend as far up his belly as in the final state. This
                            intermediate state also lacks many fine lines on the figure. Blake seems
                            to have tinkered with <hi rend="i">For the Sexes</hi> to the end of his

                            and "ABEL" is still larger. The problem here is a good
                            example of the frequently encountered difficulty in reducing
                            Blake’s etched texts to typographic forms and the conventions
                            of <pb id="p11-184" n="184"/> descriptive bibliography based on them.
                            This, I suspect, is just what Blake wanted.</p>

                            does not lean "on the ground" but rests on the chest

                            Blake’s secret method of Illuminated Printing." This
                            seems unlikely because the surviving fragment says nothing about relief
                            etching and is probably just a gentle parody of Cumberland’s

            <p>P. 224, footnote 2. "Forty-two of the 52 (or more) copperplates
                            needed for <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> could have been formed from the

                            65) for the typeset text." This is very unlikely. The standard
                            eighteenth-century practice was for the publisher to purchase the
                            coppers in which he retained all rights after engraving. If Blake did
                            acquire the plates, he could not have made use of the unengraved centers
                            without cutting through the surrounding areas. This would have produced
                            a pile of odd pieces of copper and would have been far less economical
                            than scraping and burnishing the engraved areas to make use of the whole
                            plates.</p>

                            should be added to this list, and pl. 28 is largely white line. They are
                            basically etchings, not engravings, and printed in relief, not

                            ‘In’ in all other copies." I cannot find
                            this catchword in reproductions of copies C, D, or E, and on p. 250
                            Bentley states that the "catchword is gone in all" but

                            lacks the black squiggle lines on the rocks (below and on each side of
                            the central figure) and around the head and arm upper right, and also
                            lacks the contour lines on the legs and torso of the woman on the right,
                            all added to the second state (copies D, E). In the third state (copies
                            F, H, I, and no doubt posthumous copy J) there is further black line
                            shading on the rocks and in the upper right corner, plus additional
                            white line work in the hair of the top and right women. Bentley mentions
                            none of these interesting white and black line additions, some probably
                            made by engraving white lines and printing in relief from the burr.<ref target="n25" type="note">9</ref><note id="n25"><hi rend="s">9</hi> Alterations in this plate were first

            <p>P. 269. "The original and the engraving for Rees are faithful
                            copies of the cast, showing it without the hands, arms, and serpent
                            heads." All of Blake’s versions have all hands,
                            arms, and heads, as does the Royal Academy cast at present. I do not
                            know if the cast was ever incomplete, but I doubt it.</p>

                            "changes on pl. 24-25, 27 [in copies K-M] were made . . . on
                            the copperplate." On p. 297, Bentley notes that pl. 24
                            "was masked in printing, so that nothing shows of the design in
                            K"—which makes more sense than removal from the
                            copper. If pl. 27 of untraced copy M is indeed "<hi rend="i">without</hi> the 8-line Chorus at the end" (as the Linnell
                            sale catalogue of 15 March 1918 states), it was probably masked in
                            printing or simply cut out of the leaf. Auction catalogues are more
                            likely to record defects for the vendor’s protection against
                            returns than to note details for their own sakes.</p>

                            A." The "cloud" would seem not to be a
                            variant, for it appears in copies A-E, H, I, and is partly colored out
                            only in F. It is etched in the copper, as uncolored copy B shows.</p>
            <p>P. 293, pl. 6. "Below the text there appear to be non-functional

                            functional, but the leftward slant of the letters does suggest

                            on the left a "woman" (Bentley) or a man (Erdman, <hi rend="i">The Illuminated Blake</hi>, p. 226)?</p>
            <p>P. 317, pl. 38 variants. "In copy D, the man’s left

                            on her vagina." The left thumb has been painted in, and perhaps
                            extended a bit, but it is below her vagina and extends downward along
                            her inner thigh. Bentley does not mention the man’s erect
                            penis, visible in the Harvey loose pull and copy A, obscured in B and C,
                            and painted out in D.</p>

                            "faded noticeably since the facsimile of 1935 was

                            result of the photographic processes used, for the paper looks darker
                            and dirtier in this facimile than in the original.</p>
            <p>Pp. 324-32, Designs in the <hi rend="i">Notebook.</hi> Bentley follows

                            many, but not all, of the deleted emblem numbers recorded by Erdman. My
                            corrections noted here are based on a study of the original

            <p>P. 329, p. 63. Erdman’s facsimile records "43 <hi rend="i">del</hi> 45," not "[10 del] 15."

            <p>P. 329, p. 67. Erdman’s facsimile records
                            "41" for the deleted number, not
                            "48." I can’t make out the second digit at

            <p>P. 330, p. 73. The deleted number is 15, not "18." In
                            the inscription, the word is "perswade," not

                            looks nothing like "<hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> . . . pl.

                            tell which is right.</p>

            <p>P. 332, p. 114. Bentley overlooks the swirls on this page, perhaps

                            that there is some white line work (whether etched or engraved is hard
                            to tell in each case) on some <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> plates but
                            none in <hi rend="i">Experience.</hi> However, there is crude white line
                            work on a number of plates in <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>, most
                            apparent on the old man in "London" and the lower
                            trunk of the tree in "Human Abstract."</p>
            <p>P. 388, pl. 1. Leaves are around the "nude"
                            woman’s loins as well as the man’s.</p>
            <p>P. 389, pl. 4. The vignette upper right (as etched) shows a bird, not
                            "a standing man." In copies Y and Z a standing figure
                            is painted in the lower right vignette.</p>
            <p>P. 393, pl. 18. How can we tell that the floating figure upper left is a
                            "man" and the figure lower right partly beneath the
                            plant is a "woman"? The first wears a flowing gown
                            like the "walking woman" beside her/him, and the
                            second looks no more feminine than the rising figure just above.</p>
            <p>P. 394, pl. 19. The adult leading the girls is very likely a female
                            matron, not a "man."</p>
            <p>P. 396, pl. 26. The lantern is in the watchman’s left hand,
                            not "fastened at the top" of his staff.</p>
            <p>P. 398, pl. 37. The <hi rend="i">falling</hi> snow is
                            "Black"—that is, the color in which the
                            plate is printed—but on the ground it is white.</p>
            <p>P. 399, pl. 39. The figure is not "wrapped round" by
                            the worm in all copies (for example, not in A, B, I, K, N, Z, AA).</p>
            <p>P. 400, pl. 42 variants. The pen &amp; ink addition in copy P is
                            "Formd," not "Formed." This
                            misspelling also appears on p. 388, line 5. The question mark after
                            "hand" in line 12 was also erased along with
                            "&amp; what."</p>
            <p>P. 401, pl. 46. How can we tell that the old man is
                            "blind"?</p>
            <p>P. 421, copy T. A previously untraced copy of "The Clod
                            &amp; the Pebble" now in my collection may have originally
                            been part of copy T.<ref target="n26" type="note">10</ref> The print now
                            in T is one of the color printed plates inserted to complete the copy.
                            Like the other hand tinted prints in T, my impression is printed in
                            terra-cotta orange with an orange pen &amp; ink framing line (6-7
                            mm. outside the plate) and number (32) upper right within the frame. The
                            number indicates that this is not a separate impression, and Bentley
                            lists no other copy of the book with similar frames and numbers lacking
                            pl. 32. <note id="n26"><hi rend="s">10</hi> This possibility was kindly

                            Blake’s plates except for pl. 29." There are several

            <p>This is a thorough revision of the similar section in Bentley &amp;
                            Nurmi, with several new titles, now all transcribed, giving much more
                            information on publication history, plate-size, plate inscriptions,
                            proofs, and other pertinent matters. Some of the books with plates
                            engraved by others after Blake’s designs are simply hand-made
                            reproductions of earlier engravings and thus should be categorized
                            somewhere between the first generation graphics, made from
                            Blake’s drawings, and modern photographic reproductions. For
                            example, the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> design in <hi rend="i">The
                                Seraph</hi> (no. 512) and the two <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> designs in
                            Hamilton’s <hi rend="i">English School</hi> (no. 463) are no
                            doubt copies of the plates engraved by Blake and Schiavonetti, not of
                            the drawings. Bentley has been selective in his choice of this type of
                            material, apparently including only metal-plate reproductions made
                            shortly after Blake’s death and excluding various
                            nineteenth-century wood engravings after Blake’s designs,
                            such as those in Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life</hi>, vol. 20
                            of <hi rend="i">Scribner’s Monthly</hi>, or
                            Chatto’s <hi rend="i">Treatise on Wood Engraving</hi>, which
                            are just as close to the originals in the number of reproductive steps.
                            On the other hand, the Virgil illustrations in Gilchrist’s
                                <hi rend="i">Life</hi> and the 1843 <hi rend="i">Athenaeum</hi> are
                            mentioned only in passing (p. 630) even though they were printed from
                            Blake’s original blocks. There is some minor inconsistency in
                            the way modern reprints are listed. For example, reproductions of the
                            complete Job series are given individual entry numbers, but
                            twentieth-century reproductions of Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> (including two lacking the text) are listed as editions
                            under the single <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> entry number.</p>
            <p>Corrections and additions follow. Some of the latter is previously
                            unrecorded information on Blake’s plates contained in vols.
                            II-III of <hi rend="i">William Blake: Book Illustrator</hi>, the
                            publication of which has been long delayed. One or two of the many
                            corrections I propose in Bentley’s transcriptions of
                            title-pages and plate inscriptions may be due to our inspection of
                            copies that do in fact differ. In most cases, however, I have checked
                            multiple copies, including some of those Bentley lists, and I doubt that
                            I am simply recording a host of variants. I have not been able to
                            compare Bentley’s information directly against the following

                            × 18 cm. and the inscriptions removed, probably in

                            remark, quoted by Bentley, "that the reduced-size plates were
                            also issued separately in a portfolio." Isn’t no.

                            on the print as Bentley implies. The plate was cut down for the 1787
                            (not first in the 1791) edition. I can find no differences between
                            second edition (1787) and third edition (1791) impressions that cannot
                            be accounted for by differences in inking, printing, and wear.</p>

                            "OR," "LELEGES" has but two Ls, and
                            there is a line break after "Charing-cross." In the

                            a small capital. Bentley comments that, "since pl. 2-3, 5-11,
                            22 signed with some variant of ‘Engraved by G:C:’
                            in Cumberland’s <hi rend="i">Thoughts on Outline</hi> (1796)
                            exhibit [like the <hi rend="i">Hafod</hi>] this eccentric, sinister
                            ‘g,’ it seems likely that Cumberland too used this
                            ‘g.’ (Otherwise, we must assume that Blake
                            lettered the plates signed ‘Engraved by
                            G:C:’)." I think it is very likely that Blake did
                            indeed do all the lettering for Cumberland on the <hi rend="i">Thoughts
                                on Outline</hi> plates. The inscriptions on the
                            "G:C:" plates not only have the leftward serif on the
                            "g," but all the letters are formed the same as on
                            Blake’s signed plates in <hi rend="i">Thoughts</hi> [compare
                            illus. 1 &amp; 2]. I doubt that Cumberland had any skill at writing
                            backwards—witness his difficulties with his "New
                            Mode of Printing"<ref target="n27" type="note">11</ref>—and thus had to have Blake do all the lettering for
                            him. It is of course possible that Blake engraved the lettering on the
                                <hi rend="i">Hafod</hi> map but not the map itself. <note id="n27"><hi rend="s">11</hi> See <hi rend="i">A New Review</hi> . . .

                            impressions of the published plates: pl. 16, a tinted drawing of the

                            "Cary’s Dante" are small capitals. In the
                            quoted letter to Linnell of 30 Dec. 1856, J. H. Chance mentions
                            "Two proofs of Emmaus." This is no doubt
                            Linnell’s mezzotint, <pb id="p11-189" n="189"/> "The

                            imprint dated 17 June 1839. "Proof" in
                            Chance’s letter may mean no more than
                            "impression."</p>
            <p>Pl. 1. The inscription is scratched on the plate in mirror-image writing,
                            and no doubt was intended for re-engraving right way round (i.e.,
                            reversed in the copper) before publication. Bentley states that
                            "there are proofs of each [Dante plate] in the BMPR,"
                            but I have found proofs of only three plates, the other four being
                            published states. None of the plates were completed before

                            quarter of the plate before trimming text pages. In B, there <hi rend="i">is</hi> a date on pl. 1 (same as in A).</p>
            <p>Pl. 6. Another proof is in the collection of Raymond Lister. These five
                            proofs, all lacking the same considerable amount of finishing lines in
                            the design, have various amounts of lettering from signatures only to
                            full inscriptions as published. In D, Bentley believes that the plates
                            (except for one additional illustration) "were evidently
                            commissioned and executed at the same time as those for the first
                            edition," presumably because the same dates appear on these
                            reduced plates. However, it seems to have been a common practice in the
                            eighteenth century to retain original imprint dates when reissuing the
                            same illustrations, even if they are printed from new copperplates. And
                            I doubt that even Joseph Johnson was prescient enough in 1791 to know
                            that he would be publishing an octavo edition of Darwin eight years

                            That the previously unidentified proof in the BMPR [illus. 3] was
                            intended for Bell’s Poets is certain because of the border
                            design; that it was to illustrate the Donne volume is somewhat less
                            certain. Another possibility is that it was meant for the first Milton
                            volume in the series; for the published plate therein, after
                            Mortimer’s design, has the same subject as this proof [illus.
                            4].</p>
            <p>Emlyn, <hi rend="i">Proposition</hi>, no. 452, pp. 550-51. Title of A:
                            line break after "FOR," semi-colon after
                            "CHARING CROSS," period after date. Bentley rejects
                            Gibson &amp; Minnick’s contention that the plate Blake
                            signed in 1781 was "reworked, rather than re-engraved
                            entirely" for the 1797 edition. I tend to agree with Gibson
                            &amp; Minnick. The differences in the feathers cited by Bentley can
                            be explained as the common practice of reworking areas that printed
                            weakly in earlier editions. Two bits of evidence suggest that
                            Blake’s plate was indeed reworked and cut down. A fragment of
                            a semi-circular measurement line (upper left) still appears on the plate
                            even though it no longer has any function. This can be most easily
                            exlained as an oversight in reworking the plate; it would be odd to
                            retain an unnecessary line on a new plate. More convincing evidence is
                            provided by five tiny dots. In the 1781 impressions, dots are clearly
                            visible in the exact centers of the four half-circles that terminate two
                            pad-like elements of the column’s base. These were no doubt
                            made by the fixed foot of the compass used to mechanically draw the
                            half-circles (yes, Blake <hi rend="i">did</hi> use compasses). On the
                            left end of the lower pad are two dots, probably made by the need to
                            replace the compass foot in a second position in order to get the
                            semi-circle right. All these dots—including the extra one
                            lower left in exactly the same place—also appear in the 1797
                            plate. An "accidental" (to borrow a bibliographic
                            term) of this sort is a far better indication that two impressions are
                            from the same copperplate than the "substantive"
                            elements of design which receive careful attention in reworking a
                            plate.</p>

                            the lineation follows the Bodleian copy. The BM and American Blake
                            Foundation copies differ in lineation. There is also an unillustrated
                            edition of 1786.</p>
            <p>Pl. 1. The BMPR has a proof before letters, with the face of the winged
                            figure visible rather than covered with hair, but I have never been able
                            to find "a sketch." There is a drawing by Stothard
                            illustrating <hi rend="i">Richard III</hi>, but it shows Richard tossing
                            on his bed in his tent and is totally unlike Blake’s plate.
                            In the W. E. Moss sale, Sotheby’s, 2 March 1937, lot 232,
                            were the "Original Sketches by Stothard, for the re-working of
                            the 3rd state" (?), and in his 1921 <hi rend="i">Bibliography</hi>, p. 226, Keynes records that
                            "Stothard’s original sketch for the design"
                            was then in Moss’s collection, but I have not been able to
                            locate any of these. Bentley notes that the plate was "touched
                            up" in the 1795 edition, but I believe wear and printing
                            differences can account for the variations.</p>

                            Blake’s plate appears in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and
                            Princeton copies of the 1790 edition and is thus the first state
                            published in a book. I have been able to find only two later states:
                            filled letters in most copies of the 1790 (A) edition and all copies
                            examined (about 15) of the undated Boydell edition (B); the
                            "restored" (perhaps "ruined" would
                            be more accurate) plate in Heath’s edition of 1822 (C). All
                            subsequent changes in this plate, probably printed more often than any
                            other engraving by Blake, can be attributed to excessive wear. The
                            impression in the 1965 portfolio (I) is a mere ghost of what began as
                            one of Blake’s finest reproductive prints.</p>

            <p>Bentley records Keynes’ objections to the attribution of these
                            plates to Blake. Erdman has also questioned it,<ref target="n33" type="note">17</ref> and one can only hope that Blake did not do

            <p>The corresponding section in Bentley &amp; Nurmi has been deepened
                            and extended. The emphasis is naturally on catalogues of
                            Blake’s writings, but Bentley has included most of the
                            important exhibition and sale catalogues devoted to Blake’s
                            pictorial art. One addition in this category would be the sale of Lady
                            Melchett’s collection, Christie’s, 9 Nov. 1971,
                            lots 71-79—the last auction catalogue to contain a
                            significant number of Blakes, including two <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi>
                            drawings. Bentley includes the Hoe sale catalogue of 1911 (Part II, nos.
                            452-55, and Part III, nos. 376-88, should also be referred to) but
                            overlooks the privately printed <hi rend="i">Catalogue of Books in
                                English Later than 1700, forming a portion of the Library of Robert

              </title>
            </head>
            <p>This Part is divided into three lists: six titles "Blake is
                            known to have owned" (edition unidentified), forty-four copies
                            of books owned by Blake, and ten "Books Owned by the Wrong
                            William Blake." The second list is appropriately conservative,
                            including only works with Blake’s name in the
                            subscribers’ list, or for which we have a copy inscribed by
                            him, or which we know that he owned (and which edition) from
                            Blake’s own writings. These principles of selection exclude
                            from all three lists a number of works that we know, from indirect
                            evidence, that Blake had read. His reference to Bryant in the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> and his own methods in
                            comparative mythology show familiarity with <hi rend="i">A New System,
                                or, an Analysis of Ancient Mythology.</hi> Apparently this is not
                            included in Bentley’s first list because there is no direct
                            evidence that Blake <hi rend="i">owned</hi> it. Law’s edition
                            of <hi rend="i">The Works of Jacob Behmen</hi> and Byron’s
                                <hi rend="i">Cain</hi>, both in Bentley &amp; Nurmi, also go
                            unmentioned here, presumably for similar reasons. It would be
                            interesting to have a full list of books (the Bible, Chaucer,
                            Shakespeare, Milton, Ossian—to name some of the more obvious
                            entries) that we can be reasonably sure Blake knew from the evidence of
                            his writings and the subjects of his designs.</p>
            <p>Bentley gives title-page transcriptions of most of the works in his main

            <p>A great many items have been added to the 1964 list in Bentley &amp;
                            Nurmi, and all authors are now included in the index. But there have
                            also been some eliminations. As Bentley explains in the general
                            Introduction, he has "omitted scores of entries which appear in
                                <hi rend="i">A Blake Bibliography</hi> (1964), normally because
                            closer inspection proved them either to be reviews [all excluded] or to
                            be substantially irrelevant to Blake" (p. 11). Some of these
                                <pb id="p11-197" n="197"/> omissions deserve listing because of
                            their importance, in spite of brevity, and these have been included in
                            the following list of corrections and additions. Bentley does include
                            some important books with only passing references to Blake, like
                            Ellmann’s <hi rend="i">Yeats: The Man and the Masks</hi>, but
                            does not list others if they contain less than a chapter on Blake. A few
                            significant works of this sort which I have encountered are included
                            below. I have not listed any items published since Bentley’s
                            terminal date of June 1974. I know of some of the newspaper articles
                            only through clippings without page numbers.</p>

            <p>I fear that the fit audience, though few, who have followed the entire
                            course of this review may come to two conclusions: (1)
                            Essick’s mind is pickled in trivia; (2) Bentley’s
                            book is seriously flawed. I hope I can disabuse you of the latter. A
                            book that lists over 3,000 items is bound to include some mistakes. The
                            ones that I have listed here are at worst simple errors in fact, limited
                            to individual entries, and in no way indicate flaws in
                            Bentley’s bibliographic principles or logic. My perspective,
                            as usual, has been that of the collector and chalcographer, interested
                            in minor bibliographic "points," rather than that of
                            the literary critic. I could fill even more pages than I have here with
                            a recitation of Bentley’s discoveries, corrections to
                            previously published bibliographies, and sound deductions about such
                            complexities as the printing sequence of the illuminated books. Sir
                            Geoffrey remains, in his ninetieth year, the King of Blake
                            bibliographers (and long may he reign!), but surely the author of <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> is the heir apparent.</p>

          <p>Friends and foes of Romanticism have always agreed on at least one thing: the
                        importance of a displaced, sublimated, or (to use T. E. Hulme’s
                        word) "spilt" religious sensibility as a quality of
                        Romantic art. Shelley may start out as an atheist, Blake as an iconoclast,
                        Turner as a godless naturalist, but we still feel that the work of all these
                        artists is inseparable from some form of religious quest, some attempt to
                        probe ultimate mysteries. One of the most difficult problems in the
                        interpretation of Romantic art has been to clarify the precise relation
                        between secular and sacred, supernatural and natural, the infinite and
                        finite which informs the work of particular artists. An easy way out of this
                        dilemma is to divide nineteenth century art into two antithetical columns
                        labelled "sacred" and "secular," give
                        them geographical locations ("Northern" and
                        "Southern"), and announce that you have revealed a
                        "new structure of the history of modern art": <q> The gist
                            of my ambitious argument is this: that there is an important alternate
                            reading of the history of modern art which might well supplement the
                            orthodox one that has as its almost exclusive locus Paris, from David
                            and Delacroix to Matisse and Picasso. My own reading is based . . . on
                            the impact of certain problems of modern cultural history, and most
                            particularly the religious dilemmas posed in the Romantic movement, upon
                            the combination of subject, feeling and structure shared by a long
                            tradition of artists working mainly in Northern Europe and the United
                            States. (Rosenblum, p. 7) </q> Robert Rosenblum is too sophisticated,
                        however, to think that this claim will pass unchallenged, and he carries the
                        art of the defensive preface to new heights, anticipating all the objections
                        a reviewer might make. He apologizes for "the many subtle and
                        perhaps unsubtle historical distortions I have had to make for the sake of
                        internal logic. Perhaps the most incautious of these is my far too
                        simple-minded polarization between French and non-French art, as if all
                        French painters were concerned primarily, if not exclusively, with
                        art-for-art’s sake, and all Northern European painters with its
                        opposite extremes" (8). Rosenblum even warns us against the
                        beguiling effect of his own prestige as an art historian, and of the Slade
                        Lectures out of which this book developed, by confessing that he will be
                        "deeply distressed . . . if my own structure of what I now see as a
                        cohesive tradition in modern art were to be codified by innocent readers
                        into a fixed historical truth" (8).</p>
          <p>These caveats should be taken very seriously by all readers, innocent or not,
                        and especially by unwary Blake scholars who will be delighted to see the
                        crucial position given to Blake in Rosenblum’s "cohesive
                        tradition." The fact is that it is neither cohesive nor a tradition
                        in any recognizably historical sense. The continuity of Northern Romantic
                        art which Rosenblum constructs is riddled with adventitious associations and
                        what Erwin Panofsky called
                        "pseudomorphoses"—"the accidental
                        appearance at different moments in the history of art of works whose close
                        formal analogies falsify the fact that their meaning is totally
                        different" (10). The Southern or "Parisian" or
                        "orthodox" tradition which provides Rosenblum with a handy
                        straw-man throughout is almost equally mysterious. Rosemblum tells us in his
                        preface that he has left the "secure foothills of facts"
                        for the "precarious summits of ideas" (7), and so he
                        evidently feels <pb id="p11-201" n="201"/> no obligation to show that the
                        alleged orthodox tradition actually exists; at least we are not graced with
                        a single footnote, a passing allusion to an author or title, or any other
                        mundane fact which might tell us where to find the case for this orthodox
                        tradition presented.</p>
          <p>Our confidence in the cohesiveness of the Paris-based
                        "secular" tradition is hardly reinforced when we turn back
                        to Rosenblum’s earlier (and better) <hi rend="i">Transformations
                            in Late Eighteenth Century Art</hi> to check his assessment of the
                        founding father of this tradition, Jacques-Louis David.
                        Rosenblum’s reading of the <hi rend="i">Death of Marat</hi> is
                        filled with the purple prose which, in his newest book, is transferred to
                        the Northern Romantics: <q> The somber and resonant void above the martyred
                            figure creates a supernatural aura that demands a religious silence; it
                            is the post-medieval painter’s equivalent of a gold
                            background. Similarly the Caravaggesque light emanating from a high and
                            invisible source, saturates the bloody scene with an immateriality that
                            metamophoses the victim of a sordid bathtub murder into an icon of a new
                            religion. (<hi rend="i">Transformations</hi>, 83) </q> How are we to
                        reconcile this reading of David with the supposedly secular, aesthetic,
                        realistic tradition that stems from him?</p>
          <p>Faced with this inconsistency, Rosenblum falls back on a secondary
                        distinction, arguing that, while a religious aura can be found in <hi rend="i">both</hi> Southern and Northern painting, "yet in the
                        Protestant North, far more than in the Catholic South, another kind of
                        translation from the sacred to the secular took place, one in which we feel
                        that the powers of the deity have somehow left the flesh-and-blood dramas of
                        Christian art and have penetrated, instead, the domain of
                        landscape" (17). The antithesis drawn here between Christian art
                        and landscape is both exaggerated (landscape had long been part of Christian
                        art) and beside the point. <hi rend="i">The Death of Marat</hi>,
                        Goya’s <hi rend="i">Third of May</hi> and Ingres’ <hi rend="i">Napoleon I on his Imperial
                        Throne</hi>—Rosenblum’s main examples of Southern
                        religious art—are not examples of the "flesh-and-blood
                        drama of Christian art"; they may echo Christian imagery but they
                        are not pieces of Christian art. If we assume that Rosenblum is claiming
                        less than he says here, and simply arguing that the distinction is between
                        Northern religious landscape and Southern religious <hi rend="i">figure</hi>
                        painting ("flesh-and-blood dramas," Christian or
                        otherwise), the problem is not eliminated. First, he will later argue that
                        the "powers of the deity," far from having "left
                        the flesh and blood dramas of Christian art" in Northern painting,
                        are renewed in precisely that format in the work of Blake and Runge. Second,
                        the implication that all Southern landscape tends to be secular, northern
                        religious, will be undermined countless times as the book develops.
                        Constable’s views of Salisbury Cathedral will be declared
                        "far too sunny in mood, far too picturesque in vantage point to
                        convey any transcendental message" (30), an assertion which
                        conflicts both with Rosenblum’s thesis about Northern religious
                        sentiment, and with all that we know about the actual intentions behind
                        Constable’s painting. (Constable’s religious attitudes
                        may be consulted in Basil Taylor’s <hi rend="i">Constable:
                            Paintings, Drawings, and Watercolors</hi>, London, 1973, pp. 26, 228,
                        and 221.) Certain landscapes by the southern-based Corot will be allowed to
                        have religious overtones, but they are "at the most . . . only
                        implicit," whereas the religious dimensions of
                        Friedrich’s landscapes will be pronounced
                        "explicit" (31). Yet elsewhere Rosenblum, borrowing from
                        M. H. Abrams, will argue that the ability to implicitly present sacred
                        feelings in the apparently secular domain is a crucial feature of the
                        "natural supernaturalism" he finds in Northern
                        Romanticism, and that the abandonment of explicit and traditional Christian
                        imagery (those "flesh and blood dramas" again) is
                        precisely what his new tradition is all about.</p>
          <p>The problem, it should be evident, is that Rosenblum’s simple
                        polarities cannot hold the full range or complexity of Romantic and
                        post-Romantic painting in any clear focus, and that he is forced repeatedly
                        to shift the grounds of his distinctions in the face of overwhelming
                        counter-evidence. Turner, for instance, is continually linked with Friedrich
                        as a fellow "Northern Protestant artist," though all the
                        evidence suggests that Turner was quite uninterested in the Friedrichian
                        brand of natural Christianity which grew up in eighteenth century Germany.
                        Contemporary accounts of Turner make it clear that he had, as Jack Lindsay
                        points out, a "total lack of interest in religion, as if it were
                        something so unimportant that he need not even indicate his blank
                        unconcern" (<hi rend="i">J. M. W. Turner—His Life and
                            Work</hi>, London, 1966, p. 35). Constable, whose "picturesque,
                        sunny" landscapes are pronounced incompatible with religious
                        feeling on one page, is restored to the Northern side of the equation on
                        another, when his treatment of nature is compared with
                        Gericault’s. The <hi rend="i">Raft of Medusa</hi> is seen as an
                        "anthropocentric" document, showing man dominating nature
                        (35), in contrast to Northern Romantics like Constable who depict the
                        "pathetic fallacy" in which human feelings are attributed
                        to nature. Laying aside the obvious objection that the pathetic fallacy is
                        an example of anthropocentrism, not an antithesis of it, we have to be a
                        little uneasy when Constable is employed as a secular contrast to the
                        religious Friedrich on page 30, and then is allied with him against the
                        secular French painters on page 37.</p>
          <p>Like most of the "great traditions" which have been foisted
                        on the arts, Rosenblum’s Northern Romantic tradition is
                        essentially a rhetorical device used to bolster a series of value
                        judgments—in this case a preference for any art that has
                        pretensions to the mystical, symbolic, mysterious, or portentous, and thus
                        provides an occasion for the metaphysical fireworks of critical profundity.
                        A brief tour of Rosenblum’s distinctions between southern and
                        northern art quickly reveals the thread of invidious comparisons. Southern
                        landscapes show us "nothing more than a cheerful prospect"
                        (66), a "casually observed experience" like that of a
                        "tourist holiday" (77). Northern landscapes, on the other
                        hand, are always full of "deep" implications of one kind
                        or another (except, of <pb id="p11-202" n="202"/> course, when the Northern
                        artist is working in a picturesque mode, which is probably about half the
                        time). There is "no temptation to read beyond" the surface
                        of Southern painting, unless, Rosenblum admits, it is for "some
                        statement about perception" (73)—presumably a lower kind
                        of message than the deep religious meanings of the Northerners. Northern
                        paintings of children reveal "primal forces" while
                        Southern examples of this genre are "sentimental and
                        prettified" (87-88). Southern art is described throughout as
                        "purely decorative, artificial, prosaic, earthbound, egotistical,
                        concerned only with particulars" (an assertion that is undermined
                        when Rosenblum contrasts the particularity of Van Gogh’s flower
                        paintings to the generality of the Impressionists). At its best, Southern
                        art is concerned with close observation and empirical fidelity (a claim
                        which could surely apply to Turner and Constable as well). Northern art, by
                        contrast, is never characterized as "merely" this or that;
                        it is an art which always gives us more than meets the eye, evoking floods
                        of glittering abstractions which, as Rosenblum admits in a refreshingly
                        humorous aside, always sound more convincing in German than English.</p>
          <p>Art history has always advanced, it seems, by grand syntheses or dialectical
                        schemes which are then eroded away after years of careful scholarly
                        investigation. Wölfflin’s distinctions between
                        painterly and linear in <hi rend="i">Principles of Art History</hi> are
                        perhaps the most famous example, and despite universal skepticism about his
                        distinctions, they survive everywhere in the practical criticism and
                        teaching of art. The question is, are Rosenblum’s categories of
                        Northern and Southern Romanticism useful as critical fictions in the same
                        measure as were Wölfflin’s? I think the answer must be
                        a resounding no. Rosenblum’s categories, unlike
                        Wölfflin’s, are never subjected to any criticism or
                        analysis, but are thrown out as if they were self-evident. They are not
                        firmly grounded in the concrete properties of the works of art under
                        scrutiny, or in the intentions of the artists, but proceed through a series
                        of "subtle and perhaps unsubtle historical distortions . . . for
                        the sake of internal logic" (8). Substitute the word
                        "rhetoric" for "logic" here and you get
                        the picture. Most important, Rosenblum’s distinctions do not
                        serve to differentiate two equally valid and often intermingling currents in
                        nineteenth century art, the complex dialectic between sacred and secular;
                        they emerge rather as thinly veiled attempts to elevate Northern art by
                        depreciating Southern. Perhaps this was inevitable in a book which set out
                        to change the balance of power in art history, and to assert the value of a
                        rival tradition. But neither the value or nature of that tradition is
                        well-served by invidious comparisons masquerading as reasoned
                        distinctions.</p>
          <p>It will be important for Blake scholars in particular to be wary of the
                        beguiling over-simplifications of Rosenblum’s thesis. Blake
                        emerges from isolation in this book (as he did on much surer grounds in
                        Rosenblum’s earlier book, <hi rend="i">Transformations in Late
                            Eighteenth Century Art</hi>), to take his place as a key figure in the
                        continuity of Romantic and Modern painting. This is heady wine for Blakeans
                        who are used to seeing their man on the sidelines of art history, but it
                        should be sipped with caution. Rosenblum’s understanding of Blake
                        is based on criticism which is anything but fresh (the only footnoted
                        scholarship is Anthony Blunt’s article on the <hi rend="i">Ancient of Days</hi> from 1938), and does little more than repeat the
                        standard half-truths about Blake being against reason, materialism,
                        mathematics, and in favor of imagination, spirit, and emotion. It is very
                        intriguing to suppose that Blake belongs to a tradition that goes through
                        Samuel Palmer to Van Gogh, but in the absence of any demonstration of
                        historical links (Rosenblum says not a word about the Pre-Raphaelites, an
                        astonishing omission) one must rest content with being intrigued, but
                        unconvinced. When Rosenblum does get down to specifics with Blake he
                        presents a far-fetched comparison with Barnett Newman on the grounds that
                        both of them "rebelled against geometry" (209). We are
                        told that "Blake’s <hi rend="i">Ancient of Days</hi>,
                        like his <hi rend="i">Newton</hi> of 1795, is in effect, an evil force,
                        imposing trivial clarity in a sublime universe" (210). Surely our
                        understanding of Blake has gotten beyond the naive allegorizing which sees
                        Newton and Urizen as either trivial or evil forces in Blake’s
                        universe. "Heroic folly" or "Sublime
                        Error" seem to be much more accurate descriptions of
                        Blake’s attitude toward the activities of these characters, and
                        the images of them which he created.</p>
          <p>It would be pleasant to conclude that Rosenblum is, like Urizen, a Heroic
                        Fool trying to reduce the world to two principles, and that he has conducted
                        what Harold Bloom would call a "strong misreading" of
                        Romantic and Modern art, killing off his symbolic father (the orthodox
                        tradition of Paris-based art history) in order to assert a new vision.
                        Unfortunately this is not the case. The father is never named or confronted
                        in any concrete way, and the misreadings are consistently weak. The main
                        value of this book is that is does provide an encyclopedic survey of a great
                        many artists, some of whom <hi rend="i">might</hi> belong to a continuous
                        tradition. In particular, it demonstrates that Friedrich’s
                        contribution to modern art is probably much greater than has been realized.
                        If Rosenblum had contented himself with documenting Friedrich’s
                        influence in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries he probably would have
                        produced a much sounder, if more cautious book. As a contribution to our
                        understanding of English Romantic art (and Blake in particular) in relation
                        to the modern tradition, it has much less to recommend it. The task of
                        clarifying the interaction of sacred and secular themes in Romantic and
                        Modern art remains to be done.</p>

          <p>An important development in Blake scholarship in recent years has been the
                        attention paid to the influence of Blake’s techniques as an
                        engraver and as a painter on his art. Raymond Lister’s <hi rend="i">Infernal Methods: A Study of William Blake’s Art
                            Techniques</hi> comes at the right moment to supply the necessary
                        synthesis of these studies. Mr. Lister is a British art historian who has
                        specialized in the Romantic period in Britain with particular emphasis on
                        engraving and etching. In the introduction to this book he states that he is
                        concentrating on Blake’s craftsmanship and avoiding discussion of
                        "subjects such as the symbolism of Blake’s colors . . .
                        the gestures and stances of his figures, of the relevance of his designs to
                        his ideas of contraries, and so on, deeming it of greater importance in the
                        present context to dwell on <hi rend="i">how</hi> rather than on <hi rend="i">why.</hi>" Mr. Lister’s motives in making
                        this statement become more obvious as he describes many of
                        Blake’s techniques and admits that there is no general agreement
                        on exactly how they were done. Some of the controversies are relatively
                        minor, such as the problem of whether Blake varnished his watercolors or
                        not, but some others, for example his creation of relief etching, are
                        crucial to the <hi rend="i">why</hi> of his art. Indeed Mr. Lister does not
                        avoid analyzing the effect of the techniques which Blake chose on his
                        style—such as the influence of the firm wiry kind of engraving he
                        learned from Basire on his conception of the "bounding
                        line." By and large, however, with his admirable British clarity of
                        expression, Lister does restrict himself to factual discussions of
                        Blake’s engraving and painting. And in truth it is exactly this
                        kind of dispassionate analysis that is needed more than ever in the present
                        climate of Blake scholarship. His discussion of Blake’s engraving
                        describes not only the techniques themselves but also their use from the
                        seventeenth century onward. He compares Blake’s techniques to
                        those of his contemporaries, Flaxman and Fuseli, and analyzes the effects of
                        the new engraving techniques of the late eighteenth century.</p>
          <p>Since engraving was Blake’s profession, Lister, like most other
                        writers on Blake’s techniques, assumes that Blake was more than
                        just conversant with the different techniques of wood engraving, aquatint
                        and so on, even if he did not use them very often. Lister acknowledges that
                        the same cannot be said for Blake’s painting techniques, and he
                        quotes Gilchrist’s remarks that " . . . In an era of
                        academies, associations and combined efforts we have in him a solitary
                        self-taught and as an artist semi-taught dreamer. . . . " Lister
                        does, however, quarrel with Gilchrist’s use of the word
                        "dreamer," again emphasizing that a craftsman even in
                        another medium would be more of a realist in his use of different techniques
                        than the word might imply. Blake’s use of so-called
                        "fresco painting," for example, cannot be equated with any
                        known practice exactly and can only be labeled experimental. Yet in its way,
                        as Lister points out, it is totally competent and realized.</p>
          <p>He suggests much the same conclusion in his chapter on Blake’s
                        relief etching. My only quarrel with Lister, in this respect, is that he
                        sides with Ruthven Todd, Stanley William Hayter and Joan Miro in their
                        solution to the problem of how Blake’s relief etching was really
                        achieved. He states his agreement with them without referring to other and
                        more current solutions. Even though his book was published in 1975, he does
                        not mention the ideas put forth in many of the essays in Robert
                        Essick’s collection <hi rend="i">The Visionary Hand</hi> of 1973
                        nor in the essay in the 1973 <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi> by John
                        Wright, nor does he suggest that it is an area of scholarly controversy.<ref target="n35" type="note">1</ref><note id="n35"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Robert Essick "Blake and the
                            Traditions of Reproductive Engraving" in <hi rend="i">The

          <p>Lister does not, in fact, digress very often from his straightforward
                        accounting of the often extremely <pb id="p11-204" n="204"/> complicated
                        techniques of painting and printmaking of this period. Therein, in my
                        opinion, is one of the great virtues of this book. I see its almost
                        recipe-like simplicity as an antidote to the intense and subjective approach
                        of the literary scholar to Blake’s imagery. As the German art
                        historian Detlef Dörrbecker suggests in the 1977 summer issue of
                            <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> in his review of the David Bindman catalogue of
                        the Blake exhibition in Hamburg in 1975, art historians have only very
                        recently decided to deal to any great degree with the problem of form in
                        Blake. In the past with the exception of Sir Anthony Blunt and a few others,
                        literary scholars, as Dörrbecker notes, " . . . <hi rend="i">used</hi> Blake’s illuminations and paintings
                        because of their explanatory value as a kind of visual commentary or
                        complementary code for understanding his poetic creation. . . ."
                        Now he is confident that the idea that Blake’s work as an
                        engraver and painter is much more than a literal translation of his writing
                        must finally be taken seriously, and that more attention should and will be
                        paid the special visual qualities of Blake’s art. As a result the
                        new attention to form will have a salutary influence on our knowledge of the
                        iconographical content of Blake’s designs.<ref target="n36" type="note">2</ref> I am not quite so confident that the unique
                        character of Blake’s formes as separate in some respects from his
                        ideas is as generally accepted as Dörrbecker would like.
                        Certainly the recent interest in Blake’s relief etchings as a
                        problem which has many different kinds of implications is a symptom of this
                        interest. Even here, however, in the mechanical descriptions of the
                        process—where one would think that the literary scholar would be
                        held to the physical facts of the process—there are still many
                        areas of misunderstanding and ignorance. These in turn often result in
                        tortured and arcane interpretations which are fully as obscure as the most
                        complicated iconographical studies. Over and over reviewers and scholars
                        stumble on the most elementary problems without realizing the implications
                        of the use of this or that technique. Recently, in the 1977 spring issue of
                        the <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi> Tom Dargan criticized J. Wittreich
                        for calling crosshatching "a net of self-hood" and for
                        implying that Blake had used it for subjective interpretive reasons and not
                        as Mr. Dargan points out "because crosshatching is the
                        engraver’s usual method of giving body to the outlined
                        figure." At the same time, neither writer notes, in this regard,
                        Blake’s preoccupation with nets <hi rend="i">per se.</hi> Robert
                        Essick in his article "The Traditions of Reproductive
                        Engraving" of 1972<ref target="n37" type="note">3</ref>
                        demonstrates quite plainly that the new net-like conventions of engraving
                        resulted not only in images of webs and nets in Blake’s poetry
                        but, in his designs themselves, human forms covered with nets.<ref target="n38" type="note">4</ref> More often Blake’s
                        experiments with techniques are treated as individual and unique
                        expressions. Because there is very little understanding of the conventions
                        and <hi rend="i">schemata</hi> which the artist used unselfconsciously,
                        Blake’s techniques are often freighted with a meaning which is
                        controversial as well as all but incomprehensible except to the initiate.
                        For example, John Wright’s conclusion on the impulses which
                        caused Blake to use relief engraving—as being " . . .
                        the stages of process and cosmography of his sculptural plates, an analogue
                        or emblem of the layered structure of the hierarchic allegorical systems of
                        the cultural world he sought to anatomize and to represent by
                        transfiguration" is an extreme example. Could it not have been just
                        as much, as Lister, Robert Essick and others have pointed out, a part of the
                        general tendency to experiment with techniques of all kinds in the late
                        eighteenth century in England rather than a deliberately conscious synthesis
                        with poetic hierarchies? <note id="n36"><hi rend="s">2</hi> It is a curious
                            fact but literary scholars appear to find iconography more attractive
                            than the study of technique. One wonders why this is so. It may be that
                            it generally resembles literary history. Unfortunately art historical
                            methodology is as various as literary criticism, and while a literary
                            scholar would never use structuralist and Marxist methodology in the
                            same work, he often does not see that the same differences operate in
                            art history. In other words, until now, no one has as yet mastered both
                            disciplines well enough to use them both with ease.</note><note id="n37"><hi rend="s">3</hi> Robert Essick’s article was

          <p>Mr. Lister’s reasoned clarity, rather than intuition and
                        interpretation—no matter how brilliant—should be the
                        basis for further discussion of Blake’s technique and the
                        influence of this technique on his visual imagery. It is more important at
                        this stage to know what Blake did, how he did it, how his techniques fit
                        into the general artistic situation, than to view his formal experiments
                        solely in connection with his poetry. This may seem like heresy to some and
                        yet the best art historical work of recent years, Bo Lindberg’s
                            <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Illustrations to the Book of
                            Job</hi>, includes a whole chapter on the techniques used and their
                        effect on the imagery of this one work alone. After all, Blake, no matter
                        how experimental and eccentric, must have assumed that his works would be
                        viewed in a certain way. His craftsmanship by itself would have had control
                        over many of the effects he attempted; they could not have been the result
                        of sudden inspiration. Lister, for example, indicates that the difference in
                        the time taken for hand coloring those plates colored by Blake and his wife
                        Catharine together and those colored by Blake alone, which took more time
                        and were done with more detail, resulted in appreciable visual
                        differences.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, rather than being the result of some poetic idea, the very
                        notion of hand coloring—of "fresco" painting,
                        of recreating tempera effects—is part and parcel of the
                        experimental British taste of the time, a taste which was often deliberately
                            anachronistic.<ref target="n39" type="note">5</ref> One can compare Sir
                        Joshua Reynolds (whom Blake despised) and his use of asphaltum to achieve
                        "Rembrandtian" effects with Blake’s techniques
                        of painting and engraving in which he wished to recreate
                        "Gothic" effects. In fact, as Thomas Hess remarked in his
                        recent review of the newly opened Yale Center for British Art,
                        "English painting is apt to be technically corrupt. The artists
                        liked eclectic mixtures of texture and illumination."<ref target="n40" type="note">6</ref> British artists tended also, unlike
                        their peers on the continent (whose long indoctrination into the hierarchy
                        of <hi rend="i">genres</hi> more or less restricted experimentation to the
                        separate medium), to wander from one technique to another. The English
                        desire to achieve the brightness and clarity of illumination or fresco,
                        while part of the early nineteenth century longing for the
                        "simplicity" and "purity" of the <hi rend="i">Quattrocento</hi>, took forms as different as Samuel
                        Palmer’s use of body-color and later the "wet
                        white" ground of the Pre-Raphaelites.<ref target="n41" type="note">7</ref> In this connection Blake, rather than being outside the stream
                        of tradition as he is so often depicted in histories of painting, is at the
                        very center of what was to become the overriding preoccupation of the
                        nineteenth century artist—the concentration on
                        process—on how the work of art was made and the relationship of
                        this process to the content of the work. <note id="n39"><hi rend="s">5</hi> Duncan MacMillan in his review of David
                                Erdman’s <hi rend="i">The Illuminated Blake</hi> and
                                Raymond Lister’s <hi rend="i">Infernal Methods</hi> in
                                the <hi rend="i">Apollo</hi>, August, 1976, points out that there
                                was another engraver, Joseph Strutt, who was interested in
                                illuminated manuscripts and "Gothic" effects at
                                the same period that Blake was also interested in these things. He
                                states: <q> The world of the London engraver was small, but even if
                                    no direct link can be established between Strutt and Blake, his
                                    example is important. By showing that Blake was not isolated in
                                    his enthusiasm for illuminated manuscripts does not make his use
                                    of them any less original but by making it seem less
                                    unprecedented it makes the logic of his choice of art forms
                                    apparent. </q></note><note id="n40"><hi rend="s">6</hi> Thomas Hess, "English Artists,

          <p>While it is probable that art historians and literary scholars will never
                        view Blake’s dual creative processes in exactly the same way, it
                        seems logical that such studies as Lister’s <hi rend="i">Infernal
                            Methods</hi> should be read as the first step in understanding
                        Blake’s visual imagery. It is, as I mentioned before, especially
                        useful because it does not try to be interpretive in a literary or
                        philosophical way. As literary scholars such as Robert Essick and others
                        have already realized, iconography, which is just as dense and impenetrable
                        in its way as textual analysis, may not be as useful as an initial response
                        to Blake’s imagery as the study of technique and its relationship
                        to form. To understand the medium, its norms and the experiments that Blake
                        made with these norms might enable us to take the first step toward the
                        " . . . more than meets the eye." It might even be the
                        essential bridge between the two areas of Blake scholarship.</p>
          <p>A reviewer must pity the author of a Twayne volume—the
                        restrictions of which apparently make the writing of an intelligent and
                        meaningful book on Blake difficult. I must assume that Victor Paananen has
                        done his best, having accepted willingly the limitations of the Twayne
                        format. Unfortunately, however, the final result is a near disaster that is
                        redeemed from absolute failure only by Paananen’s understanding
                        that he is not writing about a mythological poet but a prophet who tried to
                        dramatize mental strife and not to create another rattletrap pantheon of
                        bloated gods and goddesses. The Twayne <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, however,
                        cannot be taken seriously as a contribution to the study of Blake. It is, in
                        fact, not even a good introduction and fares poorly when compared to Max
                        Plowman’s fifty-year old critique, which, by the way, is not
                        listed in the selected bibliography; nor are Swinburne, Yeats, Symons,
                        Wicksteed, or Percival. The usual Twayne restriction on the number of
                        entries in selected bibliographies will not explain Paananen’s
                        astounding omissions, especially considering some of the items included. But
                        "we" (Paananen’s favorite personal pronoun,
                        which makes him sound repeatedly like Charles Lindbergh in Paris), does not
                        compliment the dead, since, "we" may suppose, they have no
                        influence on the careers of the living. <pb id="p11-206" n="206"/> It would
                        be possible to list at random fifty articles of more worth than the Twayne
                            <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, half of which might well have been included
                        either in the bibliography <hi rend="i">or</hi> in the notes. But with
                        Yeats, Wicksteed, and Percival missing (from the notes, too), what else can
                        be said.</p>
          <p>In his preface Paananen suggests that serious Blake scholarship makes it
                        possible for "a book like this one [to be] written with fewer
                        trepidations." Fewer trepidations than what? (Aside from regretting
                        the incomplete comparison, I still wonder why. I should imagine it would be
                        the other way around, that is, since it was decided to publish the book at
                        all.) He assures the reader that "Specialized work can now be
                        carried forward confidently" because of that serious scholarship
                        about which he speaks. Very nice, very nice, but Twayne and Paananen should
                        have helped. Needless to say, they did not. The reader is also informed that
                        "Because of Blake’s reputation for obscurity,"
                        Paananen will make "extensive use of quotation [he overdoes it]
                        both to explicate the lines [there is very little true explication] and to
                        demonstrate that Blake can speak very well for himself." Believe it
                        or not, Paananen actually does write that "Blake can speak very
                        well for himself." Aside from the silliness of such a remark, which
                        even a Twayne book ought to avoid, Paananen calls attention to one of the
                        book’s greatest weaknesses. Not serious scholarship itself, the
                        Twayne <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> does a poor job of introducing Blake,
                        especially to the neophyte reader, the only kind of reader for whom a Twayne
                        book has any value. The author must explain and illuminate, not just quote.
                        His description of Blake’s method of illuminated printing, for
                        example, is incomplete, incorrect, and unclear. It is certainly of no use to
                        anyone as an explanation. The reader gets the impression that Blake and
                        Blake’s ideas have literally sprung from nowhere. He is given
                        some names, but no relations are established. The discussion of
                        "outline" is a case in point. There is no mention of
                        Michelangelo or Raphael. In fact, they are nowhere mentioned in the book.
                        Neither are a host of others who contributed to Blake’s
                        intellectual milieu.</p>
          <p>The Twayne <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> begins with a skimpy and wholly inadequate
                        biographical survey. This is followed by a chapter on <hi rend="i">There is
                            No Natural Religion, All Religions are One</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The
                            Book of Urizen.</hi> The discussion of the three <hi rend="i">Religion</hi> plates could easily have been omitted, since Paananen
                        does not really explain them. The rest of the chapter is pedestrian at best
                        and fundamentally out of place. The third chapter on the <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> is a shallow pastiche of quotations and
                        superficial comments, but chapters four and five on <hi rend="i">The
                            Marriage of Heaven and Hell, The French Revolution</hi>, and <hi rend="i">America</hi> are even worse. <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> is
                        ignored as are Blake’s illustrations for his own work as well as
                        that of others.</p>
          <p>Paananen’s commentary interlaced by inexcusable gobs of quotation
                        is distantly descriptive at best. The reader gets little or no insight into
                        Blake’s work or how his mind works. The book’s four
                        pages (a chapter!) on the <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of
                            Albion</hi> are superficial and chapter seven on <hi rend="i">The Songs
                            of Innocence and of Experience, Thel</hi> and <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi>
                        fails in every respect to illuminate these poems. In trying unsuccessfully
                        to cover as much as he can, Paananen covers little. The book is poorly
                        organized and disjointed. The reader is never permitted to get hold of
                        anything on which to build even the foundations of an understanding of what
                        Blake is about. The piecemeal chronology, which Paananen violates at just
                        those times when he should not, is carried over to the chapter on <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> Instead of giving his reader a coherent
                        introduction to <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> as a whole, he resorts to
                        snippets (most of his chapters are snippets) on each of the nine nights.
                        Like the following chapter on the "Manuscript Poems"
                        (another pastiche of quotation), the chapter on <hi rend="i">The Four
                            Zoas</hi> is a superficial narrative concerned in turn with
                        Blake’s narrative, which Paananen tells us rightly and early in
                        the book is not the fundamental structure of a Blake
                        "epic." Would to God he had organized his book with this
                        understanding in the forefront of his mind. The chapters on <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> are not worthy of serious
                        discussion, and the "Conclusion" might have served as the
                        beginning of a truly well oriented introductory chapter, which the book
                        sorely needs.</p>
          <p>In his preface, Paananen somewhat pompously suggests that "Blake
                        scholars will no doubt dispute many of my [sic] readings of individual poems
                        and passages—many of the readings are indeed new—but
                        they will recognize that I am writing about the same William Blake that the
                        scholarship of the last fifty years has identified for us." Not
                        only is there nothing new to dispute (absolutely nothing),
                        "we" wonder why <hi rend="i">only</hi> fifty years and
                        where is the evidence that even that has been adequately researched by the
                        author. The absurdity of Paananen’s opinion of his book is
                        underscored by the book itself. The errors in interpretation and
                        over-simplifications that abound in it do not require a scholar’s
                        refutation.</p>
          <p>Paananen’s heart is, I suppose, in the right place. He likes Blake
                        and he appreciates the integrity of Blake’s work as a whole.
                        Furthermore, he says he understands that both the individual poem and the
                        individual plate each have an independent as well as an interdependent
                        being, although he seems not to have organized his material with this idea
                        in mind. Also, he stresses rightly Blake’s radical politics and
                        biblical evangelicalism, at least in general. But the book does not
                        particularize. It does not go deep. It is not well-written, well-organized,
                        or truly helpful as an introduction to Blake. And, finally, it is certainly
                        not a contribution to Blake studies. It will, I believe, serve no purpose at
                        all.</p>

          <p>During the two weeks from Saturday, 29 July to Saturday, 12 August 1978, the
                        Eighth Annual Wordsworth Summer Conference will be held at Grasmere, in the
                        English Lake District. According to Richard wordsworth, the Conference
                        Director, "Although the poetry of Wordsworth and Coleridge is
                        central to our discussions, . . . there is a great deal that would interest
                        Blake specialists too . . . David Erdman has been with us for the last two
                        years, and Horst Meller, of Heidelberg University, is another who has
                        lectured on William Blake." William Empson, Geoffrey Hartman,
                        Robert Langbaum, and Thomas McFarland were among last year’s
                        guest lecturers.</p>
          <p>The conference is residential. Accomodation is reserved in two hotels in
                        Grasmere village. There are lectures morning and evening, and a daily
                        seminar. In the afternoons and on weekends there is a program of excursions,
                        walks, and climbs of varying severity.</p>
          <p>The inclusive fee for the two weeks is $450, which covers accommodation at
                        the hotel, all meals, local transportation, and other expenses on all main
                        excursions, and attendance at all lectures and seminars. For further
