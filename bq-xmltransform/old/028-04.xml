        <p>After the purse-depleting 1993 auction season, Blake collectors deserved a respite in 1994. But did they really need this much serenity? Lovers of the illuminated books had to satisfy themselves with a recto/verso printing of two plates from proof copy c of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (illus. 1-2) and some posthumous pulls of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience.</hi> The only Blake drawings to come to market were decidedly minor (illus. 3). Significant separate plates failed to appear. Indeed, genuine Blakes were hardly more interesting than the odd bits of Blakeana that changed hands (illus. 6-12, 17). The most important 1994 sale catalogue devoted principally to Blake was the “William Blake 1757-1827” list of 41 items issued by Adam Mills Rare Books in November. Among the 10 works with engravings by or after Blake (all listed below) was Bürger’s <hi rend="i">Leonora</hi> (1796), a very rare title decently offered at £950. Prices for standard items continued to drift sideways. Among letterpress books with Blake’s engravings, only the rarest and more desirable titles—Cumberland’s <hi rend="i">Attempt to Describe Hafod, Remember Me!</hi>, Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> in good condition—have been able to command new highs. In the last three years, sets of the Dante engravings have come on the market with too much frequency to sustain the prices they fetched five years ago.</p>
        <p>The great auction of Frank Rinder’s Blake collection in late November 1993 (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 27 [1994]: 104-17) resulted in record-setting prices for Blake’s finest prints. Like some politicians who will remain nameless here, this landmark sale seems to have had no coattails—that is, the lower ranges of the Blake market were not boosted by the prices fetched at the market’s upper end. This point was firmly made by the attempt to sell four Blake Trust facsimiles, all in the special-edition format with production materials added, at Christie’s East (New York) on 20 April 1994. None sold, in spite of reasonable estimates.</p>
        <p>It has become increasingly clear that the Blake market has two, perhaps even three, tiers. There are a few, very wealthy folk at the upper reaches who buy nothing but the most visually impressive original water colors or prints. Next are collectors who can afford books with Blake’s commercial illustrations and everything below—facsimiles, editions, criticism, etc. Finally there are the scholars and students who can manage everything up to a Blake Trust facsimile, but never indulge in original works. There would seem to be only two or three collectors who cover the full range, from drawings and illuminated prints to postcards. Thus, what happens at the very top end of the market has virtually no effect at the two lower levels. The widening gap between rich and poor—a worldwide phenomenon—seems also at work in the Blake marketplace.</p>

        <p>The year of all sales and catalogues in the following lists is 1994 unless indicated otherwise. The auction houses add their purchaser’s surcharge to the hammer price in their price lists. These net amounts are given here, following the official price lists. The value-added tax levied against the buyers’ surcharge in England is not included. I am grateful for help in compiling this review to G. E. Bentley, Jr., Sidney Berger, David Bindman, Betsy Bowden, Peter Briscoe, Michael Campbell, Paul Csank, Detlef Dörrbecker, Richard Godfrey, Thomas V. Lange (the source for more of the book listings than I care to admit), Nicolas Lott (the leading Blakean among print dealers), Jane Munro, Justin Schiller, Maurice Sendak, Jessica Smith, Stephen Somerville, John Steadman, Joseph Viscomi, David Weinglass, John Windle (the leading Blakean among book dealers), and Andrew Wyld. Once again, Patricia Neill’s editorial assistance and photography by Robert Schlosser and John Sullivan have been invaluable.</p>

          <head>2. <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, pl. 17 (23.3 × 16.5 cm.), 1st st. of 3 from proof copy c (designated in Bentley as impression 17<hi rend="s">c</hi>).</head>
          <figDesc>Gray-blue ink on the verso of pl. 11 (illus. 1). Etching borders wiped clean of ink. The remains of old cellophane tape mar each corner. The plate is not perfectly registered with its recto companion; but what would be the inner margins in a bound volume accord very closely and the general compatibility between recto and verso, given the differences in plate size, is as good as in many complete illuminated books sold by Blake. There are 5 recorded sheets with pl. 11 on the recto and pl. 17 on the verso, all printed in black, blue-gray, or greenish ink on sturdy Whatman-type (or perhaps I Taylor) wove paper. The registration of the plates, the wiping of the etching borders, and the number of such recto/verso impressions suggest that they are not true working proofs but part of a first print run, before the two-step revisions to pl. 17, that may represent an early version of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> in which 11 and 17 were consecutive plates. This possibility was first explored in regard to copy a (British Museum) in A. W. J. Lincoln, “Blake’s ‘Europe’: An Early Version,” <hi rend="i">Notes and Queries</hi> 223 (1978): 213.</figDesc>

Butlin suggests that the head of Adam “bears a remarkable likeness to Blake himself” and states that “both sides of the drawing were at one time obscured by having other drawings, apparently copies after Francis Barlow, stuck to them” (#814). Reportedly offered, from the estate of George Hooper, to various London art dealers by no later than April 1994; still

available Dec. 1994 through Campbell Fine Art. In <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 16 (1982): 61, I expressed doubts about the attribution of these drawings, particularly the <hi rend="i">Adam</hi>, to Blake and suggested an alternative attribution to the Linnell family. I know of no other drawings by Blake executed in such soft chalk lines with rudimentary shading. Linnell was much involved in copying Michelangelo in the late 1820s and early 1830s; he engraved single figures from the Sistine ceiling frescos in 1828 and the full “Creation of Adam” panel in 1833. It would have been unusual even for the Linnells to cover a genuine Blake by sticking other drawings to it, whereas sketched copies—after Barlow, Michelangelo, Blake, or whomever—by members of the family are more likely to be treated in such cavalier fashion. I have not seen this drawing and can add nothing further to my earlier suspicions.</p>

Not all the labels on off-white paper were used, and thus there would have been no obvious reason for a reprint on pink stock.</p>

            <p>A note on bindings: The astute book dealer John Windle tells me that he has seen a copy of the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> in gray-brown boards with off-white endpapers, typical of original boards used in the 1790s. Both Windle and Thomas Lange are suspicious that the blue boards of the Sims Reed copy, described above, are later—perhaps an 1830s reissue of sheets printed in 1797. This theory accords with the fact that at least one copy of the book, sold CL, 7 Dec. 1988, #120 (Traylen, £3080), contains an “Explanation” leaf showing an 1833 watermark.</p>

If the signature in a copy owned by Charles Feinberg (see Bentley 685) is right, then Blake seems to have owned a copy of this book. Unfortunately, the lawyer William Blake, active c. 1800-10, has a signature convincingly like our artist’s. Thus, I’m hesitant to accept without suspicion that Blake owned a book when the evidence rests solely on a signature.</p>

Blake engraved the same views of the vase for Erasmus Darwin’s <hi rend="i">Botanic Garden</hi>, first published by Joseph Johnson in 1791. On 9 July 1791, Darwin wrote Josiah Wedgwood that “Mr. Johnson’s engraver [i.e., Blake] now wishes much to see Bartolozzi’s plates of the vase, &amp; will engrave them again if necessary—I told Johnson in my own name, <hi rend="i">not in yours</hi>, that I thought the outlines too hard, &amp; in some places not agreeable” (G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Records Supplement</hi> [Oxford: Clarendon P, 1988] 10). On 23 July 1791, Johnson wrote Darwin that “Blake is certainly capable of making an exact copy of the vase, I believe more so than Mr. B[artolozzi], if the vase were lent him for that purpose . . .” (Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> [Oxford: Clarendon P, 1969] 43-44).</p>

Adam and Eve stand beside the font’s shaft, shaped to represent the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil with the serpent coiled around the trunk. The bas-relief on the side of the bowl pictures the baptism of Christ. The vignettes right and left show the bowl’s other bas-reliefs: Noah’s ark with the dove bearing “an olive leaf pluckt off” (Genesis 8:11), and St. Philip the Evangelist baptizing “an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians” (Acts 8:27; see 8:38 for the event pictured).</figDesc>

Withrow, “The Chimney-Sweep in American Verse,” <hi rend="i">Notes &amp; Queries</hi> 160 (1931): 98, “The Little Sweep,” pp. [35]-36 in Knight’s volume, “immediately suggests Blake[’s]” two chimney-sweeper poems. The rhythm of Knight’s poem does not follow Blake’s, but there are a few similarities in imagery between “The Chimney Sweeper” in <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> and “The Little Sweep.” Knight literalizes and racializes Blake’s “little black thing” into a “little Afric Sweep” named “Sampo”; the sweeper’s blackness is contrasted to the “snow” in both poems. I can find no letterpress printing of either of Blake’s chimney-sweeper poems prior to 1824, there seems to have been no copy of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence Innocence</hi> or <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> in America before 1809, and Knight never visited England (according to Withrow and the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of American Biography</hi>).

<figure><head>9. Cover design for “The Divine Vision[:] Blake’s Illustrations to the Book of Job.”</head><figDesc>Pen and black ink, touches of white, 36.1 × 26.8 cm. Essick collection. Perhaps an early title page or cover design for Joseph Wicksteed, <hi rend="i">Blake’s Vision of the Book of Job</hi> (London: Dent, 1910), executed when the book’s title and its emphasis on the author’s critical text (rather than on reproductions of Blake’s designs) had not yet been determined. However, the fact that this drawing is so much larger than Wicksteed’s book supports the alternative theory that this is a title page, cover, or dustjacket design for a different publication, one meant to reproduce Blake’s Job engravings, full-size or larger, with an introductory essay by Wicksteed. I know of no such reproduction of the Job designs; the volume of full-size Job reproductions published by J. M. Dent &amp; Co. in 1902 does not include a title page or any contribution from Wicksteed. An accompanying pen and black ink drawing, 29.8 × 3.2 cm., is probably for the spine of the same volume. Its text reads “The Book of Job” and, at the foot, “J.M Dent &amp; Co.”</figDesc></figure>

                <figDesc>Pencil, brush, black ink and black crayon heightened with white, 19 × 27 cm., datable to 1917. Huntington Library and Art Gallery. Blind Tiriel seeks “his pathless way.” In a letter to Gordon Bottomley of 28 Sept. 1917, Nash wrote that he had “just finished two designs for Blake’s poem <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi>—” (quoted in Andrew Causey, <hi rend="i">Paul Nash</hi> [Oxford: Clarendon P, 1980] 62-3). He completed at least one further design, <hi rend="i">The Howling Maiden led her Father</hi>—(Causey 359, locating the work in the collection of Timothy Andreae). In a letter of Oct. 1917 to John Drinkwater, Nash notes that “the fourth drawing for Tiriel is designed and half carried out” (Causey 359), but nothing further is known of this work. As far as I can determine, none of the drawings was ever published in an edition of <hi rend="i">Tiriel.</hi> In his autobiography, Nash states that he saw Blake’s own <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> illustration, <hi rend="i">Har and Heva Bathing</hi> (Butlin #198.2), at the home of Edward Marsh, who acquired the work in 1904 (Nash, <hi rend="i">Outline: An Autobiography and Other Writings</hi> [London: Faber, 1949] 137). Perhaps it was this experience, rather than a commission from a publisher or patron, that inspired Nash to attempt his own series of drawings for the poem. See also illus. 11.</figDesc>

I have always felt very grateful to you for the kind trouble you took in bringing my article on ‘Mr. Butts, the Friend &amp; Patron of Blake’ before the notice of the Editor of the Connoisseur’ and it will give me great pleasure if you will accept the enclosed engraving in remembrance of it. I recollect you told me y[ou] are delighted in Blake &amp; it was under his tuition, probably from one of his designs that this was executed, though we may hope that it was Mr. Butts who is responsible for the faulty drawing of the features. It was given to me some years ago by my late brother-in-law Captain Butts [grandson of Blake’s patron Thomas Butts, Sr.].<lb/>
Hoping that this may prove of some little interest to you.
</q>
Blake instructed Thomas Butts, Jr., in engraving between 1806 and 1808. According to Briggs’s essay to which she refers in the letter quoted above, “the father seems to have profited far more by the lessons than the son did, and though it is difficult, when father and son both have the same name, to be sure in every case, the drawings and engravings reproduced here are all believed to be by the father” (“Mr. Butts, The Friend and Patron of Blake,” <hi rend="i">Connoisseur</hi> 19 [Sept.-Dec. 1908]: 92-96, quotation from 93, this pl.—perhaps this impression—illus. 96). The only other impressions known to me are 2 in the Keynes Collection, Fitzwilliam Museum, and a modern restrike kept with the copperplate in the Rosenwald Collection.</figDesc>

                <figDesc>Pen and ink, 5.9 × 14.2 cm., c. 1800. Essick collection. A preliminary drawing for Blake’s engraving in Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Essay on Sculpture</hi> (see illus. 14). On the plate, the design is attributed to Thomas Hayley, William Hayley’s son and a student of Flaxman’s. The existence of this drawing, attributable to Flaxman on stylistic grounds, suggests that the true designer of the image was the master, not the apprentice. Perhaps the attribution to Tom Hayley was made to please his father. An ink drawing of the design close to the size of the plate and with the background motifs, probably by the younger Hayley but perhaps touched up by Flaxman, is in the Keynes Collection, Fitzwilliam Museum. There is also a rough pencil sketch of the image, 14.7 × 19.1 cm., in the Rosenwald Collection, National Gallery of Art, Washington.</figDesc>

                <figDesc>Essick collection. Inscribed in pencil below the design in an unknown hand, “This relates to Stothard and Blake who went on a sketching ramble and while there situated near Upnor Castle on the Medway were taken Prisoners as spies and detained by the garrison till they heard from London the truth of their story.” This inscription is very probably based on the description of the incident in Mrs. [A. E.] Bray, <hi rend="i">Life of Thomas Stothard, R.A.</hi> (London: John Murray, 1851) 20-21. Bray was also the first to attribute the etching to Stothard and identify the figures, although which figure is which in the design is uncertain. Equally unclear is the relation between the image—three leisurely fellows on a camping trip—and a narrative about imprisonment. Where is the “sentinel” mentioned by Bray? G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1969) 19n3, reasons that the most likely date of the events pictured is September of 1780 or 1781. In addition to this previously unrecorded example, there are impressions in the Rosenwald Collection, National Gallery of Art, with a pencil inscription relating a different version of the incident (formerly A. E. Moss collection, reproduced in Geoffrey Keynes, <hi rend="i">A Bibliography of William Blake</hi> [New York: Grolier Club, 1921] facing 326, and Keynes, <hi rend="i">The Complete Portraiture of William &amp; Catherine Blake</hi> [London: Trianon Press for the Blake Trust, 1977] pl. 2); Balmanno Collection, British Museum (apparently the print reproduced, much reduced, in Bray 20); another in the British Museum; and one recently discovered by Jane Munro in an album of drawings and prints by Stothard from the collection of George Cumberland, acquired by the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. My thanks to G. E. Bentley, Jr., for assistance in deciphering the pencil inscription on the impression reproduced.</figDesc>

                <p>The original is the signed drawing on the right (illus. 8); the copy is on the left (illus. 7). Both represent <hi rend="i">Christ’s Troubled Dream</hi> from Milton’s <hi rend="i">Paradise Regained.</hi> The original is pen and water color over pencil, 16.4 × 13.2 cm., c. 1816-20 (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge). The copy is pen and water color, 16.4 × 13.2 cm. (Essick collection). In 1913, this facsimile was lent by “the Linnell Trustees” to the National Gallery [of] British Art (now Tate Gallery), #53 in the <hi rend="i">Catalogue of Loan Exhibition of Works by William Blake</hi> [ed. A. G. B. Russell], 2nd ed. (London: Stationery Office, 1913) 41. There the work is attributed to “J. T. Linnell” (James Thomas Linnell, born 1823, the son of Blake’s friend, patron, and fellow artist John Linnell) and said to be part of a “complete set of copies . . . from Blake’s [12] designs for <hi rend="i">Paradise Regained.</hi>” The hand-painted reproduction of <hi rend="i">Christ’s Troubled Dream</hi> was placed in the exhibit side by side with the original, much as with the photo reproductions here.</p>
                <p>Six of the Linnell facsimiles, all lacking the “Blake” signature of the originals, are now in the Essick collection: <hi rend="i">The First Temptation, Mary at Her Distaff Watched over by Two Angels, The Second Temptation, Christ’s Troubled Dream, Morning Chasing Away the Phantoms</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The Third Temptation</hi> (corresponding to Butlin #544.2, 4, 7-10). One other, probably <hi rend="i">Christ Refusing the Banquet Offered by Satan</hi> (a copy of Butlin #544.6), was entitled “Satan Tempting Christ” and offered for sale for £10. 10s. by the London dealer T. H. Robinson in his cat. 68 of 1939, #10, attributed to John Linnell and said to be from the collection of John Linnell, Jr. (born 1821). This work was acquired by Chauncey B. Tinker, according to Butlin 1:401. All 6 drawings in my collection would appear to be on the same paper; the sheet bearing <hi rend="i">The Second Temptation</hi> (a copy of Butlin #544.7) shows a watermark, “1801/E &amp; P.” Thus, the paper of these copies is 15 years older than the originals, 3 of which show an “M &amp; J LAY 1816” watermark. Blake used E &amp; P (Edmeads and Pine) paper for several of his illuminated books, but Bentley 71 records none dated 1801. Butlin 1:627 records no 1801 or Edmeads and Pine watermarks in Blake’s own drawings.</p>
                <p>It seems unlikely that J. T. Linnell, an artist of considerable ability who exhibited 38 landscapes at the Royal Academy between 1850 and 1888, could have executed such skillful facsimiles before c. 1838, when he was 15 years old. John Linnell, Sr. could have made them at any point after his purchase of the originals in 1825. Stephen Somerville, the London dealer, tells me that my group of 6 designs was at one time in the collection of a son of J. T. Linnell. This however does not exclude a possible attribution to John Linnell, Sr. Indeed, if there were originally 12 copies, they may have been executed by John Linnell and divided between two of his sons—6 to John Linnell, Jr. and his heirs (from whom the work sold by Robinson was obtained) and 6 to J. T. Linnell and his heirs.</p>
                <p>The copies are the exact size of the originals and show no variations in the placement of motifs. Thus, the copies may have been made from tracings, although I can find no evidence of black or red chalk that could have been deposited by caulking the tracings onto the sheets bearing the finished copies. Nor is there any pencil under-drawing of the sort one would expect if a graphic telescope had been used (on the use of this device by John Varley and John Linnell to copy Blake’s Visionary Heads, see Martin Butlin, “Blake, the Varleys, and the Graphic Telescope,” <hi rend="i">William Blake: Essays in Honour of Sir Geoffrey Keynes</hi>, ed. Morton D. Paley and Michael Phillips [Oxford: Clarendon P, 1973] 294-304). I can find no indentations in Blake’s originals or other evidence to indicate that tracings were made from them.</p>
                <p>Other fine Blake facsimiles attributed to the Linnell circle, such as two versions of <hi rend="i">The Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi> (Santa Barbara Museum of Art and Tate Gallery—see Butlin #479, 481), and even the Linnell set of Job water colors (traced by Linnell and finished by Blake, Butlin #551), show a certain looseness and loss of strength in the faces. This group of <hi rend="i">Paradise Regained</hi> copies retains the expressive force of the originals. As the 1913 exhibition catalogue claims, “the copies are executed with such fidelity as to be easily deceptive apart from the originals” (41).</p>

In this checklist, “facsimile” is taken to mean “an exact copy” attempting very close reproduction of an original named copy including size of image, color of printing (and of tinting if relevant), and size, color, and quality of paper, with no deliberate alteration as in page order or numbering or obscuring of paper defects. It may, however, include added matter such as transcripts of Blake’s poems.</note></p>

              </title>
            </head>
            <p>The division is organized by individual (say, William Hayley or John Flaxman), with works by and about Blake’s friends and patrons, living individuals with whom he had significant direct and demonstrable contact. It will include Thomas Butts, Thomas Hartley Cromek, George Cumberland, John Flaxman and his family, Henry Fuseli, Thomas and William Hayley, John Linnell and his family, Samuel Palmer, James Parker, George Richmond, Thomas Stothard, and John Varley. It will <hi rend="i">not</hi> include important contemporaries with whom Blake’s contact was negligible or non-existent such as John Constable and William Wordsworth and Edmund Burke; such major figures are dealt with more comprehensively elsewhere, and the light they throw upon Blake is very dim.</p>
            <p>Reviews listed here are only for books which are substantially about Blake, not for those with only, say, a chapter on Blake. These reviews are listed under the book reviewed; the authors of the reviews may be recovered from the index.</p>
            <p>“Blake and His Circle” serves in part as an addendum to <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (1977) and to <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> (1995). I take <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> and <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement, faute de mieux</hi>, to be the standard bibliographical authorities on Blake<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> and have noted significant differences from them. <note id="n2"><hi rend="s">2</hi> Except for the states of the plates for Blake’s commercial book engravings, where the standard authority is Robert N. Essick, <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations</hi> (1991).</note></p>
            <p>In general, Keiko Aoyama is responsible for works in Japanese, and I am greatly indebted to her for her meticulous accuracy and her patience in translating the words and conventions of Japan into our very different context. Note that a large number of Japanese publications, discovered through her initiative, are recorded here from <hi rend="i">Blake Studies in Japan</hi> (1994) because they did not appear in <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement.</hi></p>
            <p>I am grateful to many kind assistants, especially to Peter Amies, Keiko Aoyama, Keri Davies (for a pamphlet), Robert N. Essick, Michael Ferber, David Fuller, Donald John, Mary Lynn Johnson, Raymond Lister, Peter Morgan, Stewart Naunton, Morton Paley, Michael Phillips, Dennis Read, James Stanger, Joseph Viscomi, David Weinglass, David Worrall, and particularly to Dr. E. B. Bentley.</p>
            <p>The chief indices used to discover what relevant works have been published were the <hi rend="i">Annual Bibliography of English Language and Literature</hi> for 1991 (1994—76 Blake entries); <hi rend="i">Art Index</hi> (March 1993-Oct 1994); <hi rend="i">Book Review Index</hi>, XXX (Jan-Dec 1994); <hi rend="i">Books in Print 1994-95</hi> ([Oct?] 1994—37 entries, including some duplicates and some not-yet existent); <hi rend="i">British Humanities Index</hi> (1993-94); <hi rend="i">Dissertation Abstracts International</hi> (Aug 1993-Nov 1994); <hi rend="i">Keats-Shelley Journal</hi> annual bibliographies (1991-1994); <hi rend="i">1993 MLA International Bibliography of Books and Articles in the Modern Languages and Literatures</hi> (1994—37 Blake entries); <hi rend="i">Romantic Movement:</hi> A Selective and Critical Bibliography for 1992 (1993 [i.e., Jan 1994]) (45 Blake entries), and <hi rend="i">Whitaker’s Books in Print 1994</hi> (Jan 1994—34 entries, including some duplicates and some not-yet-extant).</p>

            <p>By far the bulk of this checklist for 1994 derives first from over 300 items in Japanese discovered by Keiko Aoyama, many of them for years earlier than 1994, and second from addenda deriving from Joseph Viscomi’s magisterial <hi rend="i">William Blake and the Idea of the Book</hi> (1993).</p>
            <p>As usual, only a very small proportion of the publications in 1994 concerning Blake derives from study of original materials. Indeed, the editors of some of the editions below give no indication that they have seen any of Blake’s originals. And the vast majority of Blake criticism is concerned chiefly with other Blake criticism.</p>

            <p>There is very little to report concerning Blake’s writings. Only one leaf of prints from an Illuminated Book is known to have changed hands—<hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (c) pl. 11, 17 which gravitated to Robert N. Essic—and a number of minor editions were published. The next volumes of the Blake Trust series, though advertised for 1994, did not appear, but Dover reproduced the Blake Trust facsimile of the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (D) in reduced size and with other alterations. There were editions of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> in Catalan (1975) and Russian (1993), and somewhat miscellaneous editions of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Poems</hi> (1994—yet another Everyman edition), of <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi>, ed. Michael Mason (1994), and of the <hi rend="i">Works</hi> [i.e., some of the poetry] of William Blake (1994) for the Wordsworth Poetry Library. None of these adds significantly to the knowledge or understanding of Blake.</p>

            <p>The only significant new work reproducing Blake’s art is Robert N. Essick’s fine book on <hi rend="i">William Blake at the Huntington</hi> (1994).</p>
            <p>Commercial Book Engravings</p>
            <p>Aside from new locations for some books with Blake’s commercial engravings (some of them rather uncommon), the chief additions to knowledge here are the record of yet another edition of Josephus with Blake’s plates and detailed publishing information about the edition of Shakespeare with illustrations by Fuseli which Blake engraved (1805).</p>
            <p>Catalogues and Exhibitions</p>
            <p>Essick arranged a major exhibition at the Huntington Library which was accompanied by a somewhat trifling catalogue and a fine book of reproductions (above). There was also an exhibition at the new House of William Blake which
<pb id="p28-144" n="144"/>
included “a prophetic cake.” Adam Mills devoted a whole catalogue to Blake, including some quite uncommon items, and <hi rend="i">Blake Studies in Japan</hi> recorded almost a thousand Japanese publications related to Blake.</p>

              </title>
            </head>
            <p>After the extraordinary Blake books of 1993, with the admirable new Blake Trust reproductions, E. P. Thompson’s <hi rend="i">Witness Against the Beast</hi>, and especially Joseph Viscomi’s <hi rend="i">William Blake and the Idea of the Book</hi>, any sequels are likely to be on a comparatively humbler scale of accomplishment. None of the Blake books listed below is in the same class with these, though David Weinglass’s catalogue raisonné of Fuseli is worthy of consideration in the same terms.</p>
            <p>David Linnell’s <hi rend="i">Blake, Palmer, Linnell and Co.:</hi> The Life of John Linnell is fairly remarkable in terms of using original materials, for it is based on the very voluminous Linnell Papers and Ivimy Mss., though almost all those relating to Blake appear to have been published before. The series of papers from the conference on <hi rend="i">Historicizing William Blake</hi>, ed. Steve Clark &amp; David Worrall contain a good deal of original matter, some of it directly related to Blake, and J. M. Q. Davies, <hi rend="i">Blake’s Milton Designs:</hi> The Dynamics of Meaning (1993) provides sound arguments on the entire range of Blake’s Milton illustrations. Andrew Solomon provides another analysis of <hi rend="i">Blake’s Job:</hi> A Message for our Time. Two revisions of theses, Marvin Lansverk, <hi rend="i">The Wisdom of Many, The Vision of One:</hi> The Proverbs of William Blake, and Angela Esterhammer, <hi rend="i">Creating States:</hi> Studies in the Performative Language of John Milton and William Blake, are concerned particularly with “performative utterances” in Blake, and Jeanne Moskal, <hi rend="i">Blake, Ethics, and Forgiveness</hi>, discusses usefully an important aspect of Blake’s later thought.</p>
            <p>Even the wilder shores of Blake speculation and assertion were ill-populated in 1994. The best example may be the attack upon Patriarchal Criticism exemplified by the “almost rabid ferocity” of Robert F. Gleckner;<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> I have encountered no other rabid critics this year. <note id="n12"><hi rend="s">12</hi> Helen Bruder, “The Sins of the Fathers: Patriarchal Criticism and <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi>,” 147-58 of <hi rend="i">Historicizing Blake</hi>, ed. Steve Clark &amp; David Worrall (1994).</note></p>
            <p>Two of the most exciting developments were outside the field of Blake. One of the most impressive books for many years on Blake’s circle is D. H. Weinglass, <hi rend="i">Prints and Engraved Illustrations By and After Henry Fuseli:</hi> A Catalogue Raisonné, which is in almost every respect a model of what such a work should be. In generosity of illustration and extensive transcription of documents such as prospectuses related to prints after Fuseli’s designs, it has few equals anywhere in publications concerning English art history. Indeed, so far as I know, only Blake is served so well.</p>
            <p>And finally the information that a volume of Joseph Johnson’s professional letters for 1795-1809 has unexpectedly survived<ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref> is very exciting indeed. Since Johnson commissioned many Blake engravings, and since the workings of his publishing-house have been very little known, this offers the prospect of considerably increased knowledge—and perhaps a fascinating book about the letters. <note id="n13"><hi rend="s">13</hi> Claire Tomalin, “Publisher in prison: Joseph Johnson and the book trade,” <hi rend="i">TLS</hi>, No. 4783 (2 Dec 1994), 15-16.</note></p>

                  <p>Copperplate-Makers’ Marks</p>
                  <p>The manufacturers of copperplates of the kind used for engravings customarily or at least frequently stamped the back of the sheet of metal with their name and address, not unlike a watermark. The position of the mark is variable, and often it is incomplete because applied at an angle and not flush with the metal. Since such a mark defaced the copper, it prevented the use of that side for most engraving purposes. However, since copper was (and is) very expensive, Blake sometimes used the backs of copperplates for engraving his works in Illuminated Printing.<ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref> Indeed, it is likely that he did so a good deal more frequently than surviving evidence indicates, for when a large copperplate sheet was cut into, say, four pieces, the maker’s mark would ordinarily be visible on only one of them<ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref> (just as a watermark will only appear on half or fewer of the leaves cut from a sheet of watermarked paper), and, even when the copperplate-maker’s mark did survive on the print, Blake ordinarily took pains to conceal it by printing very lightly, by wiping ink from the area, and especially by coloring the area after printing. Note that the copperplate-makers’ marks listed below are reported chiefly from posthumous copies (<hi rend="i">America</hi> [N], <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> [I], <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> [H-J], <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> [a-c, e, g, i, k]) which were printed more heavily and carelessly than Blake’s own copies, and generally were not colored. When the copperplate-maker’s-mark is visible on a print, of course it is in mirror-writing, and ordinarily it is very difficult or impossible to decipher. <note id="n14"><hi rend="s">14</hi> No copperplate-maker’s mark has been reported for any of his commercial engravings, but the versos of copperplates from <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (1789) were apparently used in <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> (1794), from <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (1790) plus “The Approach of Doom” (?1788) in <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (1794), from <hi rend="i">America</hi> (1793) in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (1794), from <hi rend="i">Ahania</hi> (1795) in <hi rend="i">Ahania</hi>, and from <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi></note><note id="n15"><hi rend="s">15</hi> For instance, the surviving copperplates of <hi rend="i">Job</hi> pl. 14, 16 are on the versos of pl.

                <hi rend="b">Invention of Illuminated Printing</hi>
              </title>
            </head>
            <p>“The Approach of Doom,” in which Blake adapted a design by his brother Robert,
<q>
appears to have been Blake’s first attempt at drawing in an “impervious liquid,” perhaps shortly after his brother’s death in 1787, and it seems to have evolved out of a planographic transfer print. <hi rend="i">Doom</hi> may not have evolved directly, though. The vignette known as <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> plate a [<hi rend="i">a naked man being carried upwards by cherubs</hi>] may have been an intermediate step. [194]
</q>
Similarly, the separate prints of “Joseph of Arimathea Preaching” and “Charity”
<q>
seem to be early experiments in relief etching, which in turn suggest that <hi rend="i">illuminated printing</hi>, the printing of illuminated poems and books, evolved out of relief etching, which was motivated by the desire to duplicate drawings in facsimile rather than to publish preexistent texts. [195]
</q></p>
            <p>Blake probably composed his designs for works in Illuminated Printing directly on the copperplate (as he did the marginal designs to <hi rend="i">Job</hi> about 1824), rather than transferring designs created separately, and he may well have composed some of the text for works in Illuminated Printing in this way also, particularly in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi></p>
            <q>
Blake’s text could not have been [<hi rend="i">mechanically</hi>] transferred and . . . preliminary studies or models of page designs could not have preexisted their execution . . . . In other words, Blake’s innovation lies not in writing backward or in inventing an “impervious liquid,” let alone a supposedly new method of transferring text, but in appropriating as a printmaker the tools, materials, process, and, most significantly, the aesthetics of sketching. [370]
</q>
            <p>Blake scholars have often assumed that the creation of a work in Illuminated Printing was a very laborious and time-consuming process, but “A printable intaglio plate can be produced in about thirty minutes because the lines do not need to be etched deeply in order to print” (82).</p>

                <hi rend="b">Printing Works in Illuminated Printing</hi>
              </title>
            </head>
            <p>Works in Illuminated Printing are printed from the surface of the copperplate (as in printing from conventional typography) rather than from the recesses incised in the copper, as in intaglio engraving and etching, and ordinarily different inks are used for printing relief and intaglio plates. However, in printing his relief plates
<q>
Blake appears to have used an intaglio rather than relief ink. Intaglio ink consisted of pigment ground with various grades of burnt oil . . ., such as a walnut or linseed oil that had been boiled and then set on fire. Burnt oil was more viscous than boiled oil, making ink tacky and stiff. [95]<lb/><lb/>
Postumous copies . . . were printed with far greater pressure and, it seems, with machine-made relief inks. [10]
</q></p>
            <p>In printing his own works, Blake did not attempt to emulate the meticulous standards of his contemporaries, and he seems to have capitalized upon the irregularities of his printing. In a letter of 22 March 1911, the facsimilist William Muir calls Blake’s method “skilful carlessness,” and Essick (<hi rend="i">William Blake and the Language of Adam</hi> [1989]) says that Blake “expanded the circumference of the acceptable far beyond the limitations standard in the craft” (191).</p>
            <p>In ordinary printing, the printing surface (such as the copperplate) is placed face up on the bed of the press, and the paper is pressed down upon it. However, Blake appears to have placed the paper on the bed of the press, and the copperplate was imposed down upon the paper. For instance,
<q>
Plates 7-12 in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> copy G have horizontal and vertical pencil lines (some partly erased) on their face that correspond to the size of the plates. If these lines were meant to register plate to paper, then the paper must have lain on
<pb id="p28-146" n="146"/>
the press bed facing up and the plate placed on top of it, or the lines would not have been visible. This reverse printing method . . . would have prevented the paper from picking up any of the ink smudges in the shallows of the relief plate. Woodcuts were often printed [<hi rend="i">in relief</hi>] in this manner. [394]
</q></p>
            <p>One of Blake’s problems was that his copperplates, even within the same work, were different sizes, and consequently the margins of facing pages have different dimensions.</p>
            <q>
Given that registration was done by eye [<hi rend="i">i.e., not mechanically</hi>] and that plates were various sizes, diverse margins were inevitable. Facing pages with exactly shared margins, then, appear to be intentional. [105]
</q>
            <p>In ordinary printing in conventional typography, several pages of type (a forme) are printed on one side of a sheet of paper; for instance, in a folio with two leaves per folded sheet of paper, pages 1 and 4 would be printed on the outside of the sheet and pages 2 and 3 on the inside. Blake used this method at least occasionally and perhaps regularly for the copies he printed on both recto and verso of the leaf.<ref target="n19" type="note">19</ref> For instance, the proofs of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (K) pl. 21-24 were printed with four prints on one piece of paper, and the untraced proof (L) with pl. 25-27 are evidently the same (p. 107). <note id="n19"><hi rend="s">19</hi> In most surviving copies of Blake’s works in Illuminated Printing, each leaf is separate, not conjugate with its neighbor, but this may be the result of later trimming for binding rather than an indication of the manner in which the copperplates were printed.</note></p>
            <p>Occasionally he made mistakes. For instance, in <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (B),
<q>
He printed plates 5 and 7 as an outside form (they are in the same ink) and plates 6 and 8 as the corresponding inside form (they are also in the same ink). The leaf with plates 8 and 7 was reinserted into the binding, correctly, joined to the leaf with plates 5 and 6 by a strip of paper and stabbed three times with the other fourteen leaves. . . .Apparently Blake had forgotten which form he was inking when he printed these four plates.<lb/>
Printing plates in folio format [<hi rend="i">i.e., four prints on a piece of paper folded once</hi>] on aligned leaves . . . appears to have been Blake’s standard practice for books with facing pages, which . . . includes all copies of illuminated books produced between 1789 and 1793. [109]
</q></p>
            <p>In his early printing, Blake carefully wiped the ink from the margins of the plates so that the designs would appear without frames. However,
<q>
in 1795 . . . [<hi rend="i">Blake began</hi>] for the first time, to print the plate borders. . . . The borders invited or suited a more elaborate coloring style, since text and illustration were then framed and would have looked unfinished if the washes did not meet the border/frame. This is why washing and streaking the text—a method of washing that visually integrated text with illustration . . .—became common practice in books printed in and after 1795. [160-61]
</q></p>
            <p>The evidence which Viscomi has so laboriously accumulated demonstrates abundantly that
<q>
The times at which <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> claims Blake’s works were printed need to be adjusted, and the periods need to be redefined . . . This [<hi rend="i">first</hi>] period can be broken down . . . according to three distinct formats: recto/verso (1789 to 1793), color printing (1794 to 1795), and single-sided printing with borders and rich palettes (ca. 1795). After 1795 the format remained the same, though the coloring style continued to become richer and more elaborate. [372]
</q></p>
            <p>Since each copy of a work in Illuminated Printing seems to differ from every other copy, Blake scholars have often carelessly assumed that Blake normally printed one copy at a time in deliberately unique ways. However, Blake’s early practice was to print half-a-dozen or more copies of each print at a time; “to imagine that illuminated books were produced one at a time makes illuminated printing and its inventor monstrously inefficient” (374). Prints were later—sometimes years later—collated into books, using the best prints first; at the end of the process, only the inferior prints were left, and sometimes in these the printing was so weak or careless that Blake had to touch them up or retrace designs or letters extensively in order to make them acceptable.</p>
            <q>
Most copies of illuminated books were compiled from impressions printed and colored in small editions. That Blake used this mode of producing books requires one to question the intentionality and significance of most variations, redate copies of nearly all illuminated books, revaluate the role of illuminated poetry in Blake’s life, redefine his period and book styles, and, ultimately, reedit his work.

              </title>
            </head>
            <p>The conventional commercial method of coloring prints was for each worker to add a separate color; one would add the red according to a master copy and pass the print on to another who would add blue, and so on. However,
<q>
The limited palette used in early illuminated impressions suggests that labor was not divided according to the standard procedure of one color per person but by impression, and that Mrs. Blake colored entire impressions and books herself. [133]
</q></p>
            <p>It has often been assumed that the time necessary to color a print was very extensive, but, at least for early copies, this is not so. The early coloring was simple, and
<q>
In fact, many <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> impressions colored before 1794, like “The School Boy, “Holy Thursday,” or “The Chimney Sweeper,” have only one or two broad washes, which represent quick passes of a brush and nothing more. There is no outlining in pen and ink, no overlaying of colors, no treatment that was technically difficult or time consuming. . . .<lb/>
There is no reason to disbelieve [<hi rend="i">Blake’s friends Frederick</hi>] Tatham or [<hi rend="i">J. T.</hi>] Smith about Mrs. Blake’s having regularly colored impressions, though the quality of her work appears not to have been as high as Tatham states—and
<pb id="p28-147" n="147"/>
certainly not as high as Blake’s. Indeed, it is the very unevenness of quality in many books that reveals the presence of two hands. [133]
</q></p>
            <p>Catherine Blake probably colored <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (G-H), <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (C, M, R [<hi rend="i">Experience</hi> only]) and early copies of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> and <hi rend="i">Visions.</hi></p>
            <q>
I would even add to the list <hi rend="i">America</hi> copy K, which is loosely modeled on <hi rend="i">America</hi> copy A . . ., <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> copy C, and possibly <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> copy A; Mrs. Blake seems also to have helped in recoloring books, like <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy R, and coloring late copies, like <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy AA, ca. 1826. . . . [<hi rend="i">Such copies have</hi>] fewer colors, washes applied very flat and solid, and weak or incorrect modeling. The second hand is also characterized by a palette consisting primarily of pink, purple, bright blue, and yellowish green. With the exception of the frontispiece, the impressions in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> copy A reveal these traits. For example, in plate 14 . . . the pope is an opaquish purple, his throne is yellow gold, the cloud is pink and dark gray, the wings are bright blue, and the bodies are bright yellow with heavy black and gray washes. The gray and black washes in the cloud and garments are most revealing: they are crudely applied, following the lines of the forms but failing in their structural purpose of modeling those forms. . . . The coloring of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> copy A <hi rend="i">may</hi> be the work of Mrs. Blake, when she worked without a model; at the very least, it is not exclusively Blake’s. [133-34]
</q>
            <p><hi rend="i">Visions</hi> pl. 7 (A-E, H-M)
<q>
were printed in raw sienna, yellow ochre, and green ink as three issues of the same edition. The impressions from plate 7 . . . share the same palette, brush work, coloring techniques, and one of three compositions. These compositions evolve one from the other and each composition includes impressions from at least two issues. The compositions are (1) purple clouds over light purple or blue sky, (2) purple clouds over a yellow sky with a rising (or setting?) sun, and (3) yellow sky with a rising (or setting?) sun with pronounced rays.<lb/>
The first composition appears in copies H, C, B, and L. . . ., two copies printed in raw sienna aned two in green. The second composition is found in copies K, M, D, and E . . ., copies that were printed in all three colors. The third composition appears in copies I, J, and A . . ., one copy in yellow ochre and two in green. . . . The motifs, details, and coloring style appear to have been suggested by other impressions, since nothing in the original drawing (illus. 172) [<hi rend="i">which is a proof of the etching</hi>] indicated sun or clouds or necessitated such simple coloring. [135]<lb/><lb/>
[<hi rend="i">In Visions pl. 7</hi>] Theotormon’s right arm in copies C, E, J, K, L and M is cast in a purple shadow, with a touch of the same purple on the left elbow; technically, the shadow is one upward brush stroke, made in the same motion in nearly all of these copies. . . . [<hi rend="i">In Thel pl. 7</hi>,] The sky is formed in the same colors and manner in copies H, G, B, E, and M. Yet there is no printed line suggesting clouds; in copy O, printed years later, the background was painted in multiple bright colors to suggest twilight. The repetition of a form or gesture not part of the printed design suggests that it was generated by reference to other impressions, and thus sequentially and within an edition. [398]<lb/>
Mrs. Blake was probably responsible for the [<hi rend="i">Visions</hi>] copy C and H impressions, and possibly the copy L impression . . . [<hi rend="i">plus for pl. 7 still</hi>] copy M and probably copy K . . . [<hi rend="i">and</hi>] copies J and I. [142]
</q></p>
            <p>Some copies of Blake’s works were colored after his death. These include <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (E, M, e),
<q>
thirteen <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> impressions in <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy K, plate 1 (if not also all) of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> copy A, and the framelines and many of the blue and pink washes over interlinear decorations in <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> copy E; some posthumous copies were colored very well: <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy e (in imitation of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy Y) and <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy <hi rend="i">j.</hi> [367]

            <p>The only known copy of “<hi rend="i">All Religions</hi> was reprinted with <hi rend="i">No Natural Religion</hi> ca. 1794” (Viscomi, 229); no copy survives of the (presumed) earlier printing.</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">America</hi> (1793[-1831?])</p>
            <p>Copies were apparently printed in 1793 (a [proofs] + loose proofs, C-I, K-L, R), 1795 (A-B), ?1807 (M), 1821 (O), post-humous (N, P-Q) (Viscomi, 376-80).</p>
            <p>Viscomi, 389, reports a copperplate-maker’s mark on pl. 6 in copy M which I did not see when examining the original and cannot see in the Blake Trust facsimile of it (1963). N.b. Since <hi rend="i">America</hi> pl. 6 has a copperplate-maker’s mark (<hi rend="i">BB</hi>, 86n4), it cannot be the recto of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pl. 17 (<hi rend="i">BB</hi>, 145), which also has a copperplate-maker’s mark (as Viscomi, 389, points out). Keynes &amp; Wolf, <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Illuminated Books:</hi> A Census (1954) report a platemark on <hi rend="i">America</hi> (Q) pl. 2 which is invisible to me.</p>
            <q>
In [<hi rend="i">America</hi>] plate 3 . . . the blemish next to the word “Dark” of line 11 appears in both copies A and B, though it is darker in A; the same is true of the blemish at the end of the tendril from the <hi rend="i">A</hi> in line 16 and the traces of ink in the shallows of the lower tree trunks and inside of the border. The sequentiality of the copies is even clearer in plate 5, where the bottom border is half-wiped in the same manner (and with the same gesture) in both copies, and the same wove pattern of the paper or backing blanket—a very distinctive mark—is present, as it is in the left bottom corner of plate 6 and in lower left and right corner of the flames in plate 12. [Viscomi, 392]<lb/><lb/>
Plates 7-12 in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> copy G have horizontal and vertical pencil lines (some partly erased) on their face that correspond to the size of the plates. If these lines were meant to register plate to paper, then the paper must have lain on the press bed facing up and the plate placed on top of it, or the lines would not have been visible. This reverse printing method was used to print engravings on “paper, pastboard, Satin or any other thing you print upon” (Faithorne 70). In illuminated printing, it would have prevented the paper from picking up any of the ink smudges in the shallows of the relief plates. Woodcuts were often printed in this manner. [Viscomi, 394]

            <p><hi rend="i">Book of Ahania</hi> (1795)</p>
            <p>Both copies were apparently printed in 1795 (A-B) (Viscomi, 376).</p>
            <p>The six plates of <hi rend="i">Ahania</hi> are all 13.5 to 13.7 cm high by 9.8 to 10.0 cm wide, while the five <hi rend="i">Book of Los</hi> plates are all identical in height and almost identical in width (9.8 to 9.9 cm). With little more evidence than these coincidences in size, <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 113, suggested that <hi rend="i">Ahania</hi> pl. 2-6 “may have been” on the other sides of <hi rend="i">Book of Los</hi> pl. 3-4, 2, 5, 1 and Viscomi, 287, says that “The six <hi rend="i">Ahania</hi> designs were executed on three plates, with plates 1 and 5, 6 and 2, and 3 and 4 etched back to back.”</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">Book of Los</hi> (1795)</p>
            <p>Both copies were apparently printed in 1795 (A-B) (Viscomi, 376).</p>
            <p>Viscomi, 287, says that, pace <hi rend="i">BB</hi>, 113, <hi rend="i">Book of Los</hi> plates were not etched on the other sides of <hi rend="i">Ahania</hi> pl. 2-6.</p>

            <p>According to Viscomi,
<q>
That the raw umber impression preceded the raw sienna impressions is verified by traces of the former ink in plate 7 of copy B, which indicates that the umber had not yet dried. On the other hand, traces of green ink on plates 4 and 8 of copies M and E indicate that green precede [<hi rend="i">d</hi>] raw sienna for these plates. Raw sienna appears to have been followed by yellow ochre, in that plates 1 and 7 of copy D have traces of raw sienna. Moreover, plate 4 in copies E, B, and R are especially close: they share blemishes under the word “shrine” (line 2) and next to “spring” (line 9), and traces of ink along the inside top plate border. Plates 4 and 8 of copies M and E were probably the first pulls and printed together; that they are in different copies reinforce[<hi rend="i">s</hi>] the theory that most copies of illuminated books were collated from piles of impressions and not produced individually. . . . [253]<lb/><lb/>
Blake appears to have printed a pair of plates in the five colors before moving to a second pair; because the color sequence could vary among plate pairs, it is not possible to sequence the issues, let alone the copies, of the edition. . . . The five inks of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> required five different dabbers, otherwise one dabber would have had to have been cleaned five times for each plate pair. [254]

            <p>Viscomi, 389, refers to copperplate-makers’ marks on <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (A) pl. 2, 19, and 28 which I did not record in my notes of the original and cannot find on the Plowman facsimile of copy A (1929).</p>

            <p>Pl. 4 in copies H-I
<q>
appear certainly to have been printed with the impression in copy C: all three are printed in green ink with the illustration printed in shades of raw sienna and yellow ochre, the combination of inks characteristic of green copies C and F. These separate prints [<hi rend="i">in H-I</hi>] appear to have been extracted from copies E and F—or excluded from them when they were collated [Viscomi, 281].<ref target="n27" type="note">27</ref><note id="n27"><hi rend="s">27</hi> Viscomi argues that in <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> pl. 25 there are three etched faces in copy A and that a fourth is added to the copper in copies C-D, F. (“The added (or ‘middle’) faces is not ‘obscured’ in copy A (<hi rend="i">BB</hi> 179); it is simply not there” [413].) The absence of this fourth figure “in the proofs and copy A and its presence in the other impressions indicate that the copy A impression was the first pulled” (282).
                                    <p>However, this fourth figure (like the others) appears only in the color-printing—of course we don’t know what was etched—and in A it seems to be present but ill-defined. If the presence of three or four figures is determined by the coloring, not the etching, the copperplate of pl. 25 is not in two states, though the order of printing may be determined by the presence or absence of this fourth figure in the coloring added in the process of printing.</p></note></q></p>

It may therefore be useful to provide a list of where on the plates the copperplate-makers’ marks are to be found and in which copies:</p>

            <p>Numbers on the Copperplates</p>
            <p>As may be seen especially in copy J,
<q>
the plates, with the exception of plates 12, 14, 22, 40, 51, 54, 57, 81, 82, and 92, were numbered [<hi rend="i">on the copper</hi>] in the top right corners, either in white line . . . or in black line . . .

Plate 50, for example, was initially numbered as 19, and plate 18 as 20.<ref target="n28" type="note">28</ref><note id="n28"><hi rend="s">28</hi> Viscomi, 340.

            <p>Pl. 17: In l. 21, “labour” was altered in pen to “labours” (“make himself fit for labours”) in copy B, probably not by Blake (Viscomi, 147).</p>
            <p>Pl. 18: In l. 36, “cry Hand” was changed in pen to “Cry Thou!” in copy B, probably not by Blake (Viscomi, 147).</p>

<q>
flames in the top right corner are more extended in copies D-F and H-J than in copies A and C, with copy B being indetermined. . . . Yet one of the flames is extended further in copy C than in A, while another is extended further in both copies than in copy D—that is, their final shapes were determined by pen and ink finishing, and there is no change in the plate. [Viscomi, 342]
</q></p>
            <p>Pl. 25: Toomey claimed that pl. 25 was in three states,<ref target="n29" type="note">29</ref> but in fact one “state” of the print is created by pen-and-ink changes; the plate “exists in two states instead of three, and copies A and C-D are in the first state and copies E and F are in the second” (Viscomi, 342). <note id="n29"><hi rend="s">29</hi> Deirdre Toomey, “The States of Plate 25 of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>,” <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi>, VI (1972), 46-48.</note></p>
            <p>Copy A</p>
            <p>The copy bought by William Young Ottley was probably F (see below), rather than A (as in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 258).</p>
            <p>Copy F</p>
            <p>There are two sets of numbers in copy F, a shaky set in the second order in which Blake arranged the plates of Chapter II and a firm set in the first order:
<q>
the firm and emended numbers are neither in Blake’s hand nor in the same medium as the weak numbers. The weak numbers (set 1) are in an intense black oil-based printing ink, while the firmly written numbers (set 2) are all in a light black water-based writing ink. [The set 1 numbers are completely opaque and shiny, while the set 2 numbers are mostly a light black stain. The different media is [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] especially apparent in set 1 numbers that were gone over or repaired in pen and ink.] The numbers of the first set are generally larger than those in the second set, but they are poorly formed, even ragged and wavering, an appearance caused in part by the viscous medium but also possibly by Blake’s weakened state. These numbers, though, are unmistakably Blake’s, whereas the 2s, 4s, 6s, and 9s of set 2 are distinctly and consistently different from Blake’s in all other books—including <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> copy I, which was executed a few months before <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> copy F. . . . For example, Blake’s 4 is always closed [<hi rend="i">or rather the top left member is at a sharp angle</hi>] and the stem of his 9 is always ex-tended and curved under. . . .<lb/><lb/>
Blake’s numbers . . . are 2, 5, 6, 8 [gone over in pen and ink], 10, 13, 17, 22, 23; . . . 33, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 43 . . . 52 [gone over in pen and ink], 56, 57 [the 7 is Blake’s and looks like an 8], 63, 64, 65, 66, 70 . . . 77, 82, 88, 89, 96. The rest of the numbers are in set 2.
</q></p>
            <p>The second, firm set of numbers, sometimes altering the first, is by Linnell, following the (first) order of the plates in his own copy of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (C).</p>
            <q>
Linnell appears, then, to have received a partially numbered copy of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> in loose leaves, which required him to finish numbering the pages in pen and ink, using his own copy, copy C, as the model. . . . perhaps what reveals copy C as the model and Linnell’s hand most clearly is the Chinese white used extensively in plates 39, 76, 84, 87, 99, and 100 to create highlights and to model figures. This pigment was not used in any other copy of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (or any other illuminated book that I know of) except [<hi rend="i">Linnell’s copy</hi>] C ( . . .plates 32 and 47). . . .
</q>
            <p>It is not clear why Blake numbered only 29 plates, a few in each chapter, “But what is clear is his intention regarding this copy’s order: he meant it to follow copies D and E, an intention that Linnell apparently ignored or misunderstood.”<ref target="n30" type="note">30</ref><note id="n30"><hi rend="s">30</hi> Viscomi, 357-58, 360, 426.</note></p>
            <p>History: (1) It is probably copy F (not copy A, as in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 258) for which “M<hi rend="s">r</hi> [<hi rend="i">William Young</hi>] Ottley [<hi rend="i">gave Linnell £5.5s.</hi>] for M<hi rend="s">rs</hi> Blake for a copy of Jerusalem” on 11 August 1827, the day before Blake died (<hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> [1969], 594, 341, 347); Linnell probably collected the loose leaves of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> from Mrs Blake, collated them with his own copy, and delivered them to Ottley, with whose library they were sold at Sotheby’s, 21 July 1837, Lot 306, for £3. 18s. to Bohn; (2) Acquired by the dealer James Toovey, who added his “BURNHAM ABBEY BUCKS” bookplate and sold it in 1899 to (3) The PIERPONT MORGAN LIBRARY.</p>

            <p>Large Book of Designs (1796)</p>
            <p>Both copies were apparently printed in 1796 (A-B) (Viscomi, 377).</p>
            <p>In “the two copies of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> plate 1 from the <hi rend="i">Large Book</hi> copies A and B . . ., the highlights at the right corner and at the waves are exactly the same,” thus proving that they were printed at the same time (Viscomi, 303-04).</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> (1790-1827)</p>
            <p>Copies were apparently printed in 1790 (K-M [proofs], A, C, B, H), 1794 (E-F), 1795 (D), 1818 (G), 1827 (I) (Viscomi, 376-80).</p>
            <p>The conventional dating of the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> has long been c. 1790-93, but, according to Viscomi,
<q>
In the course of 1790, apparently within two or possibly three different but not necessarily widely separated plate-making sessions, Blake wrote and executed three sets of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> plates. Plates 1-3, 5-6, 11-13, and 21-24 have the rightward <hi rend="i">g</hi><ref target="n31" type="note">31</ref> and appear to have been written first; [II] plates 4, 7-10, and 14-20 have the leftward <hi rend="i">g</hi> and appear to have been written second. . . . [III] Plates 25-27 (“A Song of Liberty”) appear to have originated as an autonomous work, which was attached to the narrative as a kind of coda. . . .<lb/>
Plate 7 is the transitional plate . . ., with its first <hi rend="i">g</hi> tilting to the right like the <hi rend="i">g</hi> in plates 5 and 6, and its second [<hi rend="i">in the same line!</hi>] and subsequent <hi rend="i">g</hi>s tilting to the left. . . .<lb/>
Most of the [<hi rend="i">copperplate</hi>] sheets for <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> were approximately 30 × 21 cm. Most of the sheets can be reconstructed according to the self-contained units; plates 16-19, for example, share the same widths and heights and together form one 33.0 × 20.7 cm sheet, while plates 7-10 were probably cut out of one 30.1 × 20.7 sheet. It is therefore significant when plates made from the same sheet have both kinds of <hi rend="i">g</hi>, as with plates 12, 13, 20, and 27, which appear to have been etched on the backsides of four plates cut from the 29.7 × 21 cm plate used for <hi rend="i">Doom.</hi> Plates 12 and 13 form a self-contained unit with the rightward <hi rend="i">g</hi>, and plates 20 and 27 both end sections (14-20, 25-27) that are self-contained but have differently formed <hi rend="i">g</hi>’s. Assuming that the plates were prepared at the same time, it follows that their texts were probably written close to each other in time as well. In other words, if the use of the two <hi rend="i">g</hi>’s did not overlap in <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi>, then the one could not have been employed very far from the other. . . .<lb/>
Apparently they [<hi rend="i">both kinds of</hi> g] overlapped with one another and with the serifless <hi rend="i">g</hi> of the <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> plates, which showed up in nine of the twenty-seven plates of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi>. . . .<lb/>
The new leftward <hi rend="i">g</hi> was most likely introduced after the rightward <hi rend="i">g</hi>, and, regardless if early use was variable or exclusive, the new <hi rend="i">g</hi> made its first appearance in <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> plates 1 and 8 and in the second set of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> plates, presumably in late 1789 or early 1790.[237] <note id="n31"><hi rend="s">31</hi> D. V. Erdman, “Dating Blake’s Script: The ‘g’ Hypothesis,” <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi>, III (1969), 8-13, had argued that Blake formed his “g” with an unconventional leftward serif at the top from “the middle of 1791” until between “Nov 5 1802 . . . and March 25 1804” or until 18 June 1805, and made a rightward serif before and after these dates, but “Erdman’s hypotheses . . . on the formation of Blake’s <hi rend="i">g</hi> . . . are wrong” (Viscomi, 234); see also “Blake’s Sinister ‘g’, from 1789-93 to ?1803,” <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi>, III (1969), 43-45.</note></q></p>
            <p>Significant Variants</p>
            <p>Pl. 10-11, 15, 21: The etched “cave and rock formations” were masked in all save copies G and I; “The traces of ink on plate 10 of copy B . . . and especially those in plate 11 . . . reveal that the ink was wiped off the forms to prevent them from printing . . . The [<hi rend="i">cave and rock</hi>] forms are also revealed as slight embossments in the versos of copies A and F.”<ref target="n32" type="note">32</ref><note id="n32"><hi rend="s">32</hi> Viscomi, 110-11; the slight smudge visible on Viscomi’s illus. 134 is not clearly identifiable as the rocky island of the colored designs. <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 290, had recorded the rock formations as effects of coloring only for pl. 10-11, 21.</note></p>
            <p>Pl. 21: “The engraved white lines in the hill and ornament over the <hi rend="i">I</hi> of the first line” are missing in copy K (Viscomi, 91).</p>
            <p>Pl. 26: In the section numbered 15, “chariots” “was crudely altered in pen to ‘charots’” in copy B, probably not by Blake (Viscomi, 147).</p>
            <p>Copy B</p>
            <p>Binding: The leaf with pl. 7-8 was apparently at first reversed; then the “leaf with plates 8 and 7 was reinserted into the binding correctly, joined to the leaf with plates 5 and 6 by a strip of paper and stabbed three times with the other fourteen leaves.”<ref target="n33" type="note">33</ref><note id="n33"><hi rend="s">33</hi> Viscomi, 109; Blake seems to have been printing the work as if it were a folio, with two prints on each side of the paper: “He printed plates 5 and 7 as an outside form (they are in the same ink) and plates 6 and 8 as the corresponding inside form (they are also in the same ink). . . . Apparently Blake had forgotten which form he was inking when he printed these four plates.”</note></p>

            <p><hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (1811-18)</p>
            <p>Copies were apparently printed in 1811 (A-C) and 1818 (D) (Viscomi, 378-79).</p>
            <p>Variant: Pl. 3 In l. 21, “What” on the copper was altered on the paper to “That” in copy A; all other copies (B-D) give “What.”<ref target="n34" type="note">34</ref><note id="n34"><hi rend="s">34</hi> Viscomi, 420; Erdman, Keynes, and <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 309 n1, 311 record this as a change in the copper.</note></p>
            <p>Copy A</p>
            <p>History: (1) Probably acquired by Philip Hurd, in whose posthumous sale by Evans on 30 July 1845, Lot 162 it was described as “Blake’s Illustrations of Milton, &amp;c. COLOURED PLATES, 1834 [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>],” when it sold to Bohn for £6.17.6.<ref target="n35" type="note">35</ref><note id="n35"><hi rend="s">35</hi> The date is of course wrong, perhaps a misprint for the “1804” on the titlepage. The fact that the work is described as “PLATES” indicates that it consists of prints rather than watercolor designs for a poem by Milton, such as <hi rend="i">Comus. Milton</hi> (A) was bound in half Green morocco, like <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (A) which was Lot 161 in Hurd’s 1845 sale &lt;<hi rend="i">BBS</hi> 86&gt;.</note></p>
            <p>Copy C</p>
            <p>According to Viscomi,
<q>
The single frame line given the plates in copy C—the only copy of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> with frame lines—indicates that copy C was probably finished in or after 1818, when this stylistic feature first began to be used. . . . Copy C, in other words, was reworked and restructured more than once, probably before and certainly after—but not at the same time as—copy D.<lb/>
In copy C, plates a-e can be divided into two sets. The leaves of plates a, b, and d are slightly smaller than the others and were apparently cut with a knife, whereas the other leaves were torn in the usual manner from larger sheets. The bottom edges of these leaves are only half gilt because they were not level with the other leaves. . . . plates 4,7,25, and 41 . . . are watermarked “WHATMAN / 1808”; in all four the mark runs vertically at the outside edge of the leaf, either from bottom corner up to the middle of the leaf (4 and 25) or from the top corner down to middle of the leaf (7 and 41). The “1808” is positioned under “HATM”; the “8” is 1.75 cm high, and the “W” is 3.0 cm high. Plates c and e, which were printed on slightly thinner paper, are recorded as having the same mark (<hi rend="i">BB</hi> 305), but in them the mark is smaller and runs horizontally across the top right corner. The marks are fragments: “J W” in plate e and “TMAN” with an “8” under the “T” in plate c. The “8” is 1.6 cm high and the “W” is 2.25 cm high. The size of the “W” and size and position of the “8” corrspond exactly to the “J WHATMAN / 1818” paper used in <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy V and the first copies of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> (The Whatman 1824 and 1826 papers used in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> copy F have an “8” that is 1.7 cm high.) . . . [<hi rend="i">The numbers echo these divisions.</hi>] Plates b, a, and d were numbered 2, 3, and 17, whereas plates c and e were numbered 8* and 32*, denoted as supplementary plates. The first set of plates were [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] numbered in pen and ink like the other impressions, but plates c and e were numbered in an oil-based printing ink and are ragged-looking. These five plates were added to <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> C after it was initially collated. All five extra plates, along with plate f, were numbered integrally with copy D, ca. 1818, at which time plate 2 was not printed. [325-26]<ref target="n36" type="note">36</ref><note id="n36"><hi rend="s">36</hi> Viscomi, 328, argues that Wainewright’s copy of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> was copy C, not copy B as in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 319. However, in his letter of 28 March 1826, Wainewright says that in the copy of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> which he has “lately purchased” “The Title says in <hi rend="i">12</hi> books” (<hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> [1969], 327), and this is only true in copies B and D, and copy D was “finished” for Mr. Vine, not for Wainewright.</note></q>

            <p>According to Viscomi, 336, “The Order” was made not for James Vine, whose copy of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (V) is the only one so ordered, but for Blake himself after he’d sold his own copy of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (R) and had no copy left to serve as a model.</p>

            <p>According to Viscomi,
<q>
The sequence of plate 4 impressions can be established by tracing the changes in the cloud line trailing from the <hi rend="i">A</hi> in “Albion” in the last line. It is printed in the gray of the text in copy C, as are the birds. This is the first impression pulled. The second impression is copy F; the plate is again inked in gray and painted in colors, only here the trailing line is half-wiped, its lower portion is dabbed in red, and the birds are wiped away. The third impression, copy D, has the same gray and red cloud line, and the birds have been reinserted in a dark brown. In the fourth impression, copy A, Blake dabbed the top portion of the cloud line blue. In the fifth, copy B, the cloud line is printed in blue, the gap between Los’s head and the cloud is filled in, and the birds are reinked in brown. The sixth and last impression pulled was copy E; there are traces of the blue ink, but here Blake has color printed the shallow between the cloud and the woman’s head in red. This has to be the last copy, since the red ink is substantial enough to have left traces in subsequent impressions. The sequence of impressions for plate 4 is not the same as that for plate 1, which can be traced according to the color, disappearance, and reappearance of the birds. Their order appears to be copies F, B, A, C, D, and E. Essick found a slightly different order (<hi rend="i">Printmaker</hi> 129), but the point remains the same: the different printing orders of plates 1 and 4 indicate that copies were collated from sets of impressions and not printed one at a time.

            <p>Copy E</p>
            <p>Binding: (4) It was disbound by the winter of 1993-94, according to Anon., “Blake at the Huntington, Fall 1994,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, XXVII, 3 (Winter 1993-94), 98.</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> (1794-1802)</p>
            <p>Copies were apparently printed in 1794 (<hi rend="i">F</hi>, G-H, <hi rend="i">T</hi><hi rend="s">1</hi>; <hi rend="i">B-E</hi>), 1795 (<hi rend="i">J, O, S</hi>), 1802 (<hi rend="i">P, Q</hi>) (Viscomi, 376-77). Note that numbers of copies of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> were produced separately but later added to <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> to form <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience.</hi></p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (B-D), “The Little Girl Lost” and “The Little Girl Found” (pl. 34-36) were “borrowed from copies of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>,” but in <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (A, R) they are printed integrally with <hi rend="i">Experience.</hi> However, “in both copies A and R, plate 34 was printed in the ink of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> but plates 35-36 are in the ink of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>, as though Blake momentarily forgot about the transfer” (Viscomi, 294, 415).</p>
            <p>Significant Variants</p>
            <p>Pl. 9: In the first plate for “The Little Black Boy,”
<q>
From the earliest to the last impressions . . ., which were produced ca. 1795 and ca. 1825, the woman’s back is arched and her hair is in a bun. This is how Blake drew her on the plate. In all posthumous copies . . ., her back and hair have been altered on the plate. [Viscomi, 248]
</q></p>
            <p>There does indeed seem to be a difference, though the “bun” is at the bottom of her neck or the top of her shoulder rather than on her head (where one might expect to find a “bun”). There seem to be very faint traces in the posthumous copies of the former larger outline.</p>
            <p>Pl. 12: In “The Chimney Sweeper” of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> in copy AA, the first word of l. 20 (“And the Angel told Tom if he’d be a good boy / He’d have God for his father &amp; never want joy”) was changed in pen to “But” (“But have God . . .”); the change, “which makes little sense,” may have been made by Catherine Blake, who perhaps helped in the coloring of this copy (Viscomi, 146).</p>
            <p>Pl. 25: According to Viscomi,
<q>
“Infant Joy” . . . in [<hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>] copy U is an unrecorded first state: the bottom of the <hi rend="i">J</hi> of “Joy” crosses into the flower in this but not in any of the subsequent copies. . . . The presence of this first state and the very poor inking throughout the book indicate that copy U was the first copy of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> printed. [245-46]
</q></p>
            <p>In Viscomi’s reproductions (illus. 251-52, 274-77) of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (N) and <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (C, I, L, O), the “J” appears to be merely colored over, but in posthumous copies b (reproduced in the edition of Ruthven Todd [N.Y., 1947]) and c (reproduced in <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Writings</hi>, ed. G.E. Bentley, Jr. [1978], 48) it is clear that the curve of the “J” crossing the petal was removed from the copperplate.</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> (1789[-1808?])</p>
            <p>Copies were apparently printed in 1789 (E, V ?; <hi rend="i">F</hi>, I-J, X; A-H, K-M, Z, <hi rend="i">B-E</hi>), 1795 (<hi rend="i">J</hi>, N), 1802 (<hi rend="i">P</hi>, O, R/Y<ref target="n38" type="note">38</ref>, 1804 (P-Q, <hi rend="i">Q</hi>), 1811 (S, <hi rend="i">S</hi>), posthumous (T) (Viscomi, 376-78). <note id="n38"><hi rend="s">38</hi><hi rend="i"> Innocence</hi> (R/Y) was apparently printed as one copy but was later separated into two fragments.</note></p>
            <p>Printing: In early copies, “Many of the impressions contain the same accidentals. ‘The Lamb’ of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy E . . ., for example, has the same traces of ink along the inside of the wiped border as ‘The Lamb’ in <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy B . . . and other copies” (Viscomi, 115). Similarly,
<q>
an ink blot in the leaves beside stanza one of “Night” (plate 20) occurs with diminishing strength in <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy E, <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy I, and <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy F, which reveals that the three impressions shared the same ink, dabbers, paper, and printing pressure. [Viscomi, 243]
</q></p>
            <p>Copy I</p>
            <p>Binding: (3) It was disbound by the winter of 1993-94, according to Anon., “Blake at the Huntington, Fall 1994,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, XXVII, 3 (Winter 1993-94), 98.</p>
            <p>Copy R/Y</p>
            <p>According to Viscomi,
<q>
The facts that three of the nine extant impressions of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy R are blue and that all nine impressions constitute thirteen [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] impressions missing from copy Y strongly suggest that these two fragmented copies once formed a single copy. . . . The paper size of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copies Y and R is the same, approximately 20 × 15 cm, but what proves conclusively that the two copies were once joined is the fact that both sets of impressions were stabbed three times, 2.8 and 3.4 cm apart.<ref target="n39" type="note">39</ref> Copy Y/R was presumably broken up while in the Dimsdale family, perhaps at the time of or because of the fire damage. If so, then <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> Y/R was first acquired by someone other than the first Baron Dimsdale, since it was produced after the baron died. [308] <note id="n39"><hi rend="s">39</hi> “<hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> measures the stab holes in copy R as 2.6 cm and 3.5 cm apart (55). But those in the middle impressions—plate 18 of copy Y and plate 19 of copy R—are exactly the same” (Viscomi, 418). Copy Y was still <hi rend="i">“UNTRACED”</hi> when <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> was published; its stab holes are not reported in <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi>, 119-20, but copies R and Y are linked there.</note></q></p>
            <p>Copy T</p>
            <p>According to Viscomi,
<q>
The plates of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy T . . . were printed posthumously and colored in imitation of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy B. For example, the figures in “The Ecchoing Green” plates 1 and 2 are colored in the same five and eight colors as copy B; the difference is that in plate 1 the old man and the faces are pink in copy T and white in copy B. The shapes and colors (blue, pink, and orange) of the very distinct tripart [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] sky of “Spring” plate 1 are duplicated exactly, as are the shapes and colors (blue and pink) of the sky in “The Shepherd.” Copy T also imitates the plate order of copy B, except that the frontispiece and title plate are reversed and plates 53 and 15 are missing. The coloring model is not always so readily apparent because the undercoloring in imitation of copy B was touched up and supplemented with superfluous ornamentation and because an early coloring style was combined with a late printing style. [247]
</q>
All other posthumous printings of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> are combined with copies of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> to form <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of</hi><pb id="p28-154" n="154"/><hi rend="i">Experience</hi>, which are distinguished by lower cased identifying-letters (e.g., “<hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy c”).</p>
            <p>Copy W</p>
            <p>The list of plates missing from the untraced copy W included pl. 18 (“The Divine Image”), though this is not mentioned in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 366, as Viscomi, 416, points out.</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> (1794[-1831?])</p>
            <p>Printing: According to Viscomi,
<q>
“The Lamb” of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy N . . . features the same inking patterns (words darker and lighter) as “The Lamb” of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy O. “The Tyger” of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copies L and N has the same ink splatters under the tiger’s neck and the word “fearful,” and the <hi rend="i">e</hi> of “fearful” is touched up in both. In <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> L, N, and S, the letters <hi rend="i">O</hi> and <hi rend="i">W</hi> of “On” and “What” of lines 3 and 4 of the second stanza did not print and had to be touched up; in copy N, they were touched up in the same black ink used to number the copy. [416]
</q></p>
            <p>Copies were apparently printed in 1795 (A, R; I, L, O/K, M, W/N, BB<ref target="n40" type="note">40</ref> 1818 (T<hi rend="s">2</hi>, U), 1821 (V), 1825 (W, Y), 1826 (Z-AA), 1827 (X), posthumous (a-o plus separate pulls including Tate and Juel-Jensen; the coloring of K and M is also posthumous) (Viscomi, 376-81). <note id="n40"><hi rend="s">40</hi> Copies A and R were produced in a different print-run from the rest. Copies O/K and W/N are sets which were later separated.</note></p>
            <p>According to Viscomi, “The Sick Rose,” “The Garden of Love,” “The Little Vagabond,” and “Infant Sorrow” (pl. 39, 44-45, 48) were etched on four plates cut from “the full 22.2 × 13.7 cm sheet” (270) of copper. The fact that these four poems are not included in <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (F-H, T<hi rend="s">1</hi>)
<q>
signifies that these specific plates had not yet been prepared, that the sheet had not yet been cut, which in turn indicates that copies F-H and T1 were printed before copies B-E, which include these plates. [270]
</q></p>
            <p>Therefore copies F-H, T<hi rend="s">1</hi> “were the first copies of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> printed.”</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">Experience</hi> (B-E) were color-printed from the surface only (unlike F-H, T<hi rend="s">1</hi> which are color-printed from both surface and shallows) because they had to match back-to-back <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> prints, and shallow-printed designs can only be printed on one side of the leaf.</p>
            <p>Coloring: Viscomi says that
<q>
the stream at the bottom of “The Lamb” [<hi rend="i">pl. 8</hi>] and “The Little Black Boy” (plate 2) [<hi rend="i">pl. 10</hi>] is painted as green ground (in the same green color) in both <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy L and <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy N, which strongly indicates that the one was painted with reference to the other, and thus at the same time. <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy L was acquired by 1799 (<hi rend="i">BB</hi> 417), which means that both copies were colored between 1795 and 1799. [416]

            <p>Framing Lines: “Copies W and Y were printed in the same orangish brown ink and were given the same kind of elaborate

LONDON.”</head><figDesc>Such disfiguring stamps were placed only on the versos of plates, indicating strongly that the other side of this copperplate had originally been used for another purpose, probably for the frontispiece (7.0 × 11.0 cm) to <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> (1789).</figDesc></figure>
scroll and foliage borders”; “The changes in frame styles suggest this order: W and Y; Z and AA; X” (Viscomi, 365, 366).</p>
            <q>
Though they are possibly the work of Mrs. Blake, the frames [<hi rend="i">in W and Y</hi>] were not added after Blake’s death, since the numbers are Blake’s and they were written after the frames were drawn, as their placement out of the way of the scrolls and flourishes makes evident. Blake intended the designs to be framed more elaborately than ever before, and he may have drawn a few of the frames himself [<hi rend="i">as he did for Job</hi>]. [Viscomi, 366]
</q>
            <p>Copy A</p>
            <p>History: <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> does not note that between 1882 (when copy A was described as having 50 plates) and 1924 (when it was given to the British Museum Print Room with 54 plates), it was supplied with “a hand drawn copy” of pl. 2 and
<q>
uncolored lithographs [<hi rend="i">of pl. 50-52, b</hi>] printed in light black or reddish brown ink on unmarked paper. The leaves are the size of the authentic impressions, which indicates that the four facsimiles were specially produced to complete the copy. [Viscomi, 412]
</q></p>
            <pb id="p28-155" n="155"/>
            <p>Copy E</p>
            <p>Copy E, which was made from impressions printed and colored at different times, “was made visually coherent by being recolored in a consistent palette” (Viscomi, 145).</p>
            <p>Copy F</p>
            <p>“<hi rend="i">The Experience</hi> plates are printed on one side of the leaf only” (<hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 373n27), not “on both sides of the leaf” (<hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 383n3), as Viscomi, 412, points out.</p>
            <p>Copy N</p>
            <p>Binding: (4) It was disbound by the winter of 1993-94, according to Anon., “Blake at the Huntington, Fall 1994,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, XXVII, 3 (Winter 1993-94), 98.</p>
            <p>Copy Z</p>
            <p>The copy of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> which Blake showed to Crabb Robinson on 10 December 1825 (<hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> [1969], 323, 591) was probably Blake’s own copy (W), rather than copy Z, which Crabb Robinson paid for on 15 April 1826 (Viscomi, 365).</p>
            <p>Copy AA</p>
            <p>The copy of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> which Blake showed to Mrs. Charles Aders on 10 December 1825 (<hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> [1969], 319-20) was probably Blake’s own copy (W), rather than copy AA, which Mrs. Aders paid for on 29 July 1826 (Viscomi, 365).</p>
            <p>Copy BB</p>
            <p>Binding: According to Viscomi,
<q>
In the right margin of plate 3 is the date “1789,” written in the same ink and by the same hand [<hi rend="i">i.e., Balmanno’s</hi>]. Under “89” is “37” written in another hand and ink, which, as suggested by its former owner Justin Schiller, may refer to 37 years, thereby dating the binding 1826. [416]
</q></p>
            <p>Copy e</p>
            <p>The plates were all posthumously printed and colored (pl. 30-33, 37, 41, 44-47, 50-52 were not “coloured by Blake” as in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 417, 427),
<q>
but not all were colored similarly. Indeed, at least two colorists were involved. The two sets are similar only in that both are richly colored and use gold, but the colors in the thirteen impressions are deeper, more opaque, and were applied with a drier brush.<lb/>
“The Lamb” of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy e . . .imitates “The Lamb” of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy Y. . . . The colorist of copy e, in other words, used <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy Y as the model, copying the palette, technique, placement and shape of colors, as exactly as the colorist of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy T copies <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy B and the colorist of <hi rend="i">America</hi> copy Q copied <hi rend="i">America</hi> copy A.

            <p>Blake’s final order for the work was pl. a1-9, b3-4, 12, as Viscomi demonstrates; he reproduces the work thus from copies A (pl. b12), B (pl. a9), C (pl. a4, a8, b3-4), and G (pl. a1-3, a5-7) (Viscomi, illus. 228-39).</p>

Viscomi also provides useful new information about the imitations, such as that “In copy J, ‘Brentano’s New York’ was embossed in blind on the free front endpaper of each volume. In copy K, a small sticker pasted in the lower right corner of the inside front board of volume one advertises: ‘R. H. Johnston / 64 Nassau St. / Elegant Books / Best Editions / At low Prices.’ . . . both establishments were in business in the 1860s, and the former had a bindery” [207].

                <p>Tim Heath is creating in 17 South Molton Street a Blakean “centre for radical thought,” for “the dissenting imagination,” called “The House of William Blake,” “a fully commercial operation” for innovation in business, which will publish books, hold exhibitions, and be a center for a Blake society.</p>
                <p>A separate press release of 11 April 1994 for The House of William Blake says that it is
<q>
commissioning contemporary Artists to decorate Blake’s original lodgings in a way which best expresses Blake’s curious spirit today. The exhibition [<hi rend="i">1-14 August 1994</hi>] will include the work of those working in the fields of furniture design, poetry, kitchen ware, textiles, bathrooms, book binding, printing, engraving and cake-making amongst others. A Catalogue to accompany the exhibition will be available from late July. Most exhibits will be for sale and some may be eaten. . . . We will also be putting on some Children’s Summer Holiday Workshops during the Exhibition Period.
