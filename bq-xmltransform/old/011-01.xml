                <p>Between 1843 and 1845, Pamela Chandler Colman, an American Swedenborgian active
                    in the production of children’s books, was responsible for printing
                    in four separate publications nine different poems from Blake’s <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence.</hi>
                    <ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> Taken
                    together, these printings constitute a remarkable "edition" of
                    Blake’s poems, both for their text and for their accompanying
                    illustrations. As we will see, Mrs. Colman did not simply reprint a selection
                    from Wilkinson’s 1839 edition of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> or from
                    Cunningham’s <hi rend="i">Lives</hi> as we might expect at this time
                    in America; she apparently used an original copy of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>
                    and chose texts which she thought most appropriate for her young readers; she
                    even took the liberty of attributing to Blake a rather saccharine piece entitled
                    "Evening Hymn." Perhaps more remarkable, most of these poems,
                    taken from Blake’s illuminated pages, are accompanied by
                    illustrations, at least one or two of which seem to have been inspired by
                    Blake’s etched design and which constitute a graphic interpretation
                    of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Innocence.</hi> After presenting the
                    illustrated text of Mrs. Colman’s "edition" of
                    Blake’s poems, I will consider the question of her source text and
                    finally suggest two contexts in which to view her work: the genre of American
                    children’s books in the 1840s and the continuing interest in Blake
                    manifested by American Swedenborgians. <note id="n1">
                        <hi rend="s">1</hi> My
                        discoveries of six of Mrs. Colman’s insertions and of several
                        other early printings of Blake’s poems have been noted in my
                        "Unnoticed Printings of Blake’s Poems,
                        1825-51," <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi> 40 (Spring 1977); with
                        the exception of her insertions of "A Dream,"
                        "The Little Boy lost," and "The Little Boy
                        Found," Mrs. Colman’s printings of Blake’s
                        poems have not been noticed previously in Blake scholarship. For other early
                        printings and mentions of Blake helpfully arranged in chronological order,

                </p>
                <p>Mrs. Colman’s editorial career began in the 1830s, when her husband,
                    Samuel, established himself as a successful bookseller and publisher in New York
                    City. In addition to his adult publications and his sale of works by other
                    publishers, Samuel Colman began by 1839 to produce children’s books
                    edited, and sometimes written, by his wife. Their most extensive effort to
                    achieve some prominence in the field of children’s literature did not
                    begin until 1843, when the Colmans (who continued to reside and to publish other
                    works in New York) began to publish a number of children’s books in
                    Boston. Some of these productions, especially the original inventions of Mrs.
                    Colman, were published by "S[amuel]. Colman" of Boston, but
                    others, including all those with Blake poems, give on their title pages only

                        source of information about their publishing activities is the <hi rend="i">National Union Catalogue.</hi> Relevant to their New York activities
                        during 1843 and 1844 are J. C. Palmer, <hi rend="i">Thulia: A Tale of the
                            Antartic</hi> (New York: Samuel Colman, 1843), and a New York edition of
                            <hi rend="i">The Little Keepsake for 1844</hi> (see my note 5, below).
                        For Samuel Colman’s early publishing activities in New York see
                        "S. Colman’s List of Publications," appended to
                        Anon., <hi rend="i">Sunday Morning Reflections</hi> (New York: S. Colman,
                        1839), and his "List of Birthday and Holiday Presents Published by
                        Samuel Colman" appended to Jane Marcet, <hi rend="i">Willy’s Stories for Young Children</hi> (New York: S.
                        Colman, 1839), pp. 143-44. About the New York-Boston connection, one
                        possibility is that the "G. Colman" of Boston listed as
                        publisher of some of Mrs. Colman’s works was a relative who, in
                        some sort of business relationship with Samuel Colman, represented the New
                        York publisher’s interests in Boston.</note>
                </p>
                <p>Clearly the showpiece of the Colman’s juvenile
                    productions—and the one upon which must have depended their greatest
                    hopes for success—was the first of their Boston publications, the <hi rend="i">Boys’ and Girls’ Magazine</hi>
                    <ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> (illus. 1). The magazine featured
                    contributions by the genre’s leading authors, and the publishers went
                    to the special expense of having many illustrations especially designed and
                    engraved to accompany particular texts. Unfortunately, the <hi rend="i">Boys’ and Girls’ Magazine</hi> seems to have proved a
                    less successful venture than had been hoped, for no numbers were published after
                    the twelve for 1843. As an indication of the public’s disappointing
                    response during that year, we find, in the prefatory notice integral to the
                    third bound volume, the announcement that the next year’s edition,
                    which in fact never appeared, would be reduced in price to $1.00,
                    "trusting thereby to meet the wishes of a much larger number throughout
                    the whole country." <note id="n3">
                        <hi rend="s">3</hi> In addition to
                        the monthly and annual states described in the
                        "Prospectus" (illus. 1), the <hi rend="i">Boys’
                            and Girls’ Magazine</hi> was issued in tri-annual volumes,
                        which I have seen at the Wellesley College Library and at the New Church
                        Theological School, Newton, Massachusetts. The magazine is concurrently
                        paginated for the triannual and annual volumes, e.g., Blake’s
                        "The Blossom" appears on page 142 of Volume II of the
                        tri-annual volumes, which is also page 286 of the annual volume; my volume

                <p>
                    <hi rend="i">July 1843</hi> Mrs. Colman seems first to have encountered
                    Blake’s poems in the middle of 1843—probably, as argued in
                    a later section of this essay, in an original but uncolored copy of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> alone. She displays Blake’s
                    "Introduction" to <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> very prominently
                    as the leading piece of the July number (II, No. 3, 73-74), and she appends to
                    the poem a short biography of the author in which she promises future selections
                    from Blake’s "charming, illuminated volume" (illus.
                    2).</p>
                <p>For all Mrs. Colman’s Blake texts we can make here the general
                    observation that they vary from Blake’s original in accidentals of
                    capitalization and punctuation and in the normalizing of many of
                    Blake’s contracted forms, for example
                    "vanish’d" and
                    "pluck’d" in his "Introduction"
                    and "wandring" and "thro’" in
                    "The Little Boy Found." In Blake’s
                    "Introduction," our Victorian editor also has altered the
                    "chear" of Blake’s lines 6 and 10 to
                    "cheer" and has added Roman numerals as stanza numbers.</p>
                <p>That the Victorian illustration accompanying this printing resembles
                    Blake’s design of his frontispiece to <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> may
                    result from Mrs. Colman’s access to an original copy of
                    Blake’s work and her deliberate copying of his design (illus. 3). In
                    considering that we may have in 1843 a graphic reinterpretation of
                    Blake’s design, it is important to establish that the editor or
                    publisher has not simply chosen an extant engraving which seemed generally
                    appropriate to the subject matter, as would be the usual procedure in
                    children’s books of the period. In fact, the engraving accompanying
                    Blake’s "Introduction" to <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> was used at least once in later years, as the cover of Miss
                    [Mary Russell] Mitford’s <hi rend="i">The Rustic Wreath</hi> (Boston,
                    1849), published by W. J. Reynolds, who also republished several of Mrs.
                    Colman’s original works (illus. 4). But an examination of many of the
                    works Mrs. Colman edited or wrote and of publications by likely firms,
                    especially T. H. Carter &amp; Co., has not revealed an earlier use of the
                        engraving.<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> Neither have I found any
                    other engraving related closely enough in design so as to suggest that someone

                    some of the engravings in the <hi rend="i">Boys’ and
                        Girls’ Magazine</hi> antedated that publication by several years,
                    perhaps the oldest being the ornamental design bordering the dedication page,
                    which had been used as early as 1838 in <hi rend="i">The Metamorphoscope</hi>
                    (Boston: T. H. Carter). Nevertheless, my survey of the productions of Mrs.
                    Colman and her publishers makes clear that a great majority of the engravings in
                    the <hi rend="i">Boys’ and Girls’ Magazine</hi> were not
                    used earlier, although they were then frequently reused in later publications.
                    The unusually close correlation between texts and accompanying designs supports
                    the conclusion that new engravings usually were prepared to accompany specific
                    texts in the <hi rend="i">Boys’ and Girls’ Magazine.</hi>

                    (illus. 5). Mrs. Colman has made a drastic emendation of Blake’s
                    lines 6 and 12, which should read "Near my Bosom." Also, the
                    words "hears you" belong to line 10. That this poem is the
                    last feature in Volume II of the magazine suggests that Mrs. Colman was
                    deliberately beginning one number and ending the next number, and the second
                    tri-annual volume, with Blake’s poems.</p>

                    No. 1, 9) (illus. 6). In none of Blake’s texts is Mrs.
                    Colman’s brazen ear, which so handicaps her as an editor of poetry,
                    more obvious than in her multitude of substantive emendations to this poem, most
                    of which seem to have no special purpose and which serve to destroy
                    Blake’s meter and even his rhyme scheme. We begin with the addition
                    of the indefinite article to the poem’s title, and proceed to the
                    syntactical inversion of the first sentence, which should begin, "When
                    the voices of children are heard" and which should not include
                    "When" at line 3. In the next stanza (Mrs. Colman might be
                    excused for ignoring the stanza divisions which are somewhat unclear on
                    Blake’s illuminated page), we should have "Then" in
                    place of "Now" and "gone down" rather than
                    simply "down" in line 5. In the next line, Blake tells us that
                    the dews "arise," but Mrs. Colman, not content merely to have
                    them "fall," tells us that they "fall fast."
                    To complete the mutilation of this stanza, Mrs. Colman has omitted the
                    repetition of "come" at the beginning of line 7 and has the
                    morning appear in the "east" rather than in the
                    "skies," which fortunately does nothing further to disturb the
                    rhyme scheme because she has already emended the preceding rhyme word from
                    "arise" to "fast." This trend of unfortunate
                    emendation, which could only improve, does improve. In the last half of the
                    poem, our editor is content to destroy the final rhymes by changing
                    "bed" to "rest" at the end of line 12 and
                    then by adding "for joy" after a regularized spelling of
                    Blake’s "ecchoed."</p>
                <p>Although Mrs. Colman has not been very careful in attending to the texts of
                    Blake’s "Nurse’s Song," she has produced
                    an accompanying engraving similar to Blake’s designs for that poem
                    and for the title page of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (illus. 7, 8). I have
                    found neither an earlier nor a later use of the Victorian engraving. In the May

                    <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, however, there is an illustration which includes the
                    nurse and which is probably by the same designer (illus. 9). This illustration
                    also may have been produced with reference to Blake’s designs. Even
                    if it was not, the designer may have combined his preconceived iconography of
                    the nurse with some inspiration from Blake to produce the Victorian design
                    accompanying "Nurse’s Song." Here the repeated use
                    of the rather Georgian chair with its high, rounded back both on
                    Blake’s title page and in the Victorian design for
                    "Nurse’s Song" is particularly important, for we
                    should expect our later designer, if indeed he had no knowledge of
                    Blake’s design, to situate his nurse on a Victorian chair as had been
                    done in the designs prepared a few months earlier.</p>

                    to "hills laugh" at line 4, Mrs. Colman has given, instead of
                    the "He" which is quite clear on Blake’s
                    illuminated page, yet a third "ha" at the ends of he second

                    <hi rend="i">1843</hi> It was probably during the latter part of this year that
                    "Mrs. Colman" edited—and her husband and his

                    from their advertisements, was intended primarily as a Christmas and New
                    Year’s gift. Included in this small volume are Blake’s
                    "A Dream" and "A Cradle Song" (illus. 11).
                    In "A Dream," Mrs. Colman has emended the first words of
                    several lines: "Where" to "When" at line 4,
                    "All" to "Quite" at line 8, and
                    "Do" to "And" at line 10. She has also given
                    "do" for "how" at line 9, and
                    "beetle" for "beetles" at line 19. I have
                    found no other uses of this particular engraving, but it is very similar in
                    style to many illustrations of animals and foliage in the Colman and Carter
                    publications. <note id="n5">

                <p>"A Cradle Song" is included in a story, "The
                    Baby," which apparently was written by Mrs. Colman specifically to
                    display Blake’s poem and which reflects her continued enthusiasm for
                    his poems as works which should be known to her young readers (illus. 12). The
                    most substantial emendation is of line 4, which should read "By happy
                    silent moony beams." Mrs. Colman has also given
                    "weeps" for Blake’s verb "weep"
                    at line 20 and "Thus" for "Thou" at line 27.
                    This engraving, which is not in any event notably similar to Blake’s
                    original illuminations, also appeared with Miss A. A. Gray’s story

                    and is a good example of the reuse of a design which could fit several
                    narratives; here the design seems less appropriate to Blake’s poem
                    than to Miss Gray’s story, which begins: "‘The
                    Babe will not eat his breakfast; will he, mother?’ said little Laura.

                    monthly numbers later bound in three successive volumes. In the issue for June
                    1844 (II, 47) she incorrectly attributes the poem "Evening
                    Hymn" to Blake (illus. 13). I have been unable to discover the correct
                    attribution of this sentimental piece; the prominence which she has given
                    Blake’s other poems and the absence of any other likely poet named
                    William Blake indicate that she did indeed consider "Evening
                    Hymn" and "The Lamb" works by the same poet. Mrs.
                    Colman’s error in attribution suggests that she no longer had
                    Blake’s original printing at hand, that she was now working with a
                    transcription of Blake’s poems which she had apparently confused with
                    a transcription of some other poet’s work.</p>

                    mistakes which might be attributed to careless transcription, we have the
                    substantive emendation of three important lines. Mrs. Colman has altered line
                    14, which should read "For he calls himself a Lamb," and the
                    final two lines, both of which should read "Little Lamb God bless
                    thee."</p>

                    frequently used engravings which were at hand from their earlier publications
                    and from other sources rather than going to the expense of regularly producing
                    engravings especially for particular texts. In fact, the cherub from the
                    engraving for Blake’s "Introduction" to <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> in the <hi rend="i">Boys’ and
                        Girls’ Magazine</hi> for July 1843 is used in the successor
                    publication to illustrate a piece about the aeolian harp (III, 48) (illus. 15).
                    The availability of the engraving with which Mrs. Colman accompanies
                    Blake’s "The Lamb" might explain why the lamb is
                    attended in the illustration by a woman rather than by a
                    "child" as in the text of Blake’s poem and in his
                    design. Originally, this engraving may have been prepared as an illustration of
                    Wordsworth’s "The Pet-Lamb" in <hi rend="i">Poems
                        for the Little Folks</hi> (New York: Samuel Colman), p. 38, which is similar
                    in typography and format to Samuel Colman’s New York publications of
                    about 1839. The engraving was later put to at least one less glorious use, as an
                    illustration for the story, "The Dwarf in Search of a
                    Lodging," in Miss A. A. Gray’s <hi rend="i">John’s Adventures, or the Little Knight Errant</hi> (Boston: S.

                    <hi rend="i">1844</hi> As in the previous year, Mrs. Colman compiled a small
                    Christmas and New Year’s gift book, the <hi rend="i">Child’s Gem for 1845</hi> (Boston: T. H. Carter &amp; Co.),
                    in which she included Blake’s "The Little Boy lost"
                    and "The Little Boy Found" from <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>
                    (illus. 16). In the former poem, Mrs. Colman has added the word
                    "dear" to the first line, and she has made a quite significant
                    alteration in the sense of the poem by substituting "thick"
                    for "away" at line 8. For "The Little Boy
                    Found," our Victorian editor’s text agrees with
                    Blake’s except for the addition of "he" to line
                    6.</p>

                    <p>A case establishing that Mrs. Colman has taken an original copy of
                        Blake’s <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> as her source text would be
                        substantial support of speculation about Mrs. Colman’s designs as
                        a graphic Victorian reinterpretation of Blake’s art and would add
                        to our interest in her various emendations and in her enthusiastic response
                        to Blake’s illuminated work. Similarities between the Victorian
                        designs and Blake’s originals suggest Mrs. Colman’s
                        use of an original copy; further, we can establish that she had access to
                        Copy U of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> in New York in 1843, and we can
                        discount the possibility that she has used earlier letterpress versions of
                        the poems as her source. <q> Keynes gives a short history of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (U):<lb/>

                        New York to estimate the likelihood of his association with Mrs. Colman. I
                        have been able to piece together some idea of his American career from such
                        secondary sources as the <hi rend="i">NUC</hi>, Allibone’s <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi>, which includes articles on Robert and Mary
                        Balmanno written in 1858, and the New York Historical Society’s
                            <hi rend="i">Dictionary of Artists in America</hi> (1957), which relies
                        upon a search of records at the National Academy of Design and the American
                            Institute.<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> First, we can be certain
                        that Robert Balmanno (1780-1861, dates given in the <hi rend="i">NUC</hi>)
                        had emigrated to New York by 1843, the first year of Mrs.
                        Colman’s Blake publications. A date before 1835 is suggested by
                        Mrs. Balmanno’s "three poems written for special
                        occasions (July 3-4, 1835) at Geneva, N.Y." which were added to a
                        copy of her <hi rend="i">Poems</hi> (London, 1830; <hi rend="i">NUC</hi>
                        NB0074878), and we know that in 1843 she was exhibiting her works at the
                        National Academy (NYHS <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi>). Although Robert
                        Balmanno actually made his living in New York as "a clerk at the
                        customhouse" (NYHS <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi>), by the later
                        years of the 1840s and into the next decade both of the Balmannos occupied
                        places of at least some small note in artistic and literary circles. Mary
                        Balmanno published various short poems, continued to exhibit her still life
                        paintings, produced "the beautiful drawing of all the flowers
                        mentioned by Shakespeare, which excited so much attention at the New York
                        Crystal Palace in 1853-54" (Allibone), and in 1858 published <hi rend="i">Pen and Pencil</hi> (<hi rend="i">NUC</hi> NB0074877)
                        "illustrated with cuts, a majority of which were drawn on the block
                        by her own hand" (Allibone). This last work was published by D.
                        Appleton &amp; Co. as was her earlier edition of Thomas
                        Moore’s poems (1850, <hi rend="i">NUC</hi> NM0751581), a fact
                        which suggests a specific connection with Mrs. Colman, whose <hi rend="i">Innocence of Childhood</hi> was also published by Appleton in 1850 (<hi rend="i">NUC</hi> NC0555851). Robert Balmanno’s literary
                        career was quite similar. His first American work was published in 1846 (<hi rend="i">NUC</hi> NB0074881), and two years later his <hi rend="i">Stoke
                            Church and Park</hi> (<hi rend="i">NUC</hi> NB0074882) was printed with
                        illustrations engraved after his own designs. In addition to his few short
                        works in the <hi rend="i">NUC</hi>, we are told by Allibone that he
                        "contributed many articles to the London periodicals and to the New
                        York Knickerbocker, Evening Post, and Graham’s (Phila.)

                    <p>Although the preceding evidence documents the Balmannos’ literary
                        activities only after 1843, it seem reasonable to assume that their
                        association with literary circles probably began soon after their arrival in
                        New York. It would then seem quite possible that by 1843 the Balmannos may
                        have found their way to Samuel Colman’s successful publishing
                        house on Broadway which was "one of the first in this country to
                        publish illustrated books in color; and which became a gathering place for
                        literary men and artists" (<hi rend="i">Appleton’s
                            Cyclopedia of American Biography</hi>, III, 546), probably including
                        Longfellow and the dramatist Willis, whom Colman published (<hi rend="i">Dictionary of American Biography</hi>) (illus. 17). There they may have
                        loaned Blake’s illustrated volume to the publisher’s
                            <pb id="p11-13" n="13"/> wife, who was then editing an illustrated
                        children’s magazine. Of course <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (U)
                        may have come to Mrs. Colman in a multitude of other ways; it is even
                        possible that Balmanno had sold Copy U by 1843 and that she had it on loan
                        from someone else, possibly her brother-in-law, William, a publisher of
                        prints who was then preparing to open "the first gallery in the
                        city for the sale of pictures" (<hi rend="i">ACAB</hi>). It is the
                        combination of Mrs. Colman’s access to Copy U of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> together with her production of designs similar to
                        Blake’s originals which most strongly supports the case that her
                        source was this original copy of <hi rend="i">Innocence.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The remainder of the case for Mrs. Colman’s use of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (U) depends upon our exclusion of other possible
                        sources. We can first discount the possibility that Mrs. Colman has used
                        earlier letterpress versions of the poems. Wilkinson’s (1839) and
                        Tulk’s (1843 or later) complete editions of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> were the only letterpress sources to include all or even
                        most of the poems which Mrs. Colman prints. Tulk’s edition of
                        only twelve copies was printed on paper watermarked 1843 and may well have
                        been produced after Mrs. Colman’s first printing of a Blake poem,
                        in July 1843; neither do we have any evidence that a copy was available in
                            America.<ref target="n8" type="note">8</ref> We do know that at least
                        one copy of Wilkinson’s edition had made its way across the
                        Atlantic by 1843, for at a time almost exactly contemporaneous with Mrs.
                        Colman’s first printings, we find in the <hi rend="i">New Church
                            Magazine for Children</hi> (Boston: August-December 1843) five of
                        Blake’s <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> given in a text following
                        Wilkinson’s almost exactly;<ref target="n9" type="note">9</ref>
                        copies belonging to Emerson and T. W. Higginson may also have been available
                        at this early date.<ref target="n10" type="note">10</ref> Mrs.
                        Colman’s texts have no recognizable pattern of similarity to the
                        punctuation, capitalization, stanza divisions and other emendations by which
                        Wilkinson’s texts differ from Blake’s originals. It is
                        true that Mrs. Colman was not particularly careful with many of her texts:
                        for example, in Tennyson’s "The May Queen" (<hi rend="i">Boys’ and Girls’ Magazine</hi>, II, No.
                        1, 12-13) she gives only one "black" in line 5 and
                        contracts his "woven" to
                        "wov’n" at line 25, both of which emendations
                        adversely affect the meter. Yet the text in substance and accidentals
                        clearly shows that she was cognizant, if not particularly respectful, of
                        Tennyson’s printed text,<ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref>
                        and I think it reasonable to suppose that even someone who has treated
                        Blake’s "Nurse’s Song" as she has
                        would betray some familiarity with Wilkinson’s version if that
                        were her source. <note id="n8">

                        with detailed copies of Blake’s designs—which
                        eventually found its way to America, but its text differs in particulars
                        from that given by Mrs. Colman.<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> A
                        final possibility is that Mrs. Colman had seen an original copy of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> or of the complete <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> but

                        our purposes, new evidence about the availability of another copy would only
                        strengthen our most important argument: that Mrs. Colman has seen an
                        original copy of Blake’s illuminated work. Of course we should
                        like to know exactly which copy she used as a source text, but it is more
                        important that her texts, her enthusiastic reaction to Blake’s
                        works, and some of her illustrations may have been in response to the
                        original form of Blake’s art. <note id="n12">

                    <p>We must consider briefly some of the obvious problems and questions which
                        remain in connection with the hypothesis that the designs in Mrs.
                        Colman’s publications derive from Blake’s original
                        illuminations. How might the design have been transmitted from Mrs. Colman
                        in New York to T. H. Carter in Boston? Can we know who might have done the
                        designing and engraving? A study of the signed engravings in the
                        "Boys’ and Girls’" series of 1843
                        and 1844 shows the services both of Boston engravers (John Greene Chandler,
                        George T. Devereux, Fernando E. Worcester) and of New York engravers
                        (Alexander Anderson, Joline J. Butler, Marx M. Hart, and William
                            Howland).<ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref> These facts put us no
                        closer to knowing who actually designed or engraved the illustrations to the
                        Blake poems; none of these engravers seems to have been very active as a
                        designer, and none of the signed engravings bears a particular technical
                        resemblance to the Victorian illustrations of Blake’s
                        poems—but they do indicate that at least some of the designs and
                        engravings issued from New York. If the engravings illustrating
                        Blake’s "Introduction" and
                        "Nurse’s Song" were prepared in New York, we
                        can suppose, given her prominent and deliberate display of
                        Blake’s poems and the special production of the accompanying
                        engraving, that Mrs. Colman may have shown the designer Blake’s
                        original with instructions about how she would like text and illustration
                        arranged on the page. <note id="n13">

                    <p>We should also consider the immediate context in which Mrs.
                        Colman’s readers encountered Blake’s poems. The <hi rend="i">Boys’ and Girls’ Magazine</hi> is
                        generally representative of all four publications considered here. Although
                        the Blake printings have previously gone unnoticed, the work has a place in
                        the bibliography of American literature for the first printing of a
                        Hawthorne story. In the August 1843 issue, also containing the bowdlerized
                        version of "The Blossom," we find Hawthorne’s
                        "Little Daffydowndilly" (II, No. 4, 264-69), the story of
                        a boy by this name who, through various encounters with a rather irksome
                        character named Mr. Toil, learns that "diligence is not a whit more
                        toilsome than sport or idleness" (269). Even more important for its
                        contemporary reputation, the magazine had as contributors some of the most
                        popular writers of juvenile stories and verse (illus. 18). Jacob Abbott
                        (1803-79) was a prolific writer of moral works (48 pages in the <hi rend="i">NUC</hi>), most notably <hi rend="i">The Young Christian</hi> (1832 and
                        numerous editions thereafter) and of the extended juvenile series, the <hi rend="i">Rollo</hi> and <hi rend="i">Lucy</hi> books. Abbott had moved
                        to New York in 1843, and his contributions may well have resulted from his
                        personal association with the Colmans (<hi rend="i">DAB</hi>). T. S. Arthur
                        (1809-85) was another prolific writer of children’s books (36
                        pages in the <pb id="p11-15" n="15"/>
                        <hi rend="i">NUC</hi>), although his greatest fame came from <hi rend="i">Ten Nights in a Barroom and What I Saw There</hi> (1854), a volume
                        which enjoyed sales in the 1850s second only to those of <hi rend="i">Uncle
                            Tom’s Cabin</hi> (<hi rend="i">DAB</hi>). We should note that
                        Arthur manifested an interest in Blake after his involvement with Mrs.
                        Colman’s publications; his <hi rend="i">The Brilliant: A Gift
                            Book for 1850</hi> (New York: 1850) included the text of "The
                        Tyger" and a lengthy account of Blake’s life taken from
                        Cunningham (120-26). Later, Arthur repeated an anecdote from Cunningham in
                        "Death of Blake, the Painter," <hi rend="i">Arthur’s Home Magazine</hi>, 3 (March 1854), 220. The
                        publications of Lydia Howard Sigourney (1791-1865) may have exceeded those
                        of Abbott and Arthur combined, in number if not in length (<hi rend="i">ACAB</hi>, Vol. I, 154). In the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of American
                            Biography</hi> we read that "it is almost impossible to find a
                        number of one of the popular magazines of the thirties or forties that does
                        not contain a poem or an article by her"; indeed, "the
                        inevitable regularity with which her poetic tribute followed the demise of
                        any prominent person led a wag to declare that she had added a new terror to
                        death." Catherine Maria Sedgwick (1789-1867) was on one occasion
                        praised by her co-contributor, Hawthorne, as "our most truthful
                        novelist" (<hi rend="i">DAB</hi>). A series of novels published
                        from 1825-35 and marked by "extravagent and imitative
                        romanticism" (<hi rend="i">DAB</hi>) had established her as perhaps
                        the most popular woman author in the country, and she continued with
                        increasingly moral works until 1857. The only other contributors to the
                        magazine noted in American biography (<hi rend="i">DAB</hi> and <hi rend="i">ACAB</hi>) are Hannah Flagg Gould (1789-1865), and Frances Sargent
                        Osgood (1811-50), poets whose chief works were short, innocuous
                        contributions to magazines and annuals. In addition, Miss Gould edited
                        several juvenile works in this genre; Mrs. Osgood did some similar editorial
                        work and published several volumes of verse on floral topics.</p>
                    <p>Although Mrs. Colman apparently had managed to assemble for her magazines and
                        annuals the work of many well known writers, their contributions might seem
                        strikingly undifferentiated to the modern reader. What we might see as an
                        oppressive lack of innovation is not really so very surprising, for the
                        surge of juvenile literature in the thirties and forties had actually begun
                        with a formal code set for authors and editors by the American Sunday School
                        Union, which published 6,000,000 volumes between 1824 and 1830.
                        Contributions were to be adapted to the children’s level, to
                        adhere to high standards of style and content, to have an American
                        character, and to be morally and religiously impeccable, although

                    <p>This code and the strict traditions which flowed from it may help us to
                        understand Mrs. Colman’s treatment of Blake’s poems.
                        On one level, some of her emendations may be understandable attempts to
                        present Blake’s poems as correct and instructive models of the
                        English language—as any work in her collection might have been
                        expected to serve. This requirement certainly explains her addition of heavy
                        punctuation as well as many of her alterations of capitalization and
                        spelling, for example her regularization of "chear"
                        ("Introduction" to <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>) to the
                        standard Victorian American spelling, "cheer." Especially
                        in the case of Blake, whose text was difficult to read and whose works were <figure>

                        <pb id="p11-16" n="16"/> almost unknown, Mrs. Colman—in the best
                        tradition of nearly all of Blake’s nineteenth century
                        editors—apparently felt an almost complete freedom in bringing
                        his works into conformity with the established code. An innocent but
                        substantial example is the final line of "Nurse’s
                        Song"; Blake’s "And all the hills
                        ecchoed" may have been intended to leave the echo pointedly
                        unexplained, but Mrs. Colman apparently felt it necessary to make explicit
                        for her young readers that the hills echo "for joy," lest
                        they think otherwise. Similarly, the "dews of night" in
                        the same poem might be said to "fall fast" rather than to
                        "arise" because Mrs. Colman has in mind some scientific
                        explanation which she believes accurate for the phenomenon of dew (her
                        explanation seems no closer than Blake’s to the scientific fact
                        that dew condenses). Attention to the facts of Scripture may explain the
                        emendation of Blake’s "For he calls himself a
                        Lamb:" ("The Lamb," line 14) to "<hi rend="i">He</hi> is called <hi rend="i">himself</hi> a Lamb."
                        Mrs. Colman is correct in that Jesus never calls himself a lamb, although he
                        is often so named, e.g. John 1: 29. As for the illustrations, the piper and
                        cherub of Blake’s frontispiece are draped according to popular
                        stereotypes, while the angel is given a small harp and the shepherd a
                        faithful dog, because they serve, as does Blake’s poem, as proper
                        introductions to a series of moral poems and tales. About the emendation to
                        "A Blossom," we can easily understand Mrs.
                        Colman’s categorical exclusion of the word
                        "bosom"; this emendation also suggests her idea of a
                        Victorian order for the natural world as she would have the blossom wish the
                        sparrow and robin to be "In the greenwood tree" rather
                        than "Near my bosom."</p>

                        "Mrs. Pamela C. Colman" of New York had joined the Boston
                        Society of the New Jerusalem in 1833, and in succeeding years Colman
                        advertised and sold many of Swedenborg’s works and such
                        Swedenborgian collaterals as the <hi rend="i">New Jerusalem

                        <ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref> That Mrs.

                        from her <hi rend="i">Innocence of Childhood</hi> (New York: Appleton,
                        1850), which was reviewed and advertised in Swedenborgian periodicals and

                        although the master’s name is not mentioned.<ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref> Indeed it may well have been through the
                        Swedenborgian connection that Colman and T. H. Carter came together to
                        publish the volumes which are the objects of our study. Carter had joined
                        the Boston Society in 1821 and continued as an important member in

                        poems except for the remarkable coincidence that almost every other printing

                        many Swedenborgians were involved in publishing, but I think that the
                        evidence of specific Swedenborgian statements about Blake, especially the

                    <p>Unlike more conventional rationalists of the nineteenth century, the
                        Swedenborgians had no quarrel with what the editor of the <hi rend="i">New
                            Jerusalem Magazine</hi> called Blake’s "continual
                        intercourse with spirits" (p. 193). Swedenborg himself had
                        conversed frequently with spirits and had been privileged to visit their
                        heavens and hells on many occasions. The very fact that Blake had spiritual
                        visions argued for the existence of a spiritual world, the basic tenet of
                        the Swedenborgian world view. Blake’s error, they believed, was
                        "the strange use he made of this intercourse," and it was
                        seen in contrast to Flaxman’s rational, Swedenborgian
                        interpretation of his spiritual vision: <q> But while Flaxman believed in
                            the reality of a spiritual world, and in the actual and personal
                            existence of spirits, as fully as Blake, in him this belief had nothing
                            in it or with it of unregulated enthusiasm or of wild phantasy; he
                            believed, and he knew why and what he believed, . . . But it was not so
                            with Blake. He was gifted with perhaps an equal talent, and he appears
                            to have embraced some of the peculiar opinions of Flaxman, but not
                            understandingly; and these truths were, in his case, little more than
                            broken parts of a system of which he knew not the unity and coherence;
                            and they were mingled with falsities and made to minister to his
                            self-conceit, and grievously distorted by the false medium through which
                            he saw them. (p. 193) </q> Although Blake’s interpretation of
                        his visions was misguided, the editor believed that the worth of the visions
                        themselves was to be acknowledged: <q> We do not say that their [the
                            visions’] influence was destroyed or entirely perverted, for
                            there was enough in his character to justify the hope that this was not
                            the case; nevertheless, our readers will find in the following account
                            of him frequent occasions for pity and regret. (p. 193) </q>
                    </p>
                    <p>We should add that this same magazine was, some ten years later, the first
                        American publication (with the exception of American editions of
                        Cunningham’s <hi rend="i">Lives</hi>) to reprint one of
                        Blake’s poems, "The Lamb," in September 1842
                        (p. 40). Further, in 1843 and 1844 the <hi rend="i">New Church Magazine for
                            Children</hi> reprinted several of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Songs.</hi> Despite their criticism of Blake’s excesses in
                        interpreting his spiritual vision, the American Swedenborgians may well have
                        agreed with J. J. Garth Wilkinson’s argument, in the preface to
                        his edition of 1839, that at least Blake’s <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> represented a vision of the eternal state of childhood
                        in accord with Swedenborg’s teachings.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Colman had joined the Boston Society of the New Jerusalem on 7 April
                        1833, only a little more than a year after the articles about Flaxman and
                        Blake appeared in the Society’s publication, the <hi rend="i">New
                            Jerusalem Magazine</hi>, and that her husband was later a New York
                        distributor of that periodical also suggests <pb id="p11-17" n="17"/> that
                        she may have known the articles. Mrs. Colman may be sharing the special
                        interest of the other Boston Swedenborgians in sustaining Blake’s
                        memory when she chooses to introduce so prominently to her nineteenth
                        century readers the poems of Blake, whom, in accord with the editors of the
                            <hi rend="i">New Jerusalem Magazine</hi>, she associates with Flaxman in
                        her brief biographical sketch.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Colman’s Swedenborgianism also offers one explanation of her
                        emendations to Blake’s poems and illustrations. That she gives
                        "the Lord" instead of Blake’s
                        "God" in the penultimate line of "The
                        Lamb" may possibly reflect a habit of Swedenborgian expression,<ref target="n20" type="note">20</ref> but otherwise there is little evidence
                        of Swedenborgian influence in her emendations. Although many of her small
                        emendations are certainly due more to carelessness and to her insensitivity
                        to rhyme and meter than to a deliberate, philosophical interpretation, a
                        critical predisposition against Blake’s "unregulated
                        enthusiasm" and "wild phantasy" may have
                        increased her disregard for the authority of Blake’s given text.
                        As for the designs, Mrs. Colman may have agreed with Blake that his
                        arrangement of the piper and the angel were an appropriate illustration of
                        his "Introduction" to <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>, but
                        instead of the naked and energetic figures which Blake may have seen in the
                        excesses of his "unregulated enthusiasm," Mrs. Colman has
                        seen fit to present his design in a much more conventional and rationally
                        acceptable manner. We should add that however strongly Mrs. Colman may have
                        felt about the supposed Swedenborgian content of Blake’s vision
                        of innocence, she probably would not in any event have made overtly
                        Swedenborgian references in her emendations or in her short biographical
                        sketch of Blake, for such reference would have violated the requirements of
                        non-denominationalism. The reader familiar with Swedenborg’s
                        writings can recognize as Swedenborgian the references in her publications
                        to "Use" or to "Divine Providence,"<ref target="n21" type="note">21</ref> but these are presented in such a way
                        as to be consistent with the standard nineteenth-century Protestant view of
                        the world. The point is that just because she makes no overt connection
                        between Blake and Swedenborg, we should not discount the extent to which
                        Mrs. Colman may have shared in Swedenborgian interest in Blake’s
                        life and work and the possible significance of this interest in her decision
                        to display prominently a number of Blake’s poems. <note id="n20">

                    <p>In Mrs. Colman we have a person who, in the years of relative public neglect
                        which preceded the Blake revival of the 1860s, found the illuminated poems
                        of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> so interesting that she displayed them
                        prominently in her publications and possibly had some of Blake’s
                        original illustrations redesigned and engraved, thus providing us with a
                        unique graphic interpretation of Blake’s art. The context of her
                        little "edition" is important because it indicates some of
                        the various channels by which Blake’s reputation survived. We see
                        the fortuitous coming together of a copy of Blake’s poems,
                        probably <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (U), with a publisher, and we see that
                        Blake’s poems were of interest chiefly because of their openness
                        to interpretation as lyrics intended for the delight and edification of
                        children. Finally, Mrs. Colman’s printings reflect the special
                        Swedenborgian interest in Blake’s life and works which helped to
                        sustain Blake’s reputation during the years before Gilchrist.</p>

                <p>Blake’s "London" is a bitter lament for the moral
                    and political conditions of London, ending with these four lines: <q> But most
                        thro’ midnight streets I hear<lb/> How the youthful Harlots
                        curse<lb/> Blasts the new-born Infants tear<lb/> And blights with plagues
                        the Marriage hearse.<ref target="n22" type="note">1</ref>

                    </q> "London" may very well be the least controversial of
                    Blake’s poems, but this last stanza has been a problem for critics
                    and is in need of very close explication. The purpose of this article is not
                    only to clarify the meaning of these lines but to show Blake’s
                    precise and detailed awareness of the social conditions of his time, and thereby
                    to emphasize the caution expressed by some critics against moving too rapidly
                    from fact to symbol in the interpretation of Blake’s poetry.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="i">Blake’s Apocalypse: A Study in Poetic Argument</hi>,
                    Harold Bloom recognized "two possible readings" for this last
                    stanza, readings which "may reinforce one another": <q> One is
                        that the blasting of the tear refers to prenatal blindness due to venereal
                        disease, the "plagues" of the poem’s last line.
                        A closer reading gives what is at first more surprising and yet finally more
                        characteristic of Blake’s individual thinking. Most of <hi rend="i">London</hi> is sounds: after the first stanza, Blake talks
                        about what he hears as he walks the streets of his city. In the midnight
                        streets of the city, he hears a harlot’s curse against the
                        morality of the Bromions, who speak of her with the authority of reason and
                        society and, as they would suppose, of nature. But it is her cry, from
                        street to street that weaves their fate, the winding sheet of their England.
                        They have mistaken her, for she is nature, and her plagues are subtler than
                        those of venereal disease. A shouted curse can <hi rend="i">blast</hi> a <hi rend="i">tear</hi> in a quite literal way: the released breath can
                        scatter the small body of moisture out of existence. Blake knows his natural
                        facts; he distrusted nature too much not to know them. The tear ducts of a
                        new born infant are closed; its eyes need to be moistened before it can
                        begin to weep. Blake ascribes a natural fact to the Harlot’s
                        curse, and so the Harlot is not just an exploited Londoner but nature
                        herself, the Tirzah of the last Song of Experience. In this reading, <hi rend="i">London</hi>’s concluding lines take a very different
                        and greater emphasis. The curse of nature that blights the marriage coach
                        and turns it into a hearse is venereal infection in the first reading. But
                        Blake is talking about <hi rend="i">every</hi> marriage, and he means
                        literally that each rides in a hearse. The plagues are the enormous plagues
                        that come from identifying reason, society, and nature, and the greatest of
                        these plagues is the Jealousy of Experience, and dark secret love of the
                        natural heart.<ref target="n23" type="note">2</ref>

                <p>There are a number of reasons for questioning Bloom’s literal
                    "closer reading."<ref target="n24" type="note">3</ref> First
                    of all, although most of "London" is sounds, what the speaker
                    of the poem hears is not the curse itself but <hi rend="i">how</hi>
                    "the youthful Harlots curse / Blasts the new-born Infants tear, / And
                    blights with plagues the Marriage hearse." The object of
                    "hear" is not the curse but the indirect question, the
                    how-clause. "Hear" in this sense means "understand
                    the manner in which . . . ": it does not refer to a literal hearing.
                    The speaker, walking through the midnight streets, becomes aware of the
                    conditions and effects of the "Harlots curse," how it ruins
                    ("blasts") and blights. Secondly, it has been suggested by
                    Erdman that the "Harlots curse" is parallel to the
                    "Soldiers sigh" of the third stanza, and that Blake may have
                    been thinking about a curse written on the palace walls, not shouted in the
                        streets.<ref target="n25" type="note">4</ref> Third, Bloom’s
                    "closer reading" destroys the parallel metaphorical meaning of
                    "blast" (ruin or destroy vegetation) and
                    "blight." In his reading the reader’s attention
                    must move rapidly from the literal blasting (the harlot’s breath
                    moistening the baby’s eyes) to the more gradual onset of blight, in
                    spite of the alliteration. Fourth, it will be shown later in our argument that
                    Blake also <pb id="p11-20" n="20"/> wants to link the parallel ideas of the
                    "Infants tear" (the infant’s venereal disease) and
                    the "Marriage hearse" (the mother’s venereal
                    disease). Fifth, and last, Bloom (apparently) rejects the interpretation that
                    the harlot’s blast of breath can literally scatter the
                    child’s tear out of existence, since a newborn baby has no tear<ref target="n26" type="note">5</ref>; and his point seems to be that the harlot
                    causes the tear to come into existence by moistening the child’s eyes
                    with the breath of her cursing. But, in this case, the harlot is, logically
                    speaking, blasting the child’s <hi rend="i">eye</hi>, not the tear,
                    unless <hi rend="i">blast</hi> is reinterpreted to mean "cause to come
                    into existence," which considerably distorts the traditional meanings.
                    The "Harlots curse" must refer predominantly to venereal
                    disease, and this is what we intend to show in this article. <note id="n24">
                        <hi rend="s">3</hi> Bloom’s "closer reading" is
                        actually two readings: (1) a literal reading which takes the curse to be an
                        oral imprecation moistening the baby’s eyes, and (2) a symbolic
                        reading dependent on this literal reading. In this paper we are directly
                        questioning only the first.</note>

                        This interpretation is something of a straw man anyway; that the
                            harlot’s breath can literally scatter the baby’s
                            tear out of existence is contrary to ordinary language and the facts of
                            experience.
                        <p>A more common interpretation would reply that Bloom is demanding too
                            technical a knowledge of his reader and of Blake when he points out that
                            a newborn baby has no tear (at any rate, a "newborn"
                            baby could be two days old, and have tears). Such a reading would also
                            take "Infants tear" as a synechdoche meaning
                            "infant’s crying." This, however, leaves
                            the reader suspecting that Blake used "tear" largely
                            because it rhymed with "hear"; it shows a faulty
                            craftsmanship in Blake which we do not feel is necessarily in the
                            poem.</p>
                    </note>
                </p>
                <p>The main problem in interpreting these second and third lines of the stanza lies,
                    we suspect, in knowing what it means to <hi rend="i">blast</hi> a <hi rend="i">tear.</hi> Bloom also is aware of this and is to be commended for wrestling
                    with the problem; no other critic has dealt with it in such detail. We take
                    "blast" to mean predominantly "to ruin,
                    destroy" (OED, II, 8), especially to ruin or destroy the bud, flower,
                    or fruit of a plant. (It should be noted here that "blast" in
                    the sense of "ruin" may ultimately derive from the idea of a
                    "malignant wind" (OED, II, 7) which destroys vegetation; but
                    it destroys the vegetation by bringing disease, not by blowing the plant to
                    pieces. So, the "Harlots curse" may figuratively operate as a
                    "malignant wind" but only in the sense that it brings disease,
                    not in the sense that it blows away or apart.) But what does it mean to ruin or
                    destroy a tear? Blake could very well have in mind the effects of a particular
                    venereal disease, <hi rend="i">gonococcal conjunctivitis</hi>,<ref target="n27" type="note">6</ref> a form of gonorrhea which was certainly widespread at
                    Blake’s time and which shortly after birth produces an ugly, pussy
                    discharge from the eyes. The disease itself is an infection "contracted
                    from the birth canal during delivery."<ref target="n28" type="note">7</ref> Shortly after birth the newborn baby’s eyelids are
                    marked by a puffy, reddened appearance and are swollen shut; a green pussy
                    discharge oozes through the closed lids. In the days before penicillin, this
                    untreated disease progressed over a period of six weeks to involve the cornea
                    (an important protector of the eye), resulting in a perforated cornea with loss
                    of the eye. Thus, the child’s "tears" appear to be
                    quite literally "blasted": they have been changed to pus. The
                    child’s eyesight may also be "blasted" in that he
                    may lose his sight. <note id="n27">

                        Since <hi rend="i">gonoccal conjunctivitis</hi> is a form of gonorrhea, it
                        is not prenatal or congenital. A number of commentators have referred to the
                        "curse" as "prenatal," thinking, no
                        doubt, of the blindness resulting from congenital syphilis: see Bloom, p.

                        differentiated until late in the nineteenth century, Blake and others could
                        easily have thought of any form of gonorrhea as congenital and so a
                        "curse" passed on in the blood. See Charles Clayton
                        Dennie, <hi rend="i">History of Syphilis</hi> (Springfield, Ill.: Charles C.

                <p>Through this new reading, we can better appreciate the skillful parallelism of
                    the last two lines of the poem. Blake is moving from the immediate effects of
                    the youthful harlot on the newborn baby to her more pervasive effects on
                    marriage in general; he is moving from the more concrete, more nearly literal
                    blasting of the "Infants tear" to the more abstract, more
                    symbolic blighting of the "Marriage hearse," and this shift is
                    carefully reflected in his diction. Blasting and blighting in general destroy
                    vegetation and the two actions are linked with the "bl-"
                    alliteration; but <hi rend="i">blast</hi> refers particularly to the destruction
                    of the bud, fruit, or flower of a plant, and so Blake uses it to refer to the
                    actions of the harlot on the infant (the bud of the marriage plant). <hi rend="i">Blight</hi>, as a verb, refers to destruction of the plant in
                    general; and <hi rend="i">blight</hi>, as a noun, refers to the
                    "baleful influence" that destroys plants or "prevents
                    their blossom from ‘setting’" (OED, 1.); and so
                    Blake uses it to refer to the destruction of marriage (the plant which produces
                    the bud). Also, venereal disease would prevent the "blossom from
                    ‘setting’" properly.</p>
                <p>Just as the harlot infects the child with venereal disease (the "Infants
                    tear") so, in the last line of the poem, she more pervasively
                    ("with plagues") destroys marriage in general through venereal
                    disease ("Marriage hearse"). "Marriage
                    hearse" now becomes a dynamic symbol which fuses a number of suggestive
                    meanings. In the context of the poem it can be read grammatically as an
                    adjective modifying a noun and as a compound noun, each form having harmonious
                    overtones. In the first case, "hearse" is a description which
                    interprets Blake’s culture. It refers in general to the deadly
                    condition of marriage, in that marriage, for Blake, is a restrictive institution
                    (deadly, in a spiritual sense) which actually fosters prostitution;<ref target="n29" type="note">8</ref> and individual marriages are literally and
                    physically deadly, since the venereal disease is transferred to the wife and
                    children. "Marriage hearse" also calls to mind the marriage
                    coach (marriage is again spiritually dead) and the marriage bed<ref target="n30" type="note">9</ref> (marriage is again physically deadly). (An early meaning
                    of hearse is "bier," "the movable stand on which a
                    corpse, whether in a coffin or not, is placed before burial; that on which it is
                    carried to the grave" OED, 2.) <note id="n29">

                </p>
                <p>In the second case, "Marriage hearse" can be taken as a
                    compound noun; here the emphasis shifts from "hearse" to
                    "Marriage," and "hearse" virtually becomes
                    an appositive adjective ("marriage, which is a hearse") since
                    "Marriage" is the object of "blights." The
                    meaning is essentially the same, "marriage, which is a deadly
                    condition, spiritually and physically"; but the awareness of this
                    alternate grammatical form helps to account for the ability of the two words to
                    resonate, so to speak, to become musically dynamic. Not only are there multiple
                    meanings which harmonize, but there are also two conforming grammatical
                    structures by which the meanings are expressed.</p>
                <p>Mark Schorer, years ago, remarked that although Blake could "see
                    spiritual realities within natural objects and . . . could impose spiritual
                    realities upon nature," in his early poems he tends to
                    "illuminate facts by vision."<ref target="n31" type="note">10</ref> The last stanza of "London" shows this tendency
                    well. The speaker is walking the streets of London, listening; but he is also a
                    kind of prophet, the midnight also a moral and political darkness, and he hears
                    the facts and conditions of his city and passes judgment on them. He is aware of
                    the details of venereal disease, but he is also aware that it is a
                    "curse," inherited in the blood, which
                    "blasts" the child and his crying and "blights with
                    plagues" the institution of marriage and the mothers who must carry and
                    give birth to the diseased children. <note id="n31">

                <p>Reviewers were generous in their praise of the first edition; their welcoming of
                    this facsimile as "an essential
                    guide"—"both stimulating and useful" and
                    even "something of a landmark"—lulled my critical
                    faculties, so that when the opportunity of a reissue arose my first inclination
                    was merely to correct the manifest errors and occasional misprints, to put a
                    proper note of identification near the finely sketched portrait of
                    Blake’s wife Catherine on Notebook page 82 (Geoffrey Keynes having
                    pointed out that the sketch had been copied by Frederick Shields for the 1880
                    Gilchrist <hi rend="i">Life</hi> and there identified), and, with the necessary
                    rearrangement of adjacent items, to correct my mistaken dating of Poem 78 in the
                    Table on pages 56-58 and in the explanation on page 71. I intended also to cite
                    briefly, in the note to page 27, a clear solution to the puzzle of Emblem 10
                    which was proposed by Robert N. Essick in his review in <hi rend="i">Blake
                        Newsletter</hi> 32 (Spring 1975) pp. 132-36.</p>
                <p>When I sat down to check through the reviews for specific criticisms and
                    suggestions, however, I was gradually drawn into a sober reappraisal of my
                    "readings" of two of the emblem designs, one being that of the
                    figure resting on a cloud in a starstudded sky used by Blake in his strategic
                    "Introduction" to <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience.</hi>
                    "On pages 73 and N57, the figure in Emblem 36 must surely be identified
                    not as the future Bard but as the future Earth," declared Jean H.
                    Hagstrum in his review in <hi rend="i">Philological Quarterly</hi>, 53 (Fall
                    1974) 643-45. "Her position resembles that of a clear but unmistakable
                    Blakean icon . . . the position of Earth, of the Clod of Clay or Nature in <hi rend="i">Thel</hi>, of the sleeping girl in <hi rend="i">America</hi>, and
                    of <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi>" Long
                    uncertain about this figure, I had defined it as "the alerted Soul on
                    her cloud" as late as the galley-proof stage of the first edition, then
                    persuaded myself that it was, after all, "the Bard on his
                    scroll." Sir Geoffrey Keynes had once agreed that it was the Bard but
                    in his recent facsimile edition of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (1967) had come
                    round to seeing it as "Earth . . . a female figure reclining on a couch
                    borne on a cloud among a night of stars." What finally convinced me
                    were two pages of close <pb id="p11-22" n="22"/> argument for the Earth/Soul
                    interpretation in a copy John E. Grant sent me of his review scheduled for
                    publication in the Autumn 1977 issue of <hi rend="i">Modern Philology.</hi> It
                    is with relief and pleasure that I now belatedly join such a
                    "strong" company of scholars as Keynes, Grant, and
                    Hagstrum.</p>
                <p>John Grant’s review also questions my reading of Emblem 13, page 31,
                    as did Robert Essick’s. Where I saw a gowned
                    "Saviour" descending through a doorway, they see a gowned
                    woman ascending. The sketch is quite vague; what convinces me in this case is
                    the early wash drawing, kindly supplied by Essick, of what is clearly a variant
                    of the same scene (Fig. 43). William Rossetti had been substantially correct
                    with his caption, "The Soul entering Eternity. Exhibits a maiden
                    entering a door, guarded by two spiritual women" (Gilchrist <hi rend="i">Life</hi>, 1863, II, 248 no. 92). Another variant is
                    Blake’s design for Young’s <hi rend="i">Night
                        Thoughts</hi> (<hi rend="i">NT</hi> 510), in which the woman entering
                    "at the door of Heaven" is welcomed by a bearded man who
                    pushes the door open and represents "humble Love." (Another
                    version, emblem size, is a slight sketch of a figure entering a door, inscribed
                    "Frontispiece" above the drawing and "It is Deep
                    Midnight" below it. Since this sketch is drawn on the verso of
                    Blake’s title page "For Children The Gates of
                    HELL," the probability is, Martin Butlin suggests, that this and some
                    of the other unpublished Notebook emblems were at one time intended for a
                    separate, unpublished <hi rend="i">Gates of Hell.</hi>) As for Emblem 10, which
                    I can now see as a variant of <hi rend="i">A Breach in a City the Morning after
                        the Battle</hi> (1784) or <hi rend="i">War</hi> (1805), Essick has kindly
                    sent me an annotated tracing which helps to identify the edges of the broken
                    wall, the three corpses before and within the break, a small figure seen in the
                    distance through the break and walking to the left, and an eagle perched on the
                    wall. I would hardly say that "the eagle’s beak and left
                    wing are particularly clear in the emblem," since I see only the neck,
                    not the beak, but I do agree that "this arrangement at least seems more
                    likely than Erdman’s ‘lightning strikes the neck of a
                    woman whose slippered leg is extended at left.’" As
                    comparison with the variant versions makes evident, what I saw as cloud and
                    lightning are a clump of trees and the outlines of the eagle. What looks like a
                    giant leg proves to be the space between the edge of the broken wall and a
                    fallen body.</p>
                <p>Revising the account of Emblem 10, which I had called "War,"
                    required little more than a refining of connotations. But my erroneous accounts
                    of Emblems 13 and 36 had far-reaching effects. While I was wrestling with the
                    necessary revisions <hi rend="i">passim</hi>, and discussing them on the
                    telephone with John Grant, he gently urged me to examine and reconsider the sex
                    of the figure I had identified as Satan in the picture on pages 110-11. The
                    prominent rounded breasts ought perhaps to suggest Eve—or
                    Satan’s daughter and paramour, Sin. (But then Christ in the same
                    picture looks rather like that Bard—I mean "lapsed
                    Soul"— in Emblem 36, hair and gown: some suggestion of an
                    androgynous Human Form Divine?)</p>
                <p>Three females I had mistaken for males! I could take some comfort from recalling
                    the first part of Blake’s letter to the <hi rend="i">Monthly
                        Magazine</hi> in 1806 in which he protested the criticism of a painting by
                    Fuseli. The critic had mistaken a boy in Count Ugolino’s arms for a
                    girl. "Whether a boy or girl," Blake wrote,
                    "signifies not." Then he added: "but the critic must
                    be a fool . . . who does not know a boy from a girl." Small comfort. I
                    have omitted the first "who": "a fool who has not
                    read Dante": Blake <hi rend="i">knew</hi>, from reading Dante, that the
                    child was a boy. I had thought I <hi rend="i">knew</hi>, from reading Blake,
                    that those figures were male. By this time a simple patching here and there and
                    a note of errors would not do. I have now revised the descriptions of these
                    three Emblems completely, put in a query about Eve or Sin, and revised my
                    accounts of the sequences of emblems in Blake’s various numberings.
                    The changed readings of the three emblem pictures fortunately make no drastic
                    change in the sequences of variation between images of fear and images of hope
                    which constitute the dynamics of the series. Emblem 10 comes into sharper focus
                    as death and mourning after battle, with permissable allusions to the English
                    Civil War and the American War, while "the drift of hollow
                    states" suggests contemporary prophecy. Emblem 13, whether representing
                    Christ coming through a doorway toward us or a Soul going toward heaven, is an
                    emblem of hope. And Emblem 36, whether the Bard watching for Earth to respond to
                    "the Word" or the Earth awake to "the Word"
                    but not yet arising, is critically ambivalent. It can make a positive thrust in
                    the thematic series of the Notebook emblems; in the context of the
                    "Introduction" poem and its sequel
                    "Earth’s Answer" it may lead the viewer and reader
                    into a lapsed condition that puts the dawn of a future age far off. The fit of
                    text to picture, however, is a compelling reality: it is the Earth <hi rend="i">as globe</hi> to whom "the starry floor," prominent in
                    the picture, is given; the "watry shore" is given as boundary
                    to the earth <hi rend="i">as land</hi> (the "slumberous
                    mass"), and it is from that prison that her chained spirit answers in
                    the second poem ("Earth’s Answer").</p>
                <p>Four emblem pictures which I have added at John Grant’s suggestion, on
                    pages 98-99, afford further possibilities—which I leave others to
                    explore—for the reconstruction of Blake’s numbered series
                    of emblems. Figures 44 and 45 are sketches on a small sheet of paper which Grant
                    calls to my attention as bearing alongside their captions revised and thrice
                    revised numbers that seem to fit gaps in Table V (p. 64) of emblems in numbered
                    series. In Fig. 45 a bee-winged girl hovers with folded arms under an archway,
                    or possibly the branch of a tree. These drawings are not much like those in the
                    Notebook, but the possibility that they may have been considered for the
                    Notebook series cannot be ruled out. They <hi rend="i">are</hi> like the
                    drawings of Figs. 46-47.</p>
                <p>Figures 46 and 47 are less ambiguous and in a different category. Both were added
                    to blank verso pages, within the areas framed by the plate printed on the
                    rectos, in copy C of <hi rend="i">For Children: The Gates of Paradise</hi>, a
                    copy which Blake’s old friend George Cumberland apparently purchased
                    after his death. These added emblems, a flower-woman to match the fire-man of
                    the emblem it faces, and a printer at work following
                    "Death’s Door," show Blake still the relentless
                    emblem-maker. Perhaps they are restorations of earlier rejected designs; the
                    first Fig. 46, bears a kind of sibling relation to Fig. 45. <pb id="p11-23" n="23"/> But I have no ingenious speculations ready, nor has John Grant, who
                    led me to these surprises.</p>
                <p>Thanks, then, to Professors Essick, Grant, and Hagstrum, this new edition
                    contains significant improvements that have involved minor revisions throughout,
                    even in the index. And although I have found no way to make direct use of
                    "‘Blake’s Gothicised Imagination and the History
                    of England,’ David Bindman’s essay in <hi rend="i">William
                        Blake</hi>, 1973 (the Keynes <hi rend="i">Festchrift</hi> edited by Morton
                    Paley and Michael Phillips), my brief discussion of the historical sketches and
                    of the list of topics from English history on page 116 would benefit from the
                    wider context supplied by Bindman’s survey "of
                    Blake’s interpretation of the whole panorama of English history from
                    its mythological origins to the apocalyptic future."</p>
                <p>Jean H. Hagstrum is to be thanked for a most interesting textual correction of
                    "Public Address" sections 63 and 29 (N 20 and N 62). What has
                    always been read as "Poco Pen" and "Poco
                    Pend," but never made sense of, can now be confidently given as
                    "Poco Piu" and "Poco Piud." Hagstrum
                    observed that <hi rend="i">n</hi> was a misreading of <hi rend="i">u</hi>, and
                    Geoffrey Keynes noted that what looks like <hi rend="i">e</hi> (though loopless)
                    is indistinguishable from an undotted <hi rend="i">i</hi> (of which the text
                    affords frequent examples) and that Blake is attacking the slang of the
                    "Cunning Sures" (N 40); compare his scorn of their
                    "je ne sais quoi" in Poem 124 (N 41). The only other error of
                    transcription noted, and corrected, is "Accusation" corrected
                    to "Accusations" in Appendix page 95.</p>

                    least six months—on the authority of the following statement in John
                    Knowles’ <hi rend="i">Life and Writings of Henry Fuseli</hi> (1831):
                        <q> In the beginning of the year (1789), Fuseli published, in a small
                        duodecimo [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>, for octavo] volume, a translation of
                        Lavater’s "Aphorisms on Man;" which work,
                        written in German, was dedicated to him by this early and esteemed friend.
                        The dedication is dated October, 1787.<ref target="n36" type="note">5</ref>

                    is some reason to believe that the first edition of <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi>

                    that the volume was "now before us,"<ref target="n38" type="note">7</ref> other evidence indicates that the book was in print, and
                    therefore available to Blake, as early as perhaps May (the date of the
                    "Advertisement"), and very probably by June or July 1788. The
                    July 1788 issue of Joseph Johnson’s recently founded <hi rend="i">Analytical Review</hi> carried two notices of the book. <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> is listed as one of the "Books and Pamphlets

                        <lb/> The author of these
                        Aphorisms seems to have proceeded from the head to the heart, or rather the
                        study of one enabled him to trace the different forms the passions wear, and
                        to discriminate many of their almost endless combinations. We with pleasure
                        read the only maxims extant written by a benevolent man; and perhaps it is

                        "Dedication" and "Advertisement," the

                        <lb/> Many of the aphorisms are so well expressed
                        in the translation, that they have all the merit of an original thought
                        almost intuitively struck off. . . . The blemishes . . . are trifling; and

                        the goodness, discernment, and sensibility of the author.<lb/>
                        <lb/> The

                        37n. Admitting the real differences between Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> and Blake’s principles in the Natural
                        Religion tractates, one may nevertheless agree with Damon that
                        Lavater’s first two aphorisms (which Blake in his note called
                        "true Christian philosophy far above all abstraction")
                        bear a striking resemblance to <hi rend="i">All Religions are One</hi>,
                        principles 1, 2, and 7. Although none of the extant copies of the Natural
                        Religion tractates can be shown to have been printed as early as 1788, the
                        scholarly consensus is that the plates were probably etched at about that
                        time. Briefly, the evidence for this conjecture is that the size and
                        technical imperfections in the lettering and designs suggest that Blake was
                        experimenting with a new medium, and that the colophon to the <hi rend="i">Ghost of Abel</hi> ("1822: W Blake’s Original
                        Sterotype was 1788"), a work addressed to "Lord Byron in

                        One Crying in the Wilderness." If Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> is considered to be a positive influence upon the
                        Natural Religion tractates, then, as Martin K. Nurmi plausibly argues in <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi> (London: Hutchinson Univ. Library, 1975),
                        pp. 52-54, Bacon’s maxims may be considered a negative

                    the end of the year, part of the collection was published in German as <hi rend="i">Vermischte unphysiognomische Regeln zur Selbst- und
                        Menschenkenntniss</hi>, but without the dedication. The part of the
                    collection not published in 1787 was apparently reserved for a second volume of
                        1788.<ref target="n43" type="note">12</ref> Between October 1787 and May

                    the originals. And it was probably during the same period that either Fuseli or
                    Johnson employed Blake—who may have begun to experiment with
                    illuminated printing—to engrave the frontispiece after Fuseli.<ref target="n44" type="note">13</ref> By May 1788, when Blake’s first

                <p>That Blake did in fact obtain his copy of the book in May-July 1788 is probable

                    <figure/> As the engraver of the frontispiece and as a friend of the translator,
                    Blake seems to have had both opportunity and motive to acquire and begin to
                    annotate his copy of <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> as soon as it became available.
                    Further, nothing in Blake’s annotations would contradict a date of
                    composition as early as spring or summer 1788, and the evidence of offsets
                    gathered by G. E. Bentley, Jr. may indicate that Blake received an
                    unbound—and therefore possibly a pre-publication—copy of
                    the book, perhaps in partial payment for engraving the frontispiece.<ref target="n46" type="note">15</ref> In sum, although several problems in
                    Blake’s chronology await better solutions (or at least more precise

                    Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> would seem to be fairly secure,
                    and the traditional chronology of Blake’s annotations and Natural

                        it is not impossible that some of his annotations were made long after 1788.

                        me to have the ring of truth. "Blake," Gilchrist reports,
                        "showed his notes to Fuseli; who said one could assuredly read
                        their writer’s character in <hi rend="i">them.</hi>"<ref target="n47" type="note">16</ref> I had hoped to find that
                        Fuseli’s revisions for the second edition of <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> (1789) would show that he read and incorporated into his
                        revised text some of the suggestions found in Blake’s
                        annotations. Alas, a careful comparison of the two editions against
                        Blake’s comments does not confirm or deny Gilchrist’s
                        story, and it must therefore remain in the limbo of unsubstantiated
                        anecdote. <note id="n47">

                <p>While there is little doubt that Blake read, absorbed, and stole from Chatterton,
                    especially early in his career, the standard assumption has been, stemming
                    largely from Margaret Lowery’s <hi rend="i">Windows of the
                        Morning</hi>, that Blake’s borrowings from his near contemporary
                    merely signal his indebtedness to the eighteenth century, particularly to the
                    minor poets of the latter half of that century.<ref target="n48" type="note">1</ref> Trying to deal adequately and fairly with verbal echoes is, of
                    course, extremely risky, as the recent counterpoint between Michael Tolley and
                    Michael Ferber over Thel’s Motto newly demonstrates (<hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi>, Summer 1976). So much of the verbal poetic tradition
                    impinges upon a poet’s unconscious memory that it is more often than
                    not impossible to assign a phrase’s ultimate origin.<ref target="n49" type="note">2</ref> And, especially with a poet like Blake, such assignment
                    is all the more difficult because of his habit of wrenching, upsetting, or even
                    perverting the sense of the original to fit his own purposes—which
                    include frequently a turning of the echo (or quotation or near-quotation)
                    against itself. <note id="n48">

                </p>
                <p>One of the means Blake uses to accomplish such reversals or self-destructions is
                    the introduction into the verbal context of a contrary (or at least
                    superficially unrelated) allusion which, in its thematic import and usually
                    clear Blakean affinities, dominates the total verbal and imagistic context to
                    the point where assumptions about Blake’s indebtedness of the first
                    "source" are affectively shortcircuited by the second.</p>
                <p>Let me take a simple and characteristic case in point. At the close of the
                    Memorable Fancy preceding the Proverbs of Hell Blake’s Devil
                    "folded in black clouds" writes "with corroding
                    fires" the following: <q> How do you know but ev’ry Bird
                        that cuts the airy way,<lb/> Is an immense world of delight,
                        clos’d by your senses five? </q> As has been pointed out by
                        others,<ref target="n50" type="note">3</ref> the immediate source of the
                    first line, at least, seems to be Chatterton’s <hi rend="i">Bristowe
                        Tragedie</hi>: <q> Howe dydd I knowe thatt ev’ry darte,<lb/>
                        Thatt cutte the airie waie,<lb/> Myghte nott fynde passage toe my
                        harte,<lb/> And close myne eyes for aie? (11. 133-36) </q> The speaker is
                    "Syr Charles Bawdin," who is about to be executed, the
                    particular context his memory of escapes from death in battle and the consequent
                    irony of his present predicament. The sharpness of the contrast with
                    Blake’s context needs no comment. Indeed so obviously irrelevant to
                    Blake’s purposes are both Chatterton’s context and the
                    "darte," even if somehow manipulated to
                    "fit," that one wonders whether there is any point to
                    Blake’s making the allusion at all. It seems merely an unconsious (or
                    perhaps even conscious) borrowing of a felicitious phrase. <note id="n50">

                <p>Even early, however, such borrowing of felicities is not Blake’s

                    air" (or the water) has a long history in literature, extending
                    certainly as far back as Homer, Virgil, and Ovid<ref target="n51" type="note">4</ref>—and appearing prominently at least twice in Spenser

                        The flitting skyes, like flying Pursuivant,<lb/> Against foule feends to

                    of Guyon’s protector with <q> Cupido on Idaean hill,<lb/> When having
                        laid his cruell bow away,<lb/> And mortall arrowes, wherewith he doth
                        fill<lb/> The world with murdrous spoiles and bloudie pray.<lb/> (stanza 6) </q>
                    <pb id="p11-28" n="28"/> Here, then, is the likely "source"
                    for Chatterton’s passage, wherein he translates Spenser’s
                    heavenly spirits into the warrior martyr who, though obviously no longer
                    protected from harm, reasserts throughout the latter half of the poem the
                    righteousness of his life and career, his readiness to die, and his faith in a
                    future life in "the land of bliss" with "God in
                    Heaven." <note id="n51">

                <p>That Blake knew these lines from Spenser is, of course, a matter of speculation;
                    but in view of his apparently wide and careful early reading of Spenser it is
                        likely.<ref target="n52" type="note">5</ref> Further, in <hi rend="i">An
                        Hymne of Heavenly Love</hi> the nine orders of angels are presented
                    "with nimble wings to cut the skies, / When he [God] them on his
                    messages doth send" (11. 66-67), a passage that may have suggested to
                    Blake his characteristic perversion of angel-messengers into the Devil who
                    conveys his wisdom to "the minds of men" by corrosive writing.
                        <note id="n52">
                        <hi rend="s">5</hi> We might also note, from <hi rend="i">Muiopotmos</hi>, the phrase "air-cutting wings" (1.

                </p>
                <p>Be that as it may, the most important point about Blake’s context is
                    that it is even more Miltonic than it may be Spenserian. In <hi rend="i">Paradise Regained</hi> "the Adversary" <q> with envy
                        fraught and rage<lb/> Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air<lb/> To
                        Council summons all his mighty Peers,<lb/> Within thick Clouds and dark
                        tenfold involv’d.<lb/> (I, 38-41) </q> Similarly,
                    "folded in black clouds" Blake’s Devil hovers
                    "on the sides of the rock" "on the abyss of the five
                    senses, where a flat sided steep frowns over the present world."
                    Milton’s Satan must <q> tempt with wand’ring feet<lb/> The
                        dark unbottom’d infinite Abyss<lb/> And through the palpable
                        obscure find out<lb/> His uncouth way. . . . (II, 404-07) </q> And: <q> Into
                        this wild Abyss the wary friend<lb/> Stood on the brink of Hell and
                        look’d a while<lb/> Pondering his Voyage. . . . (II, 917-19) </q>
                    Blake thus draws directly on Milton’s abyss to help him define his
                    own "abyss of the five senses" and "the present
                    world." At the same time Blake surely recalled that Satan faced another
                    "steep" when he reached the borders of Eden, "a steep
                    wilderness" which to him "Access deni’d"
                    (IV, 132-37). If so, then his Devil represents both the imaginative man, the
                    artist, whose perception will not be restrained by the senses, as well as the
                    Miltonic Satan who longingly connives to enter the "delicious
                    Paradise" where, through those very senses (among other things, of
                    course), Eve is tempted. Perhaps this duality explains why the Devil is
                    unimaginatively "folded in black clouds" while at the same
                    time his corrosives can melt "apparent surfaces away, and [display] the
                    infinite which was hid" (<hi rend="i">Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>,
                    pl. 14).</p>
                <p>Although by virtue of these allusions alone the apparent allusion to Chatterton
                    is effectively swallowed up by the thoroughly Miltonic framework, Blake may have
                    recalled as well Eve’s dream in Book V of <hi rend="i">Paradise
                        Lost</hi>: <q> Forthwith up to the Clouds<lb/> With him I flew, and
                        underneath beheld<lb/> The Earth outstretcht immense. . . . (V, 86-88) </q>
                    Adam’s subsequent interpretation of the dream interestingly involves,
                    in familiar faculty-psychology terms, the senses: <q> of all external
                        things,<lb/> Which the five watchful Senses represent,<lb/> She forms
                        Imaginations, Aery shapes,<lb/> Which Reason joining or disjoining,
                        frames<lb/> All what we affirm or what deny, and call<lb/> Our knowledge or
                        opinion. . . . (V, 103-08) </q> Thus, if Blake indeed had this sequence in
                    mind, he artfully transforms Eve’s tempting prospect of the earth
                    (engineered by Satan) from far above into the speaker’s and the
                    Devil’s perspective, also from high above the earth, hovering
                    "over the present world." But for them, of course, there is no
                    temptation but rather the terror of the abyss of the five senses over which they
                    may triumph not by resisting temptation but by imaginatively overleaping the
                    constrictions of a sense-bound universe—by, in other words,
                    perceiving (and hence creating) their own "immense world of
                    delight" otherwise "clos’d by [their] senses
                        five."<ref target="n53" type="note">6</ref>
                    <note id="n53">
                        <hi rend="s">6</hi> We should recall that part of
                            Satan’s temptation (in the dream as well as later in reality)
                            is the achieving of godhood: <q> Forbidd’n here, it seems, as
                                only fit<lb/> For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men. (V, 69-70)
                            </q> The difference between Blake’s idea of
                            "godhood" and Satan’s (as well as
                            Milton’s) is a measure of both Blake’s distance
                            from the seventeenth century and the care with which he adapts
                            Milton’s Satan for his own prophetic purposes.
                    </note>
                </p>
                <p>Finally, we should note that the word "delight" itself, a
                    favorite of both Spenser and Milton, is steadily associated by the latter
                    especially with Eden, with God, with man as God’s creation, with
                    Adam’s relationship to Eve, and the like. While Blake was surely
                    aware of these associations, transforming them into his own conception of
                    imaginative bliss in a Blakean Eden, he may also have had in mind passages such
                    as the following dealing with God’s creation of a sublunary world of
                    delight: <q> Beneath him with new wonder now he views<lb/> To all delight of
                        human sense expos’d<lb/> In narrow room Nature’s whole
                        wealth, yea more,<lb/> A Heaven on Earth. . . . (IV, 205-08) </q>
                </p>
                <p>In one sense, then, the entire Memorable Fancy is a dramatic enactment of or
                    gloss on the first part of Plate 5 of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and
                        Hell.</hi> Adam’s interpretation of Eve’s dream
                    includes a discussion of Reason as the restraint of desire: <q> . . . what in
                        sleep thou didst abhor to dream,<lb/> Waking thou never wilt consent to do.
                        (V, 121-22) </q> Thus Eve’s temptations, in the dream and in
                    actuality, are clearly the models for Thel’s failure in <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> and Oothoon’s ill-starred triumph in <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion.</hi> And the transformation of
                    Milton’s Satan into the imaginative perceivercreator-artist, whose
                    worlds of delight are neither of the senses nor of the Miltonic God’s
                    Eden, is neatly prefigurative of Blake’s later efforts in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> to release the seventeenth-century poet from his
                    "fetters."</p>
                <p>We are obviously a long way from Chatterton, from the eighteenth century, and
                    from the "influence" of both. The <hi rend="i">Bristowe
                        Tragedie</hi> passage must be seen then as merely the vehicle for
                    Blake’s manipulation <pb id="p11-29" n="29"/> of Milton to his own,
                    and ultimately to Milton’s, benefit. If Chatterton’s
                    "darte" (a word which Blake uses only once in
                    Chatterton’s sense—in <hi rend="i">King Edward the
                        Third</hi>, III, 176<ref target="n54" type="note">7</ref>) and its warlike
                    associations remained in Blake’s mind at all, they too become
                    transmogrified into "Arrows of desire," "long winged
                    arrows of thought," "Arrows of Love," and
                    "Arrows of Intellect"—that is, the weapons of
                    "Mental Fight" whereby even "Bacon &amp; Newton
                    &amp; Locke" as well as "Milton &amp; Shakspear
                    &amp; Chaucer" may "appear in Heaven." And
                    perhaps Chatterton as well.<ref target="n85" type="note">8</ref><ref target="n86" type="note">9</ref>

                        reversal of Chatterton, but without the assistance of Spenser or Milton,

                        sources— and thus may suggest one way that we can conjecturally
                        date individual poems in the <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> (or at
                        least determine whether they are early or late). In the second stanza of <hi rend="i">Gwin, King of Norway</hi> Blake virtually takes over whole
                        Chatterton’s stanza xli of the <hi rend="i">Bristowe
                            Tragedie.</hi> But whereas Bawdin’s speech extols the virtue
                        of his noble father who taught him "To feed the hungry poor/ Nor
                        let my servants drive away/ The hungry from my door,"
                        Blake’s tyrants are those very nobles who "did feed/
                        Upon the hungry poor" and "drive/ The needy from my
                        door." A more elaborate transformation, though still without the
                        conversion factors of a Milton or a Spenser, is Blake’s rewrite
                        of Chatterton’s stanza lxii in "The Chimney
                        Sweeper" of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>, where
                        Chatterton’s ballad stanza is elongated into fourteeners and the
                        "councilmen" escorting Bawdin to his beheading become the
                        "Grey headed beadles" leading the children into St.
                        Paul’s cathedral. Since Lowery concentrated on apparent
                        similarities in wording, form, and tone, she ignores passages such as these
                        which involve major transmutations by Blake.</note>

                <p>The printing of intaglio plates was never a driving impulse with William Blake,
                    despite <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Book of
                        Los.</hi> During the years of his apprenticeship to James Basire, 1772-1779,
                    he undoubtedly learned how to pull a proof of any plate upon which he happened
                    to be working, in order to see what further work was needed upon the plate, but
                    such a proof did not have to be more than competent. He was trained as an
                    engraver, not as a printer.</p>
                <p>The copperplate-printer served an apprenticeship of at least five years and, like
                    all indentured and trained craftsmen, was naturally most protective of his trade
                    and his skills. It is, perhaps, noteworthy that the only two published works for
                    which William and Catherine Blake actually printed the plates, <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads</hi>, 1802, by William Hayley and the first
                    two volumes of the same author’s <hi rend="i">The Life and Posthumous
                        Writings of William Cowper</hi>, 1803, were provincial productions.</p>
                <p>Although William protested otherwise, in his letter of 30 January 1803 to James
                    Blake, anyone who has had the opportunity of examining several copies of either
                    work alongside one another will at once see that the prints do not exhibit the
                    mechanical, and often deadly, production-line perfection of those pulled by a
                    professional plate-printer.</p>
                <p>"The London section of Pendred’s <hi rend="i">Vade Mecum</hi>
                    of 1785 lists thirteen plate printers, fourteen engraver-printers, and one
                        rolling-press-maker."<ref target="n55" type="note">1</ref> Such a
                    listing, from a generalized work, can only be taken as a sampling of the actual
                    total. London being a comparatively small city at that date, however, it can be
                    accepted that it shows that there was always a plate-printer near at hand for
                    Blake, except when he lived in Lambeth and at Felpham. The natural thing for him
                    to do would be to take any plate upon which he was working round to the nearest
                    plate-printer and have a proof or two pulled. The cost was little and was far
                    outweighed by the trouble of setting up the press and all the paraphernalia to
                    do such a tiny job at home. <note id="n55">

                    to as little as £4 a ream. As a ream consists of five hundred sheets, this
                    breaks down to as little as about 1½d. to about 2½d. a
                    sheet. Of course, these sheets would be smaller than those required to print
                    "The Canterbury Pilgrims," but an estimate of 1s. a sheet for
                    paper of the requisite size does not seem out of order.</p>

                <p>There was no difference for a shorter run than that of a hundred, and, allowing
                    for a general increase in prices between 1810 and 1835, it seems likely that a
                    proportion of £8 per hundred would still apply.</p>
                <p>Copper has always fluctuated in value, so it is difficult to decide what the
                    plate would have cost. The plates for the <hi rend="i">Hesiod</hi>, bought
                    through Blake, averaged just over 7s. each. But it seems likely that Blake
                    brought down the price by buying secondhand plates of which he would use the
                    back or plane off the previous design with a snake-stone.</p>
                <p>The top price for any of the plates for <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of
                        Job</hi> was 3s.10d. I think that the price of copper, as always during
                    wartime, was high around 1810, and it is likely that the <hi rend="i">Job</hi>
                    plates might have cost 4s. at that time.</p>
                <p>As the plate of "The Canterbury Pilgrims" measures 35.5
                    × 97.5 cm., which is roughly seven <pb id="p11-31" n="31"/> times
                    that of the <hi rend="i">Job</hi> plates, 22 × 17 cm., it may be
                    assumed that the large plate would have cost about £1.8s., or, even if Blake
                    had used a thicker gauge of copper in view of the size of the plate (I am trying
                    to find out the gauges of the <hi rend="i">Job</hi> and "The Canterbury
                    Pilgrims"), as much as £1.10s.</p>
                <p>Although I doubt whether Blake produced a printing of the first state of
                    "The Canterbury Pilgrims" of as many copies as 25, I have made
                    an estimate based upon that number: <table rows="4" cols="2">

                    </table> Allowing for extras, including perhaps a pint of porter for the
                    pressman, the price might well be leveled off at £4.4s., which was the price
                    of one subscription, paid in advance, and it seems more than likely that Thomas
                    Butts, who bought the tempera painting of "The Canterbury
                    Pilgrims," would have provided this.</p>

                    An impression of the final state, given to me by Charles Sessler in Philadelphia
                    in 1947, faces me across my room as I write and makes me feel rather ashamed at
                    having pointed out that the material base of the work cost so little. But the
                    same can be said of the materials with which any artist works, and the costs are
                    the same for the bad artist as for the great one. The limbo of forgotten
                    engravings of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries contains many larger and
                    more pretentious plates which cost about the same to fabricate. It is the work
                    of art upon the plate which makes it memorable.</p>
                <p>I hope that these notes will be of some interest in giving a part of the economic
                    background of a poor artist during a difficult time, and also hope that anyone
                    who has any information about the costs of commercial plate-printers during
                    Blake’s lifetime will pass it on to me.

                    <p>At Morton Paley’s request, I went through the file of <hi rend="i">Kottabos</hi> in the library of Trinity College, Dublin: it consists of
                        three volumes in the original series and two in the new series, running from
                        1869 to 1895, with a pause between the series in the 1880’s.<ref target="n0" type="note">*</ref>

                            "The Fly" and "Carpe Diem" appear on
                            facing pages: <hi rend="i">Kottabos</hi>, 2(1873-77), 266-67.</note>
                        Edited by the distinguished classical scholar Robert Yelverton Tyrrell, <hi rend="i">Kottabos</hi> normally appeared three times a year. Each issue,
                        looking like a bound set of examination papers in spite of its pink paper
                        cover, was dated according to the term in which it
                        appeared—Michaelmas, Hilary, or Trinity. Apart from an occasional
                        prose parody tucked in at the end of an issue, it consisted entirely of
                        original verse and translations (usually verse) into and out of various
                        classical and modern languages, but chiefly from English into Latin and
                        Greek.</p>
                    <p>Most of the so-called original verse was extremely derivative; often the
                        author made it perfectly clear that he was attempting only parody or
                        pastiche. The series of "Poems Written in Discipleship" to
                        which John Todhunter contributed his two imitations of Blake was usually
                        accompanied by a footnote: "These poems are in no sense parodies,
                        but intend to be affectionate studies or sketches in the manner of some of
                        the masters of song." In other words, they are exercises in
                        pastiche. No doubt a parallel could be found in <hi rend="i">Songs of
                            Innocence</hi> or <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> for virtually
                        every line of Todhunter’s "Paradise Lost" and
                        "Paradise Found." The most interesting aspect of these
                        poems "Of the School of William Blake" may well be their
                        date, since they appeared in the issue for Michaelmas Term (i.e. Fall
                        Quarter), 1871. Another point worth noting, though it may be the result of
                        pure chance, is Blake’s apparent high position in the batting
                        order of the masters of song. Only Browning and Tennyson, in that order, had
                        preceded him, both imitated by Edward Dowden, Professor of English
                        Literature at Trinity, still remembered for his books on Shakespeare and
                        Shelley. After Blake in the series came Longfellow (imitated by the
                        otherwise unknown Percy S. Payne), Wordsworth (by Todhunter), "The
                        Earlier Style of Euripides" (by R. Y. Tyrrell, in Greek), and
                        Whitman (by Todhunter again). One might ask why Swinburne did not appear;
                        the obvious answer is that practically all the "original"
                        poetry showed his influence, especially that written by Oscar Wilde and his
                        brother William. One might have expected Oscar to be aware of Blake, but his
                        work for <hi rend="i">Kottabos</hi> offers no proof of this.</p>
                    <p>In the scholarly world of the time—and to a large extent in the
                        literary world, too—<hi rend="i">Kottabos</hi> owed its
                        reputation primarily to its contributors’ felicity in turning
                        English poetry into Latin and Greek verse, a Renaissance accomplishment
                        still highly prized among the Victorians. Shakespeare naturally offered the
                        greatest challenge and was probably the most frequently translated author:
                        classicists could not resist trying to turn Hamlet’s soliloquies
                        into the rhetoric of the Greek tragedians. Milton and Pope, steeped as they
                        were in the classics, went easily enough into Latin, though Dryden, perhaps
                        because of his Catholicism, was neglected by the staunch Protestants of
                        Trinity (Pope of course was Catholic, too; it was Dryden’s well
                        publicized <hi rend="i">conversion</hi> to Catholicism in the reign of James
                        II that caused Protestant resentment). Swinburne, as the author of <hi rend="i">Atlanta in Calydon</hi>, provoked attempts to translate him
                        into Greek as well as Latin. On the other hand, those who cared more for
                        grammar and meter than for <hi rend="i">belles lettres</hi> often turned to
                        translating humorous stage-Irish ballads or mediocre album verse. R. Y.
                        Tyrrell, over a number of years, hammered out a complete Latin version of
                        Thomas Hood’s "The Bridge of Sighs" in the
                        meter of the original—itself derived from medieval Latin verse.
                        Given the above facts, you can imagine my surprise and delight at finding a
                        Latin rendering of a Blake poem in the issue for Trinity Term, 1876.
                        Blake’s "The Fly" is translated into eleven
                        lines of Catullan hendecasyllabics under the hackneyed but appropriate title
                        "Carpe Diem." The Latin is signed "W. G.
                        T."—the initials of William Gerald Tyrrell, as we learn
                        elsewhere in the issue. No doubt he was a relative of the editor.</p>
                    <p>It was shrewd of the translator to see how neatly Blake’s poem
                        would fit into a classical subgenre. Too often we glibly categorize Blake as
                        Romantic and ignore the "Augustan" element in his earlier
                        work. By the way, Catullus, whom W. G. <figure>

                        Augustan in the Roman sense: he died nearly thirty years before Octavian
                        took the title of Augustus. Tyrrell’s version is surprisingly
                        faithful to Blake, if we allow for the vast difference in philosophic and
                        stylistic assumptions between Rome of the first century B.C. and late
                        eighteenth-century England. After being in contact with so much translation
                        and imitation, I could not resist giving my own line-by-line version of
                        Tyrrell’s Latin: it is much more literal than it may appear at
                        first sight.</p>

                        23:26-28, E 167), Blake shows a series of separate, enclosed human forms who
                        are apparently the inhabitants of these caverns. If Blake is making a
                        specific reference here it is probably to the Devil’s Arse cavern
                        in Derbyshire (see Damon, <hi rend="i">Blake Dictionary</hi>) which was
                        inhabited by the poor during Blake’s lifetime.<ref target="n59" type="note">1</ref> Charles Leigh’s <hi rend="i">The Natural

                        are stalactites and stalagmites plus the strong visual fancy of the
                        beholder. Leigh explains their popular interpretations as (E) a lion; (F)
                        the "Queen of Scots Pillar"; (H) and (I) as globes of
                        "Alabaster Sparr" called "the Font" and

                        Dropping of the Water from the Top of the Arch and the Sides." It
                        is probable that B. knew of this figure in Leigh’s plate<ref target="n60" type="note">2</ref> and associated its identification by
                        the local people as a memorial or "fable" of Albion who,
                        in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, is also "petrified" (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 34[38]:1, 7, E 177-78: <hi rend="i">J</hi> 46[32]:5, E

                        interpretation the solitary pillar now standing beside the human figure can
                        be recognized as a remnant of the sixteen pillars erected when: <q> the

                    <p>These crucial differences between vision and mere degenerate fancy make it
                        clear why the eighteenth century visitor to Pooles Hole saw a similarity
                        between the cave’s interior and the interior of a church. Instead
                        of the "Spiritual Verse" of the Decalogue, Joshua, Judges,

                        saw the rock shapes as an "Organ and Choir-work" and Font
                        (Bk. 3, p. 43).</p>
                    <p>Albion’s movements in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> imply that his
                        resting place is a variant of Pooles Hole. After a temporary manifestation
                        of rebellion when his "Great Voice of the Atlantic howled over
                        Druid Altars" and "Round the Rocky Peak of Derbyshire

                        Rock of Ages. &amp; he took his Seat upon the Rock" (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 57:15-16, E 205). The Peak’s prophetic
                        elevation (but capable of druid cruelty if reason usurps, <hi rend="i">J</hi> 21:34, E 165) has as its contrary the "horrid
                        Chasm" beneath ("the most terrible Chasm that I ever yet
                        beheld" Leigh on Pooles Hole, Bk. 1, p. 187), where a more deadly

                    <p>Blake’s longest lyric fable, "The Little Girl
                        Lost" and "The Little Girl Found," appears to be
                        influenced, in its plot and illustration, by the English ballad called
                        "Babes in the Wood" or "Children in the
                            Wood."<ref target="n61" type="note">1</ref> The sixteenth
                        century ballad Blake would have known from the copy he owned of
                        Percy’s <hi rend="i">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</hi>
                        (1765). The ballad, moreover, was popular in contemporary chapbooks. Not
                        many of these survive from the eighteenth century, and few of those that do
                        are illustrated. But we have some chapbooks from the early nineteenth
                        century which contain the ballad "Babes in the Wood" and
                        illustrate it in a manner indicating that Blake’s illustration of
                        "The Little <pb id="p11-36" n="36"/> Girl Lost" may be
                        based on illustrations of the ballad in the chapbooks of his time. In fact,
                        the picture on Blake’s first page of the song can hardly be
                        called an illustration, since nowhere in the song’s lyrics does a
                        young man embrace Lyca. Rather, Blake’s human figures embracing
                        beneath a tree seem to be a pictorial allusion to the ballad as it would
                        have been illustrated in Blake’s time. <note id="n61">

                    <p>The climax of the ballad, which is the episode most conducive to

                        way out of a forest in which they have been abandoned by their wicked uncle.
                        They lie down and die for lack of nourishment. As Thomas Percy records the
                        ballad, <q> Thus wandered these poor innocents<lb/> Till deathe did end
                            their grief,<lb/> In one anothers arms they dyed,<lb/> As wanting due

                        passage illustrated in a Banbury chapbook published by J. G. Rusher in about
                        1815 (illus. 1), and in a chapbook published by Benjamin Tabart in 1804
                        (illus. 2), reprinted by William Godwin in <hi rend="i">Tabart’s
                            Collection of Popular Stories</hi> in 1809.<ref target="n62" type="note">2</ref> The illustration on the first page of "The <figure/>

                        composition to the ballad illustrations. Blake’s Lyca and her
                        companion embrace beneath a tree that grows out of the picture’s
                        left-hand side. Above them flies a bird corresponding to the robin in the
                        Banbury chapbook illustration. In fact, Lyca appears to be pointing to the
                        bird directly overhead. <note id="n62">
                            <hi rend="s">2</hi> The reproductions

                            Library.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The similarity between the ballad and Blake’s songs extends
                        further. Lyca, lost in a forest, sleeps in a protracted manner that suggests
                        death. Moreover, lions befriend her, and in "Night" lions
                        are shown to be amiable only after death. (The Lyca songs were originally
                        grouped along with "Night" in the <hi rend="i">Songs of
                            Innocence.</hi>) Her transfer to a cave by beasts seems a sort of
                        funeral and recalls the kindness of the ballad’s robin. The
                        children in the ballad die of starvation. In "The Little Girl
                        Found," Lyca’s searching parents dream she has starved.
                        In the ballad, seven years elapse before their bodies are discovered by
                        humans. This period may have a numerical echo in the seven days that pass
                        before Lyca is found. The seven years of the ballad may also be reflected in
                        the age given to Lyca who, though she is obviously post-pubescent in the
                        illustrations to the songs, is said to be "Seven summers
                        old."</p>
                    <p>The focus of the relationship between the ballad and Blake’s songs
                        is death’s double meaning. Blake’s illustrations
                        indicate that nubile Lyca’s dying is sexual and takes place in
                        her lover’s arms. If Blake did have the ballad in mind as he
                        wrote his two songs about Lyca, his sexual theme may have been suggested to
                        him by two lines already quoted from Percy that seem especially charged with
                        sexual connotations: "In one another’s arms they dyed, /
                        As wanting due relief."</p>

                        designed by Wren. Blake was baptized in the church when Charles Moss was
                        rector, in a font designed by Grinling Gibbons. It is one of few Gibbons
                        sculptures in marble. The bowl shows three bas-reliefs: of Noah’s
                        Ark, the baptism of Jesus, and the baptism of the Treasurer of Candace by
                        St. Philip. The stand represents the tree in the Garden of Eden, with the
                        serpent coiled about it and Adam and Eve on either side.</p>

                        554-56. <q>
                            <hi rend="i">To the Editor of the Monthly Magazine.</hi>
                            <lb/> SIR,<lb/>
                            HAVING attended the annual meeting of the charity-children at St.
                            Paul’s, on the 28th of last month, I can hardly find words to
                            express how highly I was gratified, as well with the spectacle of
                            upwards of six thousand poor children clothed, maintained and educated
                            at the public expence, as with the astonishing effect produced by the
                            union of sounds from so many voices, chanting the praises of their great
                            Creator.<lb/> I should not, however, have troubled you with this, were
                            it not at the same time to transmit some observations I made whilst
                            there, in the hope, that by communicating them to the public through
                            your widely-extended miscellany, they <pb id="p11-39" n="39"/> may be
                            attended to by those concerned, and the effect of the whole improved to
                            the greatest degree possible.<lb/> As I was there pretty early, and
                            before many of the children had taken their places, the first
                            observation I made was that, notwithstanding the immensetheatre erected
                            and provision made, there was yet hardly sufficient room to accommodate
                            the whole of the different schools; many of the children finding a
                            difficulty in seating themselves, and, when settled, were much crowded.
                            Owing to this probably it was, that some few were occasionally had down
                            to the schoolmistresses below, to be plied with smelling-bottles to be
                            kept from fainting. And this would perhaps have happened to a much
                            greater degree, had not the day been as favourable as possibly could
                            have been for the purpose, without either rain or extreme heat.<lb/> As
                            each school must doubtless be made acquainted with the number of seats
                            allotted to it, this inconvenience might certainly be remedied, by
                            leaving as many of the younger children behind, (whose voices can hardly
                            be expected to add much to the general effect,) as may enable the
                            remainder to be well accommodated.<lb/> My next observation was upon the
                            choir of St. Paul’s, which sang alone in the Te Deum and
                            Jubilate, and in the greater part of the Coronation-Anthem and
                            Hallelujah from the Messiah, and which appeared to me to be much too
                            weak for that occasion, especially after the charity-children had added
                            their voices in the two latter; contrasted to the immense force of which
                            the choir seemed as it were annihilated; scarcely any thing but the
                            organ (at least where I sat) being to be heard. Surely upon so great an
                            occasion as this may justly be reckoned, the choirs of the Chapel Royal
                            and Westminster Abbey might be requested to lend their assistance, as at
                            the Festival for the Sons of the Clergy, with which aid the contrast
                            would not be carried to such an extreme, as must be the case with a
                            single choir opposed to such a force.<lb/> My third observation was upon
                            the performance of the charity-children themselves, whose extreme
                            steadiness and accuracy was astonishing, and did the highest credit as
                            well to themselves, as to the persons that had instructed them. In,
                            however, the beginning of the 100th psalm, with which the service
                            commenced, the effect was not so great as I had expected, owing probably
                            to a want of courage in many of the children, which might prevent their
                            putting out their voices so much as they did in the latter verses. But
                            in the 118th Psalm, before the Sermon, they made ample amends, as
                            nothing, I think, could exceed the wonderful and striking effect
                            occasioned by the transition from the full chorus, to the voices of the
                            girls alone on one side, and thence again to the full chorus, as was
                            also the ease in the Hallelujah succeeding it. The cathedral responses
                            and amens too were very accurately performed by them, and well in time.
                            I cannot, however, help thinking, but that, in the Coronation-Anthem,
                            and Hallelujah chorus from the Messiah, a considerable improvement in
                            the effect may yet be made, by a different arrangement of the air, or
                            tune, in the parts where the children join, by not merely taking the
                            creble notes, to which the melody is by no means confined. For when the
                            composer thus formed his score, he naturally supposed that the different
                            voices would in general be pretty equally arranged, and that therefore
                            it would be of little consequence whether the principal air was in the
                            treble or any other part. Could he however have foreseen that, upon some
                            future occasions, there would be about two thousand trebles, (supposing
                            only a third part of the children to sing in these chorusses,) to about
                            three or four tenors and basses, or had the present annual meeting and
                            performance been instituted in his time, he would undoubtedly in the
                            full chorus have thrown the air as much as possible into that <pb id="p11-40" n="40"/> part, which cannot so justly be said to
                            predominate over the others, as to drown and annihilate them. My
                            principal allusion is to the first three bars of the last movement of
                            the Coronation-Anthem, "God save the King,"
                            &amp;c, and the same as repeated towards the end, which as a loyal
                                <hi rend="i">exclamation</hi> in unison, appears striking enough,
                            but can hardly be called singing, being nearly all upon one note. As,
                            therefore, the air is here evidently sung by the counter-tenors and
                            tenors, supported by the violins in the octave above, I should propose
                            in these three bars, the boys taking the counter-tenor part, and the
                            girls the tenor in the octave above, or in unison with the second violin
                            part. And this, being in fact but one bar three times repeated, need not
                            startle those who with great reason object to the children being taught
                            to sing in parts, to which I would make this the sole exception. In like
                            manner, as at the repetition of the same words in the key of A at the
                            17th bar, the principal air is in the tenor part; I would have the
                            children taught to sing that part in the octave above, instead of the
                            proper treble part, as being likely to produce a more striking
                            effect.<lb/> In other parts of the Coronation-Anthem, and in the
                            Hallelujah chorus, similar improvements may be made, by selecting such
                            parts from the score, as have most air or time in them, for the children
                            to sing, either in unison or in the octave above, as may best suit their
                            voices.<lb/> I have yet a fourth observation to mention which I made,
                            viz, the want of an organ of more power in the bass to qualify the
                            prodigious strength of treble; although Mr. Attwood, by his full and
                            judicious accompaniment, made the most that he could of that, (upon all
                            other occasions as it may be reckoned,) compleat and noble instrument.
                            Indeed, since these annual meetings have been established, one cannot
                            but lament that the proposal of Mr. Renatus Harris, mentioned in the
                            552d number of the Spectator, of erecting an organ of the greatest
                            powers and dimensions over the great west door of the cathedral, has not
                            since been carried into execution. The present organ, however, might be
                            enlarged for this occasion, by the exchange of the trumpet stop for one
                            of more power than the present, and addition of a double trumpet bass,
                            with likewise (if room should be found,) a clarion, or octave trumpet.
                            With these powerful reed stops, and additional voices proposed, there
                            would be something considerable left when the childrens’
                            voices cease in the Coronation Anthem, &amp;c. and in the full
                            chorus the great force of the trebles would be qualified and contrasted
                            by a bass bearing some proportion to it, and a grandeur would be given
                            to the whole, which would wonderfully improve the general effect. Should
                            however the additions to the organ here proposed, be not found
                            practicable or expedient, then perhaps one or two bass trombones, used
                            merely when all the children sing, might answer the purpose.<lb/> I
                            cannot conclude without paying my small tribute of approbation to Mr.
                            Page, as well for the very great pains he must have taken, and time he
                            must have bestowed, in preparing the children at the different schools
                            so as to enable them to perform by ear, and without the least knowledge
                            of the science, with such great accuracy and precision; as for his
                            clear, distinct, and animated manner of conducting so large an
                            assemblage of voices, actuated as it were by one mind; thereby producing
                            an effect that is probably not equalled in Europe.<lb/>

                    <p>This publication consists of the complete text of Richard Edwards’
                        1797 edition of Edward Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>,
                        accompanied by reproductions, reduced 35% from the originals, of
                        Blake’s forty three engravings, as well as editorial
                        material—a two-page introduction, a thirteen page critical
                        commentary, and a two-page annotated bibliography. Though the 1797 <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> isn’t scarce—copies
                        appear each season at auction and in booksellers’
                        catalogues—it has become increasingly costly, and its importance
                        for any study of Blake’s art, as well as its intrinsic beauty,
                        have made a facsimile desirable. There is still such a need, but the present
                        edition, along with the descriptive bibliographic notes in Easson and
                        Essick’s <hi rend="i">William Blake: Book Illustrator</hi>, is a
                        useful substitute for the original.</p>
                    <p>Let’s consider the quality of the reproductions in the present
                        edition before turning to the usefulness of the supplementary material and
                        commentary. Something of the compelling beauty of Blake’s
                        original engravings was conveyed in the <hi rend="i">Library Companion</hi>
                        (1824) by Thomas Frognall Dibdin who recounted how "amidst the wild
                        uproar of the wintry elements—when piping winds are howling for
                        entrance round every corner of the turretted chamber" he loved to
                        read "the text of Young which has been embellished by the pencil of
                        Blake." Scale was an arresting feature of Blake’s
                        originals—especially when viewed next to Stothard’s or
                        even Westall’s designs. The reduction in the present edition
                        makes the overall page appear busy, gray and even claustrophobic. The airy
                        personification of Night on page 1, for example, has no room to soar. The
                        figure of the sleepless shepherd-poet becomes more decorative than engaging.
                        And when Death, with his emblems, appears to the sleepless poet, on page 7,
                        the urgency conveyed by the original scene is absent. Airy supernaturalish,
                        dynamic confrontations, the recognition of giant forms who inhabit at once
                        several dimensions—these aspects, ineffables perhaps, are
                        distorted by reduction. Of course, to claim that on page [17]
                        Time’s scythe—in the original as long as this
                        reader’s forearm—is decoratively tame rather than
                        menacing is rather subjective. But when, as on page 37, in the ambiguous
                        depiction of Christ as a good Samaritan, the mood of a scene is conveyed by
                        hanging that scene on a vast tree, which expresses the oppressiveness of the
                        vegetable world, then diminution becomes a critical element of
                        interpretation.</p>
                    <p>Two last niggling points about the printing of this Dover edition. Because of
                        the complex and remarkable way the 1797 <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> was
                        printed, there are numerous variations in the copies of the first edition,
                        and my compariosn of this reproduction with the 1797 edition in the Toronto
                        Public Library turned up an anticipated number of variations, such as the
                        presence of inscriptions on different pages. An unexpected differenc,
                        however, was found in the use of borders in the reproduction. We can see
                        this clearly on page 24, where the word "Pub<hi rend="s">d</hi>." is cut off in Essick’s original inscription,
                        which should, therefore, begin "June" at the exact
                        lefthand edge of the page. Instead, there’s a border of
                        approximately 7/16 of an inch. Such borders—appearing along the
                        bottom and the top, as well as, more irregularly, along the inner and outer
                        edges—make Blake’s designs, which no longer occupy the
                        whole space, rather picturesque, as borders and frames tend to do. Christ
                        triumphant, page [65], who leaps up in the original design, is now tamed.
                        Finally, although the tonal quality is generally not problematic, on page 80
                        the feeling of reflected light on the man who prays by the seashore, and the
                        delicate gradations in tone in the whole engraving, have disappeared, so
                        that the man, who looks awestruck in the original, appears fearful in the
                        reproduction.</p>
                    <p>The editorial material—introduction, commentary, and
                        bibliography—is excellent, concise, and sensitive to
                        Blake’s iconography. And it also acknowledges Young’s
                        importance for Blake. The plate-by-plate commentary is non-partisan and
                        stimulating. In discussing, for example, the hunter Nimrod on page 70,
                        Essick and Labelle point to both the Genesis reference and iconographic
                        resemblences in Blake’s later and earlier work. Similarly, they
                        present several translations for the Hebrew letters on the scroll of the
                        King of Terrors, page 63. Yet, partly as a result of brevity, and partly
                        because of problems in their critical stance, a few "little
                        monsters" of caution appear.</p>
                    <p>Even had we not Blake’s enormous output of <hi rend="i">Night
                            Thought</hi> designs as evidence, we need to assume that Blake respected
                        the poet whose work he agreed to illustrate. And the poem enjoyed a
                        considerable contemporary reputation. The <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>
                        was an international best-seller <hi rend="i">and</hi> a major artistic
                        force—influencing Goethe’s <hi rend="i">Werther</hi>
                        and Klopstock’s <hi rend="i">Messiah.</hi> Burns quoted the poem
                        in his letters; Coleridge and Wordsworth echoed it in verse. I think that
                        Essick and La Belle overstress the illustrations where Blake criticizes
                        Young. And when Blake does criticize, it is quite legitimate in his task as
                        an illustrator. To criticize is not to disparage. On page 72, for example,
                        there is a moving hymn by Young in which he would "drink the spirit
                        of the golden day." Surely here the poet has not, as the editors
                        contend, "forgot the visionary themes of salvation and
                        resurrection." And the editors might allow that on page 80 the poet
                        is rejecting the "nameless HE" for Christ, a position
                        Blake would commend.</p>
                    <p>Let’s leave the question of attitude and look briefly at tactical
                        issues. First a caveat against explaining any of Blake’ designs
                        with quotations from his poetry of a later period. Essick and Labelle
                        unnecessarily quote <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> plate 26, to <pb id="p11-42" n="42"/> explicate the title page to the first Night; also against
                        assuming Blake’s "iconographic consistency" (p.
                        xiii). How would the editors explain the cup held by the child about to be
                        cut down by Time, on page 26? Such a cup is often associated in Blake with
                        bacchic figures and with the Scarlet Whore. Hence, it is ordinarily a
                        sinister icon. Odd that it appears in the hands of a child. It is true that
                        the editors express a mild reservation about iconographic consistency (p.
                        viii), but the assumption should be that Blake adapted his images to his
                        context.</p>
                    <p>The editors’ commendable compression of iconographic material has
                        led to small omissions and overstatements. The deisgn, on page 90, of Christ
                        touching an "afflicted" man is said to be "almost
                        identical" to the frontispiece for Blake’s <hi rend="i">There Is No Natural Religion</hi>, second series, and to those two
                        figures in the lower right corner of "The Divine Image" in
                            <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence.</hi> The "same basic
                        motif" is pointed out in "The Chimney Sweeper" in
                            <hi rend="i">Innocence.</hi> Yet, among these designs the editors should
                        have drawn an important distinction. In "The Chimney
                        Sweeper" and the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> designs the two
                        figures touch; in "The Divine Image" and <hi rend="i">There Is No Natural Religion</hi> they do not. Hence, while all four
                        designs share the theme of resurrection, in only two is there a touch which
                        humanizes the action.</p>
                    <p>The process of iconographic selection is always complex. Very rarely in this
                        edition does that selection appear indelicate. It does seem significant,
                        however, that the "spiritual presences,"
                        "Angels," on page 93, are wingless. In the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> Blake often uses winged creatures for ascension,
                        and wingless beings for visitations.</p>
                    <p>I think that it is more often in the designs with clear Biblical referents
                        (particularly pages [43], 72, 80, 88) that the editors’
                        interpretations seem to demand the reader’s critical attention.
                        On the title page for the third Night, the woman clothed in the sun is
                        pregnant. Through her pregnancy she may escape the endless revolutions of
                        time, turn time to eternity. (Nonetheless, the verso in the water colors
                        shows her even more a prisoner.) On page 88, where Jacob wrestles with an
                        "angel," it is the equality of man and God that Blake
                        seems to stress, an equality quite consistent with the Biblical account and
                        with Blake’s emphasis throughout the <hi rend="i">Night
                            Thoughts.</hi> (It’s an emphasis which also shows
                        Blake’s preparedness for the Bible illustrations done for
                        Butts.)</p>
                    <p>Can we offer an overall interpretation for the <hi rend="i">Night
                            Thoughts</hi> engravings? The editors don’t suggest one,
                        though many of their comments are interpretative. The repetition of images
                        and of the figures of Death, Time, and Christ do unify the designs and
                        suggest, as Fuseli wrote of Blake’s designs for
                        Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>, that they "form of
                        themselves a most interesting Poem." With one exception all of the
                        Christ images appear in the fourth Night. Thus, the grouping of the figures
                        suggests a progression from the world of Time and Death to a world informed
                        by Christ—a progression in keeping with the movement of the
                        poem.</p>
                    <p>Since the Dover edition is for the general reader, its annotated bibliography
                        is quite properly short. It is short as well because there’s been
                        little work done on the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts.</hi> The major studies
                        are listed, though some interesting brief mentions of the <hi rend="i">Night
                            Thoughts</hi>, such as John Grant’s in <hi rend="i">Blake
                            Newsletter</hi> 13, pp. 23-24, are omitted. The first entry in the
                        chronological bibliography is out of order. If the editors wish to consider
                        Thomas Edwards as their first entry, his name should be listed, along with
                        the titles of his catalogues. I must quarrel as well with the fifth entry,
                        which dismisses Adeline Butterworth’s <hi rend="i">William Blake,
                            Mystic.</hi> Butterworth was, after all, the first to reproduce both the
                        engravings and the full text of the first two Nights. Her reproductions of
                        the engravings are by no means "poor-quality"; the paper
                        stock on which they are printed is superior to that of the Dover
                        edition.</p>
                    <p>Despite its minor failings, many of them deriving, as I have suggested, from
                        compression and the exeqencies of commercial printing, Essick and La Belle
                        have performed a service for students of Blake. Like Robespierre, we can all
                        go to the guillotine with the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, now
                        "embellished by the pencil of Blake," in our pockets.</p>

                    <p>This new edition of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, issued
                        as it is at a reasonable price, marks an important step in making
                        Blake’s work available to the ordinary reader in the form in
                        which he meant it to be seen. For the Blake specialist who already has
                        access to existing facsimiles through a good library it will serve a further
                        important purpose. In recent years it has become clear that a new dimension
                        of Blake’s work opens when one looks at the various copies which
                        he executed throughout his life, since almost all of them show interesting
                        variations from one another. It is in some ways a subsidiary enterprise,
                        since there is no evidence that these various executions betray any
                        fundamental change of mind about a book, once constructed, but they can
                        still give evidence of the continuing processes of his mind: the themes
                        which he may now wish to emphasize by rearrangement, by the insertion of an
                        additional plate or plates, or by the different perspectives on a text which
                        can be given through the choice of different colors or the emphasis on
                        particular visual motifs.</p>
                    <p>The pioneers in this enterprise have been David Erdman and his associates,
                        who have described such variations in detail, but there is a limit to what
                        an individual scholar can do, particularly when, as must often happen, he is
                        forced to carry some differences in his head from one copy to another. It is
                        even more difficult to convey them to other readers <pb id="p11-43" n="43"/>
                        through the printed description. The slide lecture (as David Erdman has
                        found) is often the best way of communicating such discoveries.</p>
                    <p>The publication of this edition marks an important step in remedying this
                        situation, since the copy it reproduces, copy I (Keynes-Wolf) in the
                        Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, often thought to be the finest of all, is one
                        that has not so far been available. (It could not be produced as the
                        original Trianon Press facsimile, since the Fitzwilliam, for understandable
                        reasons, has been unwilling to send its copies to Paris for the dismantling
                        which would be inevitable under that process.) As a result of this
                        initiative, a scholar anywhere in the world now has the chance of comparing
                        three versions: this one; copy H (Keynes-Wolf) in the Fitzwilliam
                        (reproduced in Max Plowman’s 1927 facsimile); and the Rosenwald
                        copy, reproduced in the Trianon Press facsimile. No printed description can
                        reproduce the experience of comparing say, the slightly sombre effect of
                        copy H, with its cavernous enclosures here and there, and the brighter,
                        rainbow effect of copy I.</p>
                    <p>The new edition is reproduced with an introduction, a reading text and an
                        arrangement of the reproduction so that two pages of reproduction are
                        regularly interspersed with two of commentary, allowing the plates to appear
                        facing one another as in the original. This is the most satisfactory way of
                        reproducing within the traditional book format, though it might be
                        worthwhile to experiment with an arrangement which would make it possible
                        for pages of interpretation to be pulled out <hi rend="i">beyond</hi> the
                        plates and so to be read side by side with the open text.</p>
                    <p>The commentary, as we have come to expect from Sir Geoffrey Keynes, is
                        uncluttered, clear and very much to the point. He wastes little time over
                        previous interpretations, with the important exception of David
                        Erdman’s 1973 essay on the interlinear drawings. He is, indeed,
                        brisk to the point of being almost cavalier with his predecessors: of the
                        two books he does mention, Erdman’s <hi rend="i">Blake: Prophet
                            against Empire</hi> is given only the second part of its title, together
                        with a date which is that of the second, revised edition, no mention being
                        made of the first, while Sabri-Tabrizi is turned into Fabri-Tabrizi.</p>
                    <p>The problem with any running commentary on Blake is that it cannot give the
                        reader the initial bearings that he needs before entering the world of the
                        prophetic books. Simple identifications of Blake’s personages
                        with human qualities or physical functions will not normally do unless the
                        reader has some grasp of the larger pattern of what is going on. I do not
                        think there is a simple answer to this problem: each reader has to match
                        readings of the larger interpretations against scrutiny of the text itself
                        until he finds a reading that works for him. So far as running commentary
                            <hi rend="i">is</hi> possible, however, this one is good. Some important
                        points are missed out: the reader will not learn anywhere that the Memorable
                        Fancies are satirical versions of Swedenborg’s Memorable
                        Relations, for example. Some of the identifications strike one as
                        over-simplistic: to see Rintrah simply as "Wrath," for
                        instance, is to suggest a kind of crude animism which is not characteristic
                        of Blake’s work. I am also unhappy with references to
                        "materialism" and "the spiritual" in
                        commentaries on Blake, for when run together they suggest adherence to a
                        dichotomy between the material and the spiritual which was foreign to his
                        purposes. When, for example, the illustration at the head of plate 11,
                        showing various figures of land and sea, is described as "nature in
                        its spiritual forms," I find it more natural to refer to the text
                        immediately beneath ("The Ancient Poets animated all sensible
                        objects with Gods or Geniuses," etc.) which it seems to be
                        illustrating very closely. Blake’s spirits interpenetrate the
                        material to an extraordinary and unaccustomed degree, drastically changing
                        the meaning of the word "spiritual" from conventional
                        usage.</p>
                    <p>One or two other disagreements may be briefly noted. Keynes interprets
                        "Now is the dominion of Edom and the return of Adam into
                        Paradise" as meaning that Adam has already returned into Paradise;
                        I would read it more in the Biblical form which would suggest "Now
                        is the time for . . . ": that is, as an announcement of
                        potentiality and anticipation rather than a statement of achieved fact. On
                        plate 11 he remarks that "a serpent was not infrequently
                        Blake’s symbol for the priest of organized religion."
                        Although the Prester Serpent of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> might
                        support such an identification, I cannot offhand think of other instances
                        where it is explicit. The serpent is always, primarily, Blake’s
                        figure for energy (this is one of the few instances where a straightforward
                        identification does work); only a fallen, sneaking serpent would do for the
                        organized priesthood. Similarly I would not agree that the male figure
                        shackled in flames on page 4 "can only be Blake’s
                        devil": he can also, for example, be the male shackled under the
                        Law. In such cases, Keynes’s own <hi rend="i">caveat</hi> on
                        interpretations of the interlinear decorations—that they are
                        "not always easy and must be regarded as sometimes
                        conjectural"—may profitably be extended to
                        interpretations of the text as well.</p>
                    <p>The interpretations of the interlinear figures just referred to are, on the
                        other hand, one of the most valuable features of the new edition. The main
                        problem is to know whether in some cases they are straightforward
                        illustrations of the neighboring texts, or counterpointing images of energy
                        (as sometimes seems to be the case in the Song of Liberty). Cautious as one
                        has to be with Blake’s left/right symbolism, something of the
                        sort seems to be at work here, since figures on the right are often under
                        the dominion of reason, with a greater emphasis on energy as one looks along
                        to the left.</p>
                    <p>What of the reproduction? Arnold Fawcus, of the Trianon Press, states in his
                        foreword—"The result, we feel, is as close to the
                        original as can be obtained by a photo-mechanical
                        process"—which is fair. The blurb on the dust-jacket,
                        however, claims that the reproduced plates are "of an accuracy and
                        delicacy which Blake himself would have admired"—which
                        is at the very least questionable—and speaks of their
                        "excellence"—which is certainly too strong a
                        word. The editor, likewise, claims that the reproduction is "in all
                        respects . . . most satisfactory"—which again is
                        somewhat misleading—and is at pains to dispel doubts about the
                        accuracy of register in the lettering which are in fact well
                        founded—at least on the highest standards.</p>
                    <pb id="p11-44" n="44"/>
                    <p>For the plain fact (which will no doubt come as a surprise to many readers)
                        is that the facsimile reproduction which H. John Dent made of the other
                        Fitzwilliam copy of the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> fifty years ago, though
                        by no means perfect, is a good deal closer to its original than is this one.
                        In Dent’s facsimile, colors are sometimes darker than the
                        original, Blake’s brown is a little too orange and occasionally a
                        background tint is out; but in other respects the rendering is extremely
                        faithful. This is less so in the present case. The most glaring difference
                        is that Blake used gilt on many of the plates, which both added a touch of
                        subtle brilliance and pointed the imagery of energy. It was no doubt
                        impossible to manage this with a reproduction based on photography (though,
                        again, Dent managed it for his facsimile in 1927), but the omission should
                        at least have been noted somewhere in the edition; I can find no mention of
                        it. I have also noted a number of further differences, primarily in
                        coloring, from the original: this is not intended in any way to be an
                        exhaustive list, simply a note of those differences which have struck me
                        most forcibly in comparing the plates.</p>

                        copy is on any terms a beautiful book, reasonable value at the price and one
                        which most people, including myself, will be glad to have on their shelves.
                        For many purposes, and especially that of comparison with other reproduced
                        versions, mentioned earlier, it will be invaluable. The point at issue is
                        simply that the imprint of the Trianon Press, along with the superlatives
                        used in descriptions of the reproductions, may give many readers the
                        impression that this book is of the same quality as that of the limited
                        editions. An extra qualifying word here or there would have been enough to
                        guard against such a false impression. This reservation aside, Arnold
                        Fawcus, Sir Geoffrey Keynes and the Oxford University Press are to be
                        congratulated (— can hardly, indeed, be sufficiently praised) for
                        bringing this book within the grasp of the ordinary reader.</p>

                        years later Blake and the Germans were given a second chance, and again it

                        Paris). It was visited by almost 30,000 people—and this is a

                    <p>The exhibition was divided into five sections: the first dealing with
                        Blake’s early work, water-colors (from the 1780s) and the first
                        of the illuminated books—including an imcomplete copy of the two
                            <hi rend="i">Religion</hi> series (Victoria &amp; Albert Museum,
                        London; not in the <hi rend="i">Census</hi>), an incomplete copy of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (private collection, Great Britain; also not in the
                            <hi rend="i">Census</hi>), and <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and
                            Hell</hi> (copy K). The second section was dedicated to the prophetic
                        books and centered around three main points: copy K of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, five of the 1795 color-prints, and copy B together with
                        several proofs from <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (including those from
                        Canberra). Section III consisted mostly of examples taken from
                        Blake’s Bible illustrations for Butts. In a fourth division
                        Blake’s work as an illustrator of other authors’ works
                        was documented by a copy of Mary Wollstonecraft’s <hi rend="i">Original Stories</hi>, and an edition of the engraved designs for <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> (newly acquired by the Hamburger
                        Kunsthalle). These were supplemented by a selection of ten of the
                        water-colors from the British Museum, a copy of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> illustrations, and, among other designs illustrating
                        Milton’s poems, the complete <hi rend="i">Paradise Regained</hi>
                        series from the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. The last part of the
                        exhibition was devoted to Blake’s artistic output in his last
                        decade; the "Ghost of a Flea" (two pencil drawings), the
                        Virgil woodcuts, the <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of Job</hi>, and
                        twelve of the Dante designs (seven from the Melbourne collection) were
                        shown. One of the highlights of the exhibition was Bindman’s
                        successful bringing together of the four consecutive illustrations for
                        Purgatorio XXVII-XXXII as originally planned by Blake. This was certainly an
                        extraordinary experience for the careful observer, nowadays not easy to
                        achieve by viewing any of the various collections possessing some of the 102
                        water-colors for the <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy.</hi>
                        <ref target="n71" type="note">4</ref> With the supplementary showing of the Blake Trust
                        facsimiles of the illuminated books ("William Blake. Poet, Printer,
                        Prophet") all the necessary ingredients were offered to awaken
                        "the interest which all men . . . must take in the contemplation of
                        such a character." (It might, however, be regretted that the
                        commercial engravings of Blake were not represented.) Now we all know that
                        the contemplation of Blake’s works does not easily nor
                        necessarily lead to the "right" understanding of his
                        extraordinary productions; to lend the visitor a helping hand, a thoroughly
                        prepared catalog written by David Bindman, Werner Hofmann, Johannes
                        Kleinstueck and Siegmar Holsten accompanied the exhibition.<ref target="n72" type="note">5</ref>

                            <hi rend="s">4</hi> On the other hand it was just the more
                            disappointing to see the twelve water-colors hung completely out of
                            order in the rooms of the Städelsches Kunstinstitut
                            (Frankfurt) for socalled "aesthetic" reasons.
                            According to the "Städel-aesthetic-theory"
                            strong colors such as red, blue, green, and black ("Dante
                            Running from the Three Beasts," "The Schismatics and
                            Sowers of Discords," etc.) have their rightful place at the
                            head of exhibition rooms. In particular such colors are even more
                            stengthened in their impact when viewed—almost
                            tryptichlike—left and right of the Städel library
                            door, where six of the water-colors found their home, the rest being
                            delegated to a more shadowy corner cabinet. By this method
                            "Beatrice on the Car, Dante and Matilda" (British
                            Museum) again was separated from "Beatrice Addressing Dante
                            from the Car" (Tate Gallery, London)—this time not
                            by a few miles, but by a massive pillar on which the viewer was shown
                            "The Stygian Lake" (National Gallery of Victoria,
                            Melbourne) illustrating Inferno VII; "The Laborious Passage
                            along the Rocks," Inferno XXIV, was next to "The Queen
                            of Heaven in Glory," Paradiso XL-XLI. So the misunderstandings
                            at the Städelsches Kunstinstitut continued. The major concern
                            of Dr. Gallwitz, director at the Frankfurt Gallery, was the presentation
                            of a "harmonious overall effect," and this is a good
                            example of the bad influence of certain museum methods on the display of
                            an artist’s works. Just the more one certainly has to praise
                            Hofmann’s attempt at Hamburg to arrange the prints and
                            paintings according to Blake’s own plans and thus to bring
                            the artist’s intentions as close as possible to the
                            public.</note>

                        Poet" (pp. 31-37), a conglomerate of misreadings I had thought
                        virtually impossible nowadays,<ref target="n73" type="note">6</ref> this
                        catalog is a fine piece of introduction to Blake’s thought, and
                        with its 506 plates it makes up a most useful reference book for his art.
                        Throughout the work David Bindman succeeds in what seems to have been his
                        primary aim: a short but not at all oversimplified interpretation of
                        Blake’s iconography is supplied for the visitor, assume to be
                        someone who does not know anything about Blake. Here lies the great merit of
                        this endeavor.<ref target="n74" type="note">7</ref> Nevertheless, one must
                        criticize the catalog as well as the exhibition in two respects. First, the
                        author finds no way to bind an objective appreciation of the
                        "purely" visual qualities of Blake’s prints,
                        drawings and paintings with their complex iconographic meaning within
                        Blake’s mythopoetic systems; that is to say, he argues on a
                        rather abstract level, which exists <hi rend="i">seemingly</hi> isolated
                        from the <hi rend="i">formal</hi> difficulties presented to the unschooled
                        viewer of Blake. For example, discussing Blake’s
                        "Newton" color-print Bindman writes that the
                        "posture, as Blunt has pointed out, refers back to the figure of
                            <hi rend="i">Abias</hi> on the Sistine Chapel ceiling" (p. 139,
                        cat. no. 61), forgetting however to provide the reader with an explanation
                        of <hi rend="i">why</hi> Blake <hi rend="i">had to use</hi> this scheme. In
                        the same context he interprets the compasses as a "familiar symbol
                        of materialism" (ibid.), but the power of Blake’s use of
                        this pictorial sign derives from the artist’s negation of the
                        formerly positive meaning of this symbol as well as from its appearance
                        within a rigidly geometrical composition. Secondly—and this I
                        think is indissolubly connected to the first
                        point—Bindman’s otherwise fine comments border on the
                        incorrect when presented almost completely without reference to the
                        political and social implications of Blake’s visionary art.
                        Though he mentions Erdman’s <hi rend="i">Prophet Against
                            Empire</hi>, he does not <hi rend="i">seem</hi> to have a very high
                        estimate of the importance of this standard work, when he sums up a very
                        short paragraph on Blake’s revolutionary sympathies with this
                        lapidary sentence: "Many people in Blake’s circle were
                        also political radicals, and others like him eventually sought spiritual
                        comfort, not in the hope of the renewal of this world, but in the world
                        beyond" (p. 112). I cannot agree that Blake’s search for
                        "spiritual comfort" necessarily had to exclude
                        "the hope of the renewal of this world." With many other
                        critics I would say that this search rather began in the hope for an
                        apocalyptic renovation of this world. The expression of frustration and
                        disillusionment that Bindman alludes to could only stem from
                        Blake’s daily environment, from his society and his times.
                        Further, the religious, visionary and political thoughts are interwoven in
                        his art in such a way, that it must be a vain pursuit to disentangle them
                        and thus try to decompose the wholeness of Blake’s productions
                        into political and religious parts. Yet it was refreshing to hear David
                        Bindman speaking at length of "the rebel in Blake" in his
                        opening address both at Hamburg and Frankfurt; apparently he is well aware
                        of the importance of the discussion of these areas when viewing
                        Blake’s art. It is too bad that he excluded them from his catalog
                        text. On the other hand, it would certainly be unfair to blame David Bindman
                        for all this; in fact, I believe that in the short time he was given to
                        compile the enormous amount of information necessary, he could not have
                        achieved much more. <note id="n73">

                            appears to be unaware of the frontiers opened up in Blake scholarship
                            within the last thirty years. The only recent book he seems to have
                            known when writing his critique is David G. Gillham’s last

                            Gillham’s work: "It seems to me interesting that a

                            Bindman’s catalog-entries into German, was given a chance to

                    <p>Yet here we come to the general dilemma that makes me stress these two points
                        of criticim more than <pb id="p11-46" n="46"/> the many positive things that
                        might be said about the catalog. The problem I am interested in drawing
                        attention to will bother us again and again when faced with presenting
                        Blake’s work to the public. The failure of the German exhibitions
                        and the catalog—"failure" also because most of
                        the visitors were rather irritated and could find no way <hi rend="i">into</hi> the works of art displayed and thus no way to experience
                        their potential of broadening one’s consciousness—is
                        probably the result of two major problems. First, art historians until now
                        (with few exceptions) have left the task of interpreting Blake’s
                        visual productions mostly to literary critics, who—fair enough,
                        one has to admit—rather <hi rend="i">used</hi> Blake’s
                        illuminations and paintings because of their explanatory value as a kind of
                        visual commentary or complementary code for the understanding of his poetic
                        creations. The problem of form—not just the question of what is
                        symbolized by the object perceived (a strong young man rising out of a sea
                        of flames = Orc), but the question of how that object is visually organized
                        and of the meaning of these "minute particulars" in their
                        context—this problem seldom appeared to the literary critics, and
                        the art historian dealing with Blake until now seems to have been almost
                        compelled to choose the iconographic approach.<ref target="n75" type="note">8</ref> It has long been generally accepted that Blake’s
                        work as an engraver and painter is much more than a literal illustration of
                        his writings—this finally has to be taken seriously. In the
                        future more attention should be paid to the specially visual qualities of
                        his art (and their inalienable necessity as such in a given context). This,

                        "content" of his designs and enable us to reach the
                        visitors of a Blake exhibition much more easily. We certainly cannot leave
                        the viewer of Blake’s art—or the reader of his
                        poetry—alone with his subjective "taste."
                        Instead, we have to develop new concepts for exhibiting and teaching Blake
                        that try to integrate the viewer’s and the reader’s
                        first-sight experiences as well as "appeal to the Public."
                        The hermeticism of the artist’s visual worlds <hi rend="i">itself</hi> has to become a problem for the scholar, the student, and
                        the visitor in the museum. Only then might we make sure that
                        Blake’s "‘failure’ was but for a
                            season."<ref target="n76" type="note">9</ref> Is it not our
                        responsibility to bring back—or rather to help establish for the
                        first time—that "visionary faculty" Blake
                        demanded from his public not less than from the artist
                        himself—the ability to really <hi rend="i">perceive</hi> that
                        "more is meant than meets the eye"? In Hamburg and
                        Frankfurt one could observe the necessity of developing a didactic program
                        for the understanding of Blake’s art. Here the audience had no
                        means of deceiving itself through acquaintance with some of this strange
                        character’s poems, as might often be the case (or not) in
                        English-speaking countries. By now <hi rend="i">we</hi> all know that
                        William Blake was not simply a madman—does the public know as
                        well? I fear we are deceiving ourselves, in fact, when we believe this
                        discussion to be over just because <hi rend="i">we</hi> know. <note id="n75">
                            <hi rend="s">8</hi> Anne Mellor, in her recent book on <hi rend="i">Blake’s Human Form Divine</hi> (Berkeley, Los Angeles
                            &amp; London: Univ. of California Press, 1974), put forward similar
                            questions and many hints towards the answers. I do not quite agree with
                            W. J. T. Mitchell’s statement that "most of the
                            studies of Blake in the last twenty years have addressed themselves to
                            the question of form;" to my knowledge no one has ever even
                            tried to approach Blake’s art with such art historical
                            criteria as utilized by Mellor. In spite of the mistakes in her work
                            that are justly criticized by Mitchell, I still feel that the central
                            problem discussed makes this an important study of Blake’s
                            visual art (for Mitchell’s review see <hi rend="i">Blake

                    <p>With a thousand Orcs throughout the cities of Hamburg and
                        Frankfurt—the poster for the exhibition was based on <hi rend="i">America</hi> 10—the event prompted a massive demand for
                        information on Blake. Thus, many a German journalist suddenly had to face
                        the task of writing an article on an artist he possibly had never heard of
                        before. The outcome you might already guess: most of the numerous reviews of
                        the exhibition and the catalog in German newspapers and magazines can easily
                        be forgotten by the serious critic, if he is not specifically interested in
                        the reception of Blake’s art and his reputation in Germany. Sadly
                        enough, the standard of Henry Crabb Robinson’s essay from 1811 is
                        but seldom reached in 1975, though many of that author’s
                        prejudices are reproduced once more (Robinson’s article is
                        reprinted in the catalog, pp. 75-83).<ref target="n77" type="note">10</ref>
                        Other Blake activities connected with the showing of his works included

                        extensive) bibliographical data. But the German edition contains only a

                        Schacherl’s German translation of Blake’s text, which
                        is often quite precarious in its freedom, takes up the space occupied in the
                        Oxford edition by a much more satisfying analysis by Keynes of
                        Blake’s prose and designs, based chiefly on the study of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> by David V. Erdman and others that were
                        published in the Keynes festschrift (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973, pp.

                        the German. This austerity and Keynes’s occasionally light

                    <p>The "Afterword" by Werner Hofmann (pp. 105-15) provides the
                        so-called common reader with an introduction to Blake’s ideas as
                        developed in the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, and to his "infernal
                        methods" of printing, which is more likely to satisfy the
                        reader’s needs than Keynes’s. Hofmann addresses
                        himself to the non-specialist; he touches briefly on the socio-historical
                        background setting, draws attention to the eschatological, millenarial
                        current in Blake’s art, and to some of his central pictorial
                        motifs employed in the <hi rend="i">Songs.</hi> He explains to his reader
                        that Blake’s strange printing process was a necessary act of
                        refusal for an artist who did not want to create works of
                        "comfortable familiarity" (p. 107), for an artist who had
                        to work his way through a printing house in hell to find a method of
                        production appropriate for his emancipatory message.<ref target="n80" type="note">13</ref> Significantly, it is Werner Hofmann’s
                        essay on "The Fulfillment of Time" ("Die
                        Erfüllung der Zeit") in the exhibition catalog (pp.
                        11-30) which approaches somewhat the questions raised in the first part of
                        this review; and significantly, Hofmann comes closest, through consideration
                        of the forms as well as the iconographic motifs employed by Blake, to an
                        evaluation of the possible meaning of "visionary art"
                        today.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, this volume has to be judged much more cautiously in
                        regards to the accuracy of its reproductions than the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> facsimile. The glossy high quality paper used here is a
                        far cry from Blake’s. Of the two framing lines on thirty-eight
                        plates of the original, only one is to be seen. Blake’s foliation
                        has been cut off and is replaced by a printed pagination that does not at
                        all correspond with the plate numbers. Ironically here the plates are
                        reproduced on both the recto and verso of each leaf, while in the original
                        most of them are printed on one side of the sheet only, and the size of the
                        facsimile pages is different from the original. In addition, the brilliant
                        colors and the gold used by Blake for a number of plates in copy T are
                        hardly to be imagined when looking at this reproduction. Yet, what can one
                        justly expect from a color-facsimile at about $3.50?</p>
                    <p>It is this that we must aim at: the actualization of visionary art and its
                        consequent realization for the reader of Blake’s poetry as well
                        as the visitor to an exhibition of his artistic work such as those held in
                        Hamburg and Frankfurt last year. Otherwise we will be trapped in the
                        self-sufficiency of "the wearisome industry of source-hunting, of

                            Netherlands, and Switzerland are also included). Nonetheless, one might
                            find some wheat among the chaff, even among the shorter essays (see

                            included here, and that the second part is almost complete. Not
                            mentioned are the many two- or three-line referenes which merely gave
                            the dates of the exhibition, opening-hours etc.; also excluded are books
                            dealing only incidentally with Blake while discussing a different or
                            larger subject (e. g., general introductions into the history of English
                            painting and some important Fuseli publications are not listed here).
                            These omissions might be bettered in a future list of Continental
                            material relevant for the study of Blake, the poetry, art, and history
                            of his age.</p>

                    <p>In the summer of 1973, when work took me to Äbo, Finland, I paused
                        to relish the bizarre neo-classical splendors of Leningrad, and while I was
                        there I went to the enormous M. E. Saltykov-Shchedrin State Public Library,
                        where Lenin had worked. It is an enormous building, housing, it is said,
                        some 20,000,000 works, and is rather difficult of access, partly because the
                        entrance is hard to find. Inside, one is asked for a pass—or at
                        least I assumed that is what we were asked for. My daughter, who speaks some
                        Russian, managed to get us in touch with Miss Fanny Barnofsky, who very
                        kindly took us up to the catalogues. I had hoped to look up Blake, but I was
                        prevented by my total ignorance of the Russian alphabet from even finding
                        the correct drawer.<ref target="n82" type="note">1</ref> I was about to give
                        up in self-disgust, when the head of the catalogue department came up to
                        help me and, on finding that I just wanted to discover what non-English
                        works they had on William Blake, very generously said that he would have
                        such a list compiled for me. On my protesting (not very convincingly, I
                        fear) that I couldn’t possibly allow him to undertake so much
                        labor on my behalf, he told me patiently that this was a normal service of
                        the library and that, if I would simply leave my address, the list would be
                        sent to me. I acquiesced joyfully (having no fruitful alternative) and went
                        off to be shown the extraordinary riches of the library in loving detail by
                        Miss Barnofsky. <note id="n82">
                            <hi rend="s">1</hi> Note that the question of
                            how to transliterate is sometimes a difficult one and that, for example,
                            the same letter may apparently be transliterated as
                            "B" or "V"—or at least it
                            was by my learned friends.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In due course, a long list of works in the Saltykov-Shchedrin Library
                        followed me to Toronto. I had intended to use the titles to amplify the
                        revised Blake bibliography, but many of the titles proved to be irrelevant
                        for that purpose—being transliterations of single poems, reviews,
                        and the like. However, it appeared to me that most of the titles were quite
                        unknown to Western Blake scholars (or at least to me) and that such a
                        collection of Blake studies in Russian and other Slavic languages might be
                        very difficult for a Western scholar to reproduce by other means, as I can
                        testify from repeated attempts to do so.</p>
                    <p>I am, of course, only the instigator of the information here. The
                        bibliography was apparently compiled by M. V. Brestkina (Bibliographer of
                        the Saltykov-Shchedrin Library), approved by P. S. Bogomolova (Head of the
                        Bibliography Department), sent to me by I. F. Grigorieva (Chief of Foreign
                        Acquisitions &amp; International Exchange), transliterated<ref target="n82" type="note">1</ref> and translated in Toronto by Lisa
                        Schneider (and a little by Sarah Bentley), and the whole put into sensible
                        order (so far as the Slavic parts are concerned) by my friend and colleague
                        Professor Orest Rudzik.<ref target="n83" type="note">2</ref> In particular,
                        the Slavic conventions for representing titles, identifying journal
                        volume-numbers, etc., are considerably different from those in the West (or
                        at least in English), and often I could not distinguish between a publisher
                        and a journal title, or between a volume-number and the number of pages in
                        an article. For all such details I have depended upon my learned friends,
                        though doubtless my misunderstanding of their patient explanations has
                        created some needless confusions. For all this help I am profoundly
                        grateful. The most extraordinary generosity seems to me to be that shown by
                        the staff of the Saltykov-Shchedrin Library.

                    </p>
                    <p>In the following list, the primary organization is by language, the
                        sub-headings being Translations and Criticism. Under these sub-headings, the
                        order is chronological. Note that almost all essays published in 1957 were
                        probably bicentennial in inspiration. Naturally all the information has been
                        transliterated. Because some of these languages may be as puzzling to others
                        as they are to me, the titles have often been translated within square
                        brackets as well.</p>
                    <p>In terms of historical development, the Saltykov-Shchedrin Blake collection
                        in Slavic languages reveals very clear patterns.<ref target="n84" type="note">3</ref> There are eight Russian works in the pre-Communist
                        era (mostly 1896-1917), five in the Stalin years (1929-1945), a sudden dozen
                        in the bicentennial year (1957), and thereafter a small but steady stream
                        (thirty), including three books devoted entirely to Blake. The most prolific
                        translator of Blake into Russian is clearly S. I. Marshak, and the most
                        productive Blake scholars are T. N. Vasil’eva, A. A. Elistratova,
                        and E. A. Nekrasova.<ref target="n88" type="note">4</ref>

                            sent a List of Literature on William Blake’s Life and Work

                            of the U.S.S.R. (Moscow) compiled by Kushnereva and forwarded by
                            Kopylova of the Department of Bibliographical Information. The Moscow
                            list contains three translations (1900-1965) and twenty-one works of
                            criticism (1929-1970); all these are duplicates of works listed in the
                            Saltykov-Shchedrin Library in Leningrad except for a new edition of one
                            work (the 1908 Balmont translation) and a new encyclopedia entry(1962).
                            I am deeply grateful to the authorities of the Lenin State Library for
                            their generosity in sending me this information.</note>

                        publications come in 1957-58 (nineteen), with a trickle thereafter (four).
                        Of course, for these languages, especially Czech, Polish, and Rumanian, the
                        Saltykov-Shchedrin is likely to be less comprehensive and representative in
                        its holdings than for Russian works; it is notable that Estonia and
                        Lithuania, with five or six works each, are republics near Leningrad,
                        whereas all the other languages have only one or two.</p>

                        suggest to me that there are probably numerous writings about Blake
                        published in the Communist world which are unknown to Western Blake scholars
                        but that many of them are probably somewhat ephemeral, translations of
                        individual poems, bicentennial esays, and the like. I should welcome more
                        information about such works and exchanges of information with scholars in

                    <p>This bibliography deals with all doctoral dissertations concerning Blake and
                        his work between the years 1964-74 and part of 1975. Entries are taken from
                        the Fine Arts, Music, Religious Studies, and Language and Literature
                        sections of <hi rend="i">Dissertation Abstracts</hi> and <hi rend="i">Dissertation Abstracts International</hi>, 1964-1976. All the

                        given below with each entry, except in rare cases in which it must be
                        ordered directly from the University. In these cases, of course, no Xerox
                        order number is given. The list is arranged chronologically by the date of
                        the dissertation, and alphabetically within each year.</p>

                    <p>With this issue the <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi> celebrates its tenth
                        anniversary. The first issue was edited and published by Morton Paley from
                        the University of California at Berkeley in the summer of 1967. In 1970
                        Paley divided the editorial responsibilities with Morris Eaves, and the
                        production office of the <hi rend="i">Newsletter</hi> was moved to the
                        University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. With the sponsorship of the English
                        Department there, the <hi rend="i">Newsletter</hi> was able to change its
                        format: first from multilith to photo-offset, which allowed us to reproduce
                        pictures, and then from photo-offset in single columns to a double-column
                        format that allowed the pictures to be integrated more flexibly with the
                        text. We published our first color illustration in 1974-75, and another last
                        year. Bibliographical work gradually became a sort of sub-specialty,
                        beginning with the supplement to the Bentley-Nurmi <hi rend="i">Blake
                            Bibliography</hi> that appeared in one of the very early issues, which
                        was followed by Robert Essick’s handlist of reproductions,
                        Bentley’s checklist of the Blake <figure/> collection at the
                        British Museum, Ruth Lehrer’s checklist of the Rosenwald
                        collections, Everett Frost’s checklist of Blake slides, and a
                        host of others. Finally, in 1976 Thomas Minnick was added to the editorial
                        staff as Bibliographer, to handle all our bibliographical projects,
                        including the annual checklist of Blake scholarship, which was joined a
                        couple of years ago by Robert Essick’s annual checklist of sales,
                        "Blake in the Market-place." We published our first
                        special thematic issue, on Blake among Victorians, in 1974, and another, on
                        The Textbook Blake, with a long bibliographical essay with checklist by Mary
                        Lynn Johnson, in 1976. We contributed resources for discussion to the annual
                        MLA Blake seminar for the first time in 1975, with a supplemental booklet by
                        W. J. T. Mitchell on Blake’s pictures of the Last Judgment, and
                        again in 1976, with an essay by Irene Tayler on Blake’s
                        Laocoön. In 1975 we went outside the confines of the journal
                        itself to publish an inexpensive classroom facsimile of <hi rend="i">America</hi>, a feat we hope to duplicate with other works in
                        illuminated printing before too long.</p>
                    <p>Now, in 1977, with issue number 41, the first in our eleventh volume, we are
                        changing our name to bring it in line with what we think is the
                        truth—dropping "Newsletter" from the title to
                        become simply <hi rend="i">Blake An Illustrated Quarterly</hi>, and
                        reminding ourselves of our origins by making our "News"
                        section the "Newsletter." We have already grown, we
                        believe, to be the quarterly that our new name asserts we are, and therefore
                        we plan no special changes in format or extent, except that we shall now
                        welcome from contributors some of the longer and more
                        "interpretive" articles that we have never solicited in
                        the past.</p>
                    <p>The change in the price of a subscription that also goes into effect with
                        this volume is an anniversary present that we did not want to give to our
                        subscribers. We want to assure you that the raise in price has nothing to do
                        with the change in our name—only with the steady change in the
                        costs of goods and services. If history consoles, a subscription in 1967
                        cost $2; in 1970, $3 and $4; in 1971, $3 and $5; and by early 1972, $4 and
                        $5—the present rate, which has held steady for more than half a
                        decade (to put it as strongly as possible). The new rate is $6 for
                        individuals, $7 for institutions. MORRIS EAVES AND MORTON D. PALEY,

                        to light and were auctioned in London on 5 April 1977 by
                        Sotheby’s Belgravia. Two of the Songs have particular interest by
                        virtue of being the only known instances of Blake’s application
                        of his color-printing technique to the <hi rend="i">Songs of</hi>
                        <pb id="p11-61" n="61"/>
                        <hi rend="i">Innocence.</hi> These fragments, the illustration to
                        "The Shepherd" and the headpiece to
                        "Spring," are rather crudely printed in murky colors; the
                        lack of assurance evinced by this handling of the technique allies them
                        closely with Blake’s other experiments with color-printing
                        between 1794 and 1796; the <hi rend="i">Small Book of Designs</hi> (British
                        Museum, copy A) and, above all, the color-printed pages of the variegated
                            <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> in the British Museum (copy T),
                        bear the same characteristics. The remaining fragments, the tailpieces to
                        "Night" and "Spring" respectively, are
                        hand-colored; the delicate washes of the former are associated with early
                        copies of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>, but the condition of the
                        latter renders its dating uncertain. FRANCES CAREY, DEPARTMENT OF PRINTS

                        prints, together with some of the original blocks, executed by W. Graham
                        Robertson, in imitation of Blake’s monotype technique. Robert
                        Essick has already drawn attention to their existence in his last review of
                        the London sales (<hi rend="i">Newsletter 38</hi>). In addition to the
                        information he provides, it should be noted that Graham Robertson, like
                        Blake, appears to have taken three impressions from each block, the
                        experiment having been occasioned by the exhibition of his work, held at the
                        Carfax Gallery in 1906. The Tate Gallery has acquired one of the prints, <hi rend="i">Paolo and Francesca</hi>, and the British Museum now owns two

                    <p>"Eight years ago a girl of 20 [Margaret Trudeau] met a prime
                        minister of 49 [Pierre Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada] on the island of
                        Tahiti. They shared a passion for William Blake, the poet who once wrote,
                        ‘Love to faults is always blind / Always is to joy
                        inclin’d.’" Quoted from Ellen Goodman in her
                        syndicated newspaper column <hi rend="i">At Large</hi>, for Thursday, 31
                        March 1977.</p>
                    <p>On 28 April CBS-TV aired "Tiger, Tiger," a documentary on

                    </head>
                    <p>I am very grateful for Martin Nurmi’s appreciative remarks (<hi rend="i">Newsletter 40</hi>) about our audio-tape production of
                        Blake’s <hi rend="i">Island in the Moon.</hi> I’m
                        sorry to have to inform readers, however, that the assertion in the review
                        that the tape is now available for sale is incorrect (and I hasten to add
                        that the responsibility for this misinformation may well not lie with the
                        reviewer). Alas, as with many worthy things done with too little money, the
                        tape is frozen into a complicated limbo of rights, residuals, union
                        stipulations, and the like. Mr. Cansino and I labor towards that happy day
                        when all can have an <hi rend="i">Island</hi> that everyone will joy to
                        hear, but we cannot now foresee it.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime the tape is authorized only for rental to noncommercial radio
                        stations for broadcast purposes (the rates varying according to the size,
                        character, and relationship to Pacifica of the local station). Readers with
                        a cooperative college or community radio station at hand can have the
                        station arrange a broadcast through Pacifica Program Services, 5316 Venice
                        Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90027.</p>
                    <p>My personal copy of the tape can also be sometimes loaned to substantial
                        Blake gatherings; but it is beyond both my capacity and my contractual
                        restrictions to satisfy personal, scholarly, or classroom needs. Again,
                        alas.</p>
                    <p>Finally, it ought to be noted that we have come <hi rend="i">this</hi> far at
                        least with partial financial assistance from the National Endowment for the
                        Arts (on the genial principle that when empire puts money into art, such
                        recognition encourages them to keep doing it). EVERETT FROST, CALIFORNIA

                    <p>The <hi rend="i">Times Literary Supplement</hi> recently printed an article
                        by Charles Ryskamp, Director of the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York,
                        describing a new purchase from "a Continental library" of
                        a "specially bound life of Blake from the 1830 edition of <hi rend="i">Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters</hi> by Allan
                        Cunningham," and perhaps copied by Cunningham. The volume was
                        extra-illustrated with a number of impressions of Blake’s
                        engravings and etchings and two letters, one by John Varley to Cunningham,
                        the other from Bernard Barton, the Quaker poet, to Cunningham. Heretofore
                        unrecorded impressions from the illuminated books include <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 2, 41, 59 and <hi rend="i">America</hi> 12, 13, 14, all
                        posthumous impressions pulled by Tatham; contemporary impressions include
                            <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> ii, 3, 4, <hi rend="i">Book of Los</hi> 5, and
                            <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 28, 70, 75, some with differences from the
                        "published" states, some with changes apparently by Blake.
                        There are a number of Blake’s book illustrations, an
                        "unexplained variant" of Blake’s illustration
                        for the article on gem engraving for Rees’ <hi rend="i">Cyclopedia</hi>, and impressions of <figure/>
                        <pb id="p11-64" n="64"/> five of the "separate plates"
                        listed by Keynes: the portraits of Wilson Lowry and Lavater, <hi rend="i">Morning Amusement</hi> and <hi rend="i">Evening Amusement</hi> (both in

                        himself as poet, painter, illustrator, and print-maker; his conceptions of
                        the creative process, the self, masculinity (as opposed to femininity); his
