                <p>Although William Michael Rossetti has been given his due as a major contributor
                    to Victorian writings on Blake, a number of unpublished or unremarked details
                    relating to the preparation, publication and reception of his edition of the <hi rend="i">Poetical Works of William Blake</hi> (1874) make his concern with
                    Blake’s reputation worth returning to.<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> As early as 1864, in a letter to Horace Scudder, Rossetti lamented
                    the public response to Gilchrist in a way which suggests how much more he
                    considered needed to be done to secure Blake’s fame. Scudder had recently
                    reviewed Gilchrist in the <hi rend="i">North American Review</hi>, and Rossetti
                    was acknowledging a copy of the review. <note id="n1">
                        <hi rend="s">1</hi>
                        Rossetti’s part in the 1863 and 1880 editions of Gilchrist, his
                        Aldine edition, and his miscellaneous writings on Blake are discussed in the
                        bibliographies by Keynes, and Bentley and Nurmi, and in Deborah Dorfman, <hi rend="i">Blake in the Nineteenth Century</hi> (New Haven, 1969).
                        Dorfman’s account of the Aldine edition is the fullest (pp. 112-14,
                        165-67), but it needs supplementing as provided here. Our knowledge of the
                        preparation of Rossetti’s <hi rend="i">catalogue raisonné</hi>
                        for Gilchrist is sketchy, but it should be possible to fill in the details
                        as more of Rossetti’s correspondence becomes available. Of
                        Rossetti’s miscellaneous writings on Blake, the following do not
                        appear in the standard lists: (1) "Gilchrist’s Life of
                        Blake," <hi rend="i">Reader</hi>, 2 (November 1863), 544. (Corrects a

                <q> 27 November 1864<lb/> My dear Sir,<lb/> I have to thank you very sincerely for
                    your note, &amp; the accompanying review of Blake from the North American
                    Review. However I had already read the article; having seen it advertized &amp;
                    strongly suspecting—from my knowledge of what has taken place on former
                    occasions where a little openness to new impressions was needed, &amp; a little
                    boldness of opinion—that the book would be better estimated in America
                    than in England. I found my anticipation more than confirmed, &amp; derived
                    much pleasure from a perusal of the article. It is (if I may say so to you
                    without impertinence) far the best I have seen; &amp; I am sorry to say that it
                    is not necessarily so much a compliment as I mean it to be, for the English
                    notices, with one or two exceptions amounting to tolerable, have been silly,
                    poor stuff which an Englishman winces &amp; blushes at—or ought to do
                    so, at least.<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> My brother, who saw your
                    article here yesterday, joins me in rating that very differently—as being
                    positively not less than comparatively a worthy tribute to that very wonderful
                    genius, the "mad-man" of his discerning countrymen, Blake.<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref>

                <p>It was almost another decade, however, before Rossetti was offered the chance to
                    write comprehensively on Blake. Two entries in his Diary, the first for 8 May
                    1872 and the second for 6 August 1873, give a reasonably full account of the
                    origin of his edition: <q> Daldy the Publisher called on me, thinking of
                        including Blake in his Aldine series of Poets;<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> &amp; he asked me whether I wd. undertake the
                        editing—including a Memoir of some 30 to 100 pages. He does not wish
                        to insert the Prophetic Books, but only a complete set of the poems of an
                        ordinary cast. I replied that I wd. undertake the work for £50, on the
                        understanding <pb id="p12-5" n="5"/>
                        <figure/> that I am not to be controlled in anything I may see fit to say;
                        also that I might not find it convenient to commence the work for some 6
                        mos. or so to come. Daldy took leave, saying he wd. consult with his partner
                        Bell. He had in the first instance proposed for either Gabriel or me as
                        editor; but, as I told him, it is practically certain that G. wd.
                        decline.<lb/>

                        Aldine series. He wd. like the introductory notice to be only about 32 to 48

                    volume as thoroughly as we can document his earlier editions of Whitman and
                    Shelley, though a number of his letters to Swinburne and Mrs. Gilchrist offer
                    additional information. We can assume that he worked with his usual steadiness,
                    for on 4 March 1874 he informed Swinburne that "Yesterday I received the

                <p>In his correspondence with Mrs. Gilchrist and Swinburne between August 1873 and
                    March 1874, Rossetti discussed mainly copyright matters and the inclusion of
                    representative Prophetic Books. Initially he anticipated no difficulty over the
                    ten poems from the manuscript book later known as the Pickering MS., nine of
                    which D. G. Rossetti had printed in Volume II of Gilchrist. On 25 August 1873 he
                    wrote to Mrs. Gilchrist that "B[ell] wd. probably succeed in effecting some
                    arrangement with M[acmillan] &amp; P[ickering] enabling B. to reproduce the
                    poems," though four days later he admitted that "the matter appears to
                    be a little complicated."<ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref> By 27
                    February 1874 he had reason to complain to Swinburne about "a provoking
                    claim of copyright," and his fear that he might have to "miss
                    out" the poems, "thus spoiling the edition."<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> In another letter to Swinburne of 4 March 1874 he
                    reported as follows: <q> The copyright difficulty—of wh. I foresaw
                        something from the first—is this. You <pb id="p12-6" n="6"/>
                        <figure/> remember that certain poems by Blake were for the first time
                        published in Gilchrist’s book—viz.: those wh. came from the
                        manuscript belonging to Gabriel &amp; me, &amp; also certain others
                        (Auguries of Innocence, Mental Traveller, &amp;c) wh. came from a small MS.
                        then in the hands of Mrs. Gilchrist. The poems from this small MS. are <hi rend="i">someone’s</hi> copyright for 42 years from date of first
                        publication (1863), just as the poems from Gabriel’s &amp; my
                        manuscript are <hi rend="i">our</hi> copyright. It turns out that the small
                        book was claimed by and returned to Tatham, who sold it to Harvey
                        (bookseller), who sold it to Pickering;<ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref> &amp; the latter republished these poems in or about 1865,
                        along with the Innocence &amp; Experience. Thus Pickering is the present
                        owner of this copyright; &amp; he, not liking Bell, nor relishing a further
                        republication of the poems, declines to authorize reissue. This is very
                        annoying. Bell did tell me a fortnight or so ago that he understands Dr.
                        Wilkinson is in possession of a certain Blake MS. containing perhaps these

                    March 1874 that further probing by Bell had established an interpretation of the
                    ownership of copyright favorable to his edition: <q> Bell told me the other day
                        . . . that the only poem to wh. Pickering’s copyright really applies
                        is Long John Brown.<ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref> This is indeed a
                        great satisfaction: for whether L. J. B. is in or out matters hardly at all.
                        I don’t however understand <hi rend="i">why</hi> Pickering’s
                        copyright is limited to that particular poem. My view of the matter was
                        this: —copyright attached to that whole series of poems for 42 years
                        following date of first publication, 1863: Pickering, at a later date,
                        became the legal owner of the poems, and therefore of the unexpired residue
                        of their copyright. <hi rend="i">Macmillan</hi> . . . was never the owner of
                        the copyright. Mrs. Gilchrist was the owner, as regards the Life generally:
                        &amp; it seems each proprietor of <hi rend="i">poems previously
                            unpublished</hi> was owner of the copyright in those same poems. Hence
                        Tatham was in 1863 owner of the copyright in the Pickering poems. I am
                        surprised to learn that he is still the owner; but Bell’s letter
                        seems to imply as much. Tatham gave me carte blanche some while ago, in case
                        he had any rights in the matter.<ref target="n17" type="note">17</ref>

                <p>Although Rossetti obviously had doubts about Bell’s understanding of the
                    matter, he finally added the Pickering poems to his edition, excluding
                    "Long John Brown" as D. G. Rossetti had done in 1863. In the
                    circumstances one would expect him to have reproduced his brother’s
                        versions,<ref target="n18" type="note">18</ref> but his practice was
                    sometimes to follow the edition prepared for Pickering by R. H. Shepherd in 1866
                    and reissued in 1874, at other times to follow his brother, while at the same
                    time introducing emendations of his own.<ref target="n19" type="note">19</ref>
                    For example, as Sampson pointed out in 1905, Rossetti’s text of "The
                    Grey Monk" adopts four of D. G. Rossetti’s emendations, but
                    "follows Shepherd <figure/>
                    <pb id="p12-7" n="7"/> in the number and arrangement of verses, and generally as
                    to text, adopting two out of the three important changes from the MS. Book
                        version."<ref target="n20" type="note">20</ref> On the other hand, in
                    "The Crystal Cabinet" he adopts freely from both Shepherd and D. G.
                    Rossetti, and introduces substantial punctuation of his own devising. But on the
                    whole he was cautious about offering new readings. Fresh from his editing of
                    Shelley, he had no wish to encounter again the many reviewers who had taken
                    exception to his numerous conjectural emendations of Shelley’s poems.<ref target="n21" type="note">21</ref>

                        <hi rend="s">22</hi> During the 1860’s Rossetti’s
                        attitude towards the Prophetic Books, if not overly sympathetic, was at
                        least open. On 22 May 1862 Mrs. Gilchrist requested from him "brief

                        Misc. d. 332, fol. 213) where he records that remarks by him of a critical

                        Mrs. Gilchrist’s list was extended is suggested by a surviving note
                        on <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>, which Mrs.
                        Gilchrist "reduced," certain that Macmillan would reject it,

                        it, replacing Rossetti’s direct exposition with the statement that
                        "Formidable moral questions are opened up through the medium of this
                        allegory. . . . But we will not enter on them here." (<hi rend="i">Life

                        from the second edition of 1880.) It is worth mentioning as well
                        Rossetti’s lengthy exposition of "The Mental Traveller,"
                        printed in Gilchrist, as evidence of his willingness to tackle a difficult
                        text; and his constant support for Swinburne’s <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, of which he wrote to the poet on 2 January [1866] after
                        reading the manuscript: "I should consider its publication the greatest

                <p>At the same time, it should be noted that however ambivalent Rossetti’s
                    attitude towards the Prophetic Books was, he favored publication of a
                    letterpress edition. Their exclusion from the Aldine edition, he insisted to
                    Swinburne, "wd. not have been my voluntary choice," and he again
                    excused that "it was obviously the only course likely to be adopted by a

                    prefixed to the edition he explicitly called for publication, arguing that

                        done."<ref target="n28" type="note">28</ref> Four years later, in a

                        cannot omit the present opportunity of saying that the publication in
                        ordinary book-form, without designs, and without any attempt at facsimile of
                        text, of the <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and other Prophetic Books, is
                        highly to be desired. Difficult under any circumstances, it would be a good
                        deal <hi rend="i">less</hi> difficult to read these works in an edition of
                        that kind, with clear print, <figure/> reasonable division of lines, and the
                        like aids to business-like perusal. An index of the mythologic personages of
                        Blake’s strangely-named pantheon or pandemonium, with an account of
                        their various and semi-intelligible performances throughout the successive
                        Prophetic Books, would also be a powerful aid to such understanding of the
                        subject as is, in the nature of things, possible. No doubt the compilation
                        of such an index would be rather like attempting to draw a nightmare to
                        scale: but something or other in that direction could undoubtedly be

                    and 1903, he observed: <q> I know most of what has been written about Blake, but
                        have not investigated the elaborate study of his works by Messrs. Ellis
                        &amp; Yeats in their edition of a few years ago. I had a little speech with
                        them on this subject, &amp; learned that they regarded Blake’s
                        religious or quasi-religious utterances, usually counted to be chaotic, as
                        cosmical in essence, &amp; in detail interpretable. I presume that this
                        view is to some valid extent justified by their commentary; yet cannot bring
                        myself to think that Blake was in these matters a constructive thinker or an
                        orderly expositor. My impression continues as heretofore—that, while
                        he was a great genius in two arts, there was also a maniacal side to his
                        intellect. Needless to <pb id="p12-8" n="8"/>
                        <figure/> say that he was not a madman pure &amp; simple: but he was a
                        creative inventor whose ideas &amp; utterances struggled beyond the limits
                        of sanity. This view may be erroneous: it is the one to which my studies of
                        Blake’s works have led me.<ref target="n30" type="note">30</ref>

                                September 1890, "Yeats the young Irish Poet (to whom I was
                                introduced some while ago at a Shelley meeting) left a card the
                                other day noting that he wd. like to speak to me on some Blake
                                matters, as he is now writing on that subject. I explained that we
                                are in the confusion of moving, &amp; suggested that he might
                                perhaps as well call at Somer. Ho. He did so today, &amp; we had a
                                longish talk. He is certainly a very acute &amp; bright-minded
                                young man. He &amp; one of the Ellis (Philological) family are
                                engaged in producing a complete edition of B’s Prophetical
                                Books &amp;c., with comment expounding his philosophical or
                                speculative system—wh. Y. regards as being founded very
                                mainly on Boehme. This matter was glanced at in an article by York
                                Powell (I was reading it the other evg.), introductory to the
                                "Book of Los" lately discovered. Tho’ I have not as
                                yet been disposed to regard B’s Jerusalem &amp;c. as capable
                                of more than a moderate amount of reasoned explanation, I see, from
                                what Y. says, that there is a good deal to be adduced &amp;
                                expounded from his point of view. What he more particuly. wanted
                                from me was to trace out the Book of Ahania, &amp; The French
                                Revolution. He says they are not in the British Museum. My
                                impression is that that is where I read them (in 1862): I shall
                                probably, as I look into the matter, be able to give Y. some little
                                further informn. as to details. I referred Y. to that passage in my
                                Memoir of B. in wh. I indicate the affiliation of his theology to
                                that of Marcion: Y. seems as yet not to have fixed his attention on
                                this passage, but he will now give some practical study to the
                                question."</p>
                            <p>13 April 1891, "Yeats, &amp; his colleague in the project of
                                reediting Blake . . . called on me at Somers. Ho. Their undertaking
                                has now reached an advanced stage. They showed me one of the
                                Prophetic Books reprinted in a quasi-facsimile. I
                                think—&amp; told them so—that I regard this as a
                                decided mistake. One cannot read with any comfort a book in any such
                                sort of fancy-type: besides the cost of the edition, both to
                                projectors and to purchasers must thus become beyond all bounds of
                                reason."</p>
                            <p>Yeats later wrote of Rossetti, <hi rend="i">apropos</hi> of his
                                opinion of the Prophetic Books, that he was "a man of
                                exceptional ability and high literary standing, who happens not to
                                be in sympathy with Blake’s method of writing." <hi rend="i">The Works of William Blake</hi>, ed. E. J. Ellis and W.

                    </q> That Rossetti deleted this passage when he prepared his autobiography for
                    publication in 1906 could, of course, be interpreted as suggesting a waning of
                    confidence in his judgment. <note id="n27">

                <p>To the reviewers of the Aldine edition in 1874-1875, Rossetti’s kind of
                    cautious assessment was (in a word applied to the Memoir by most of them)
                    "sound." Edmund Gosse’s two-part review in the <hi rend="i">Examiner</hi>
                    <ref target="n31" type="note">31</ref> offers the most
                    pronounced indication of critical opinion of Blake in the 1870s. Gosse, a friend
                    both of the Rossettis and of Swinburne, declared that there was a danger
                    "that, after so long a time of disgrace and oblivion, the reaction may be
                    too violent, and the enthusiasm over the newfound wonder be blind and altogether
                    excessive." He confessed that "some such fear as this was in our mind
                    when we began Mr. Rossetti’s long, learned, and most interesting memoir;
                    and, though we are of the opinion that in one or two cases his admiration for
                    his subject has led him beyond what the canons of pure criticism permit, we are
                    bound in justice to say that, as a whole, his memoir is as remarkable for clear
                    judgment and good sense as it is for enthusiasm." At the same time Gosse
                    was sharply critical of Rossetti’s urging of the publication of the
                    Prophetic Books: "He seems to us to propose one of the most hopeless and
                    ill-advised experiments that the publishing world has ever seen." A similar
                    criticism came from John Dennis in the <hi rend="i">Spectator.</hi>
                    <ref target="n32" type="note">32</ref> Dennis expressed surprise that,
                    considering Rossetti’s opinion that the Prophetic Books "are neither
                    readable nor even entirely sane" (Dennis’ words), he should consider
                    it desirable that they be published: "We disagree with him altogether.
                    Blake wrote a great deal of what, had it been the work of a smaller man, would
                    be accounted trash, and the sooner it is forgotten the better for his fame. We
                    venture indeed to think that Mr. Rossetti would have done wisely to omit a good
                    deal contained in this small volume, since there are passages here as free
                    almost from mind and meaning as any combination of words could well be."
                    Only George Saintsbury in the <hi rend="i">Academy</hi>
                    <ref target="n33" type="note">33</ref> supported publication: "The sooner it is done the
                    better." Yet even Saintsbury was of the opinion that on Blake’s
                    madness Rossetti’s "conclusions might have been safely stated with
                    much less qualification, that Blake was most undoubtedly mad, unless the meaning
                    of words is to be strangely perverted." Much the same point was made, less
                    sympathetically, by Coventry Patmore in the <hi rend="i">St. James’s
                        Gazette</hi>: "Mr. W. Rossetti . . . goes a great way further in his
                    admiration of Blake than reason can be shown for."<ref target="n34" type="note">34</ref> What these reviews amply demonstrate (and other reviews
                    in such papers as the <hi rend="i">Daily News</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Sunday
                        Times</hi> closely echo them)<ref target="n35" type="note">35</ref> is that
                    the publishers were clearly right in thinking that the Prophetic Books did not
                    yet have a place in a "popular" edition of Blake’s poems, and
                    just as clearly, that Rossetti’s qualified assessment of Blake’s
                    genius, however tame and wrong-headed it would in time appear, was in 1874
                    somewhat in advance of the times. The real value of Rossetti’s edition,
                    as Saintsbury remarked, consisted in the "increased facilities" it
                    offered for studying a significant portion of Blake’s poetry, and of
                    assessing its "certain excellences." This value it retained until its
                    place was taken by the Yeats-Ellis edition of 1893, and, more effectively, by
                    Sampson’s one-volume edition of 1905.<ref target="n36" type="note">36</ref>

                <p>The attribution of the unsigned plates in the English translation of C. G.
                    Salzmann’s <hi rend="i">Elements of Morality</hi>
                    <ref target="n37" type="note">1</ref> has had a checkered career. In the first edition of his
                        <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi>, Alexander Gilchrist wrote that
                    Blake "illustrated" Salzmann’s "pinafore precepts,"
                    leaving it unclear as to whether Blake simply engraved the plates, designed
                    them, or both.<ref target="n38" type="note">2</ref> The ambiguity was corrected
                    for the second edition (1880, I, 91), where the German artist Daniel Nicolaus
                    Chodowiecki (1726-1801) was named as the designer and Blake as the engraver. The
                    change may have been prompted by a brief note by Frederick Locker on "The
                    Illustrations in Mrs. Godwin’s ‘Elements of
                        Morality,’"<ref target="n39" type="note">3</ref> which points
                    out that the plates were designed by Chodowiecki with the exception of those
                    numbered 27 and 28. These two plates were exhibited at the Grolier Club in 1905
                    and described in the catalogue as being of Blake’s "own
                        designing."<ref target="n40" type="note">4</ref> This attribution of
                    pl. 27, at least to Blake as the engraver, can be rejected with a fair degree of
                    confidence because, like the frontispiece to vol. I and pls. 1, 7, 10 (signed
                        <hi rend="i">W. P: C fect 1790</hi>), and 11, it was clearly executed by
                    someone other than the engraver of the remaining forty-five plates and looks not
                    in the least like Blake’s hand. In his catalogue of 1912, A. G. B.
                    Russell, exercising his usual skepticism about Gilchrist’s casual
                    attributions, lists only fourteen plates as Blake’s copy work, including
                    eight "possibly, but not certainly, by Blake."<ref target="n41" type="note">5</ref> In his great <hi rend="i">Bibliography of William
                        Blake</hi> of 1921, Geoffrey Keynes ascribes sixteen plates to Blake,<ref target="n42" type="note">6</ref> only ten of which are the same as those
                    listed by Russell. Keynes takes note of the Grolier catalogue attribution of
                    pls. 27 and 28 and comments that "the treatment of the trees and vines in
                    the second of these (pl. 28) certainly suggests Blake’s work," but
                    then rejects this idea because both "plates were obviously not engraved by
                    him." Bentley and Nurmi are a bit more generous, crediting Blake with
                    seventeen plates but expressing judicious uneasiness over the whole business of
                    attribution on stylistic grounds.<ref target="n43" type="note">7</ref> Bentley

                    possibly pl. 48, are by the same engraver, or at least by a group following a
                    "house style" as in the <hi rend="i">Novelist’s Magazine.</hi>
                    A comparison of the English plates illustrating Salzmann with their German
                    prototypes provides new evidence for Blake’s involvement. More
                    surprisingly, it suggests that the Grolier catalogue may be right about pl. 28.

                    English engraver(s). These changes are listed below, along with speculations on

                    "grand house" (I, 16 in the 1791 edition). I have not been able to
                    find out if English drawing rooms were more frequently carpeted than the
                    Continental variety.</p>

                    been eliminated in the English, and two children added on the left. The first
                    change follows the text, for the scene takes place "after the cloth was
                    taken away" (II, 48). The text does not specifically place the children in
                    the scene, but they are mentioned (II, 49) in the conversation between the
                    husband and wife pictured in both plates.</p>

                    appropriate for the breakfast room setting.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="i">Pl. 38</hi> (illus. 2). The German squared floor has been replaced
                    by rough boards and a carpet in the English copy. At least the boards seem more
                    appropriate than the squared floor, for this is the room of a poor and
                    desperately sick family. The wicker basket on the left does not appear in the
                    German plate. It is probably the cradle of the infant at his mother’s
                    breast and is reminiscent of the basket-cradles in Blake’s "A Cradle
                    Song" (second plate) and "Infant Sorrow."</p>

                    cart, and the second sleigh on the far right replaced by a horse and rider. Both
                    changes follow the English text, for the family is specifically placed in a
                    "cart" three times (III, 116, 117, 123) and there is no reference to a
                    second cart or sleigh. "The boy who rode on the first horse" (III,
                    123) probably refers to a servant riding on the lead horse hitched to the cart,
                    but may have prompted the addition far right.</p>

                <p>The alterations in pls. 20, 38, 44, and 47 show a careful responsiveness to the
                    text which is most unusual for simple copy engravings in a children’s
                    book. This fact alone suggests the habits of mind of the engraver of the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> and <hi rend="i">Job</hi> illustrations, but it
                    is a seemingly insignificant addition to the English plates that points more
                    directly to Blake.</p>
                <p>The carpets added to pls. 3, 34, 38, 41, 45, and 46 bear the same bold swirls,
                    arabesques, and vegetative motifs (see illus. 1, 2). On pls. 26, 29, and 43, the
                    engraver has modified Chodowiecki’s original carpets to picture this
                    pattern. The same sort of carpet appears in three plates unquestionably by
                    Blake. In 1788 Blake etched and engraved his fine plate of Hogarth’s
                    "Beggar’s Opera." The carpet (illus. 3) beneath
                    Macheath’s left foot is a larger version of those in the Salzmann
                    illustrations. Except for the swirls in the lower left corner, the pattern is
                    only vaguely suggested in Hogarth’s oil painting (Mellon collection). Its
                    specific deliniation in the print is as much the engraver’s as the
                    designer’s. That this particular carpet became part of Blake’s
                    decorative repertoire is confirmed by its reappearance in two later original
                    graphics: the "Moore and Co’s Advertisement" of c. 1797 (illus.

                        apparently had no other names in earlier years.</note>
                </p>
                <p>The appearance of the carpet pattern—as it were, a Blakean
                    signature—in some of the Salzmann plates lends new credence to the
                    contention that Blake was their engraver. And if we attribute the carpet plates
                    to him, I find it impossible to go through the other forty-five candidates and
                    weed out definite non-Blakes, with the possible exception of pl. 48. There is of
                    course a natural resistance to attributing to Blake’s hand all this
                    undistinguished hack-work. That, however, should not stand in our way. By 1790
                    Blake was a very skilled etcher-engraver (witness the Hogarth plate), but he
                    inevitably modified his style according to the genre in which he was
                    working—and no doubt according to <pb id="p12-13" n="13"/> the fee as
                    well. For example, in 1784 Blake engraved two sophisticated "fancy"
                    stipple prints after Stothard, "Zephyrus and Flora" and
                    "Calisto," and in the same year produced six crude plates for <hi rend="i">The Wit’s Magazine.</hi> In each case, the style is
                    appropriate for the subject, and the latter group perfectly suited to the rough
                    humor of their literary context.<ref target="n48" type="note">12</ref> This
                    Blakean version of eighteenth-century rules of decorum is a persistent feature
                    of Blake’s entire career as a graphic artist. For a children’s
                    book like the <hi rend="i">Elements of Morality</hi>, the simple mixed-method
                    plates are appropriate for the simple moralistic tales they accompany. The same
                    may be said for Blake’s relief etchings in <hi rend="i">Little Tom the
                        Sailor</hi>, for which the artist himself pointed out the principle of
                    decorum: "they are rough like rough sailors."<ref target="n49" type="note">13</ref> When compared with other prints of the period intended
                    for a youthful audience, such as the Carver &amp; Bowles "catchpenny
                    prints" or those in Banbury chap books,<ref target="n50" type="note">14</ref> the Salzmann plates seem almost elegant. That they are less
                    accomplished than the Wollstonecraft illustrations, begun in the same year as
                    the last of those for Salzmann, can be attributed at least in part to the fact
                    that in one case Blake was executing signed plates after his own designs, and in
                    the other rapidly producing a good many unsigned copy prints. <note id="n48">

                <p>Plate 28 (illus. 5) offers the greatest challenge to the chalcographer. At first
                    glance it would seem to be one of the prints executed by the "other
                    hand." But this is only because the smallness of the figure relative to the
                    size of the whole design is similar to the frontispiece to vol. I and pl. 27; in
                    graphic style pl. 28 is strikingly different. Most of the prints throughout <hi rend="i">Elements of Morality</hi> suffer from the <hi rend="i">horror
                        vacui</hi> endemic among eighteenth-century engravers, although those plates
                    most frequently attributed to Blake in the past are less cluttered than the
                    others. Plate 28 is the most open of them all, with the worm lines so much a
                    part of Blake’s early style but remarkably little crosshatching. Blake
                    used a similarly open, etched style, deriving from Salvator Rosa, in two plates
                    after Fuseli, "Timon and Alcibiades" and "Falsa ad Coelum"
                    of 1790, and attempted to combine it with more conventional patterns in the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> engravings (1796-97) and the illustrations,
                    also after Fuseli, for Charles Allen’s <hi rend="i">New and Improved
                        History of England</hi> and <hi rend="i">New and Improved Roman
                    History</hi>, both of 1798. Almost every motif in pl. 28 also has its parallel
                    in Blake’s work. The slender tree with arching branches recalls those in
                    "The Lamb," "Night" (first plate), "The Little Girl
                    Lost" (first plate), the title-page of <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi>,
                    and <hi rend="i">America</hi> pl. 7. A much stronger parallel is between the
                    vine on the right margin of pl. 28 and that on the right in the frontispiece to
                    Wollstonecraft’s <hi rend="i">Original Stories</hi> (illus. 6), also
                    climbing up a wall next to a portal. The delineation of the leaves is almost
                    identical. The general subject—a child or children before a large
                    doorway—can also be compared to the Wollstonecraft frontispiece,
                    "Nurse’s Song" in <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi>, and
                        <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> pl. 26. This last example also contains
                    a heavy wooden door as in the Salzmann plate, but the closest parallel for the
                    setting is the water color illustration to Young’s <hi rend="i">Night
                        Thoughts</hi>, Night II, p. 7, where Blake also pictures a gigantic door in
                    a curiously free-standing wall. Salzmann’s text indicates that William,
                    pictured in pl. 28, is locked <figure>

                    <hi rend="i">inside</hi> a garden, but it seems as though anyone not so caught
                    up by "impatience" could simply walk around the end of the wall, just
                    as in the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> design. William’s clothes are
                    generally like those of other children in the Salzmann plates, including the
                    unattributed pl. 27, but are more closely fitting and with less distinction
                    between breeches and blouse than the other outfits, and without the usual
                    jacket. In these respects William’s clothing is similar to that worn by
                    the boys in <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, particularly
                    one in "Nurse’s Song" in <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>, and by
                    the shepherd in the <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> frontispiece. Lastly,
                    William’s arm and hand gesture is very close to the young woman’s
                    in the illustration to Thomas Commins’ <hi rend="i">Elegy Set to
                        Music</hi>, designed and engraved by Blake in 1786. Each of these parallels
                    is in itself inconclusive, but taken together they form a remarkably consistent
                    pattern of Blakean styles and motifs. Perhaps Johnson allowed each of his two
                    engravers to contribute one new design to the book, and thus pl. 27 is the other
                    copyist’s effort. My tentative attribution of pl. 28 to Blake as both
                    designer and engraver is certainly open to question, but the evidence suggests
                    that, even when hired as a journeyman copyist, Blake found an opportunity to
                    create one small work of original graphic art.</p>

                <p>The attribution of engravings is often a very difficult matter in the absence of
                    definitive biographical evidence. It is especially difficult in an area such as
                    that represented by Blake’s commercial engravings, in which the engraver
                    is often following another man’s designs, and in which a personal style
                    tends to be submerged in conventions that are not particular to any one
                    individual. An experienced eye and mind may be able to look at a print and
                    arrive at a correct attribution, but such an intuitive solution may be difficult
                    to support in debate without the evidence of some identifiable minute
                    particulars. This brief essay is an attempt to provide a few such particulars in
                    support of a conclusion arrived at, it would seem, by an intuitive process honed
                    by long and committed experience.</p>
                <p>Some years ago the six plates signed "Blake" in the three volumes of
                        <hi rend="i">The Seaman’s Recorder</hi> were claimed for William
                    Blake in an article written by G. E. Bentley, Jr., though with an
                    acknowledgement that they were "the merest journeyman work."<ref target="n51" type="note">1</ref> This drew a reply from Geoffrey Keynes, who
                    argued that the "plain incompetence" of the etchings made it
                    impossible to attribute them to William Blake, the signatures
                        notwithstanding.<ref target="n52" type="note">2</ref> Bentley, in his recent
                        <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, still regards the plates as William
                    Blake’s, but adds the comment that Keynes’s case "will be
                    stronger when there is clear evidence that another engraver named Blake was
                    signing plates in the 1820s."<ref target="n53" type="note">3</ref>

                <p>Such evidence exists, and not too surprisingly is to be found in the Print Room
                    of the British Museum. There, the only item in a folder marked, and catalogued,
                    "E. Blake?" is a proof (<hi rend="i">BM</hi> 1920-9-30-1) of the plate
                    "Lord Byron in a Storm" from <hi rend="i">The Seaman’s
                        Recorder.</hi> The cataloguer has obviously not identified the print as
                    deriving from this work, but has added a note (referring to A. G. B.
                    Russell’s <hi rend="i">The Engravings of William Blake</hi>) which
                    associates the print, quite correctly in my view, with the E. Blake who etched
                    some of the plates for W. West’s Theatrical Characters, of which the
                    British Museum Print Room has a large collection.</p>
                <p>A comparison of the signature of the Lord Byron plate (illus. 1) with the
                    signature of the E. Blake who etched some of the Theatrical Characters plates
                    shows a close resemblance in style and form. Two of these signatures are
                    reproduced here, one reading "Blake fect" (illus. 2)<ref target="n54" type="note">4</ref> and the other "E. Blake fc [Sc?]" (illus.
                        3);<ref target="n55" type="note">5</ref> the signatures resemble each other
                    quite closely, and there is another plate signed "E. Blake fect" to
                    act as a mediator between the two forms illustrated.<ref target="n56" type="note">6</ref> It is apparent that these two signatures are very close
                    indeed to the signature on the Lord Byron plate. The dates are also entirely
                    compatible; the <hi rend="i">Seaman’s Recorder</hi> volumes are dated
                    1824-1825, while the Theatrical Characters plates from which illustrations 2 and

                    responsible for all of these plates. <note id="n54">

                    "Blake" from <hi rend="i">The Seaman’s Recorder</hi>, which all
                    follow the pattern of the signature (illus. 4) to the plate representing

                    Bentley’s Plate No. 2.</p>
                <p>These engraved signatures look rather like some of William Blake’s, but in
                    fact William Blake never closed the loop of a "k" in this period,
                    though he did do this sometimes in earlier signatures, as on the vignette on p.
                    21 of <hi rend="i">The Poetical Works of John Scott Esq.</hi> (1782), <hi rend="i">The Idle Laundress</hi> (1788), and Plate 21 for Vol. 3 of <hi rend="i">The Antiquities of Athens</hi> (1791), the last of which is
                    reproduced here (illus. 5). But apart from the plate for Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Life of George Romney</hi> (published 1809), on which I think that
                    the imprint and signature are most probably not actually cut by Blake
                        himself,<ref target="n60" type="note">10</ref> I have been unable to find
                    any engraved or etched signature known to be by William Blake and later than
                    1800 with a closed loop on the "k." <note id="n60">
                        <hi rend="s">10</hi> This is an opinion based partly on the style of the lettering
                        and partly on the long period of time between Blake’s work on the
                        plate (his letter of 11 December 1805 refers to it as very nearly finished)
                        and the actual date of publication; I would assume that the plate had long
                        been out of Blake’s hands when the publication date of 14 April 1809
                        was cut on all the plates in the volume, not only Blake’s. It is
                        worth remembering Bentley’s warning that inscriptions are not always
                        the work of the original engraver; see David V. Erdman, "Dating

                <p>Writers on Blake’s commercial engravings have usually been wary of using
                    stylistic evidence as the basis for making attributions, in the absence of
                    supporting forms of documentation. I think this caution is usually justified,
                    but on the other hand Blake scholars have grown accustomed to accepting the
                    evidence of changes in the formation of the serif at the top of a "g"
                    in determining the date of some of Blake’s works,<ref target="n61" type="note">11</ref> and even in the attribution of the map of Hafod in

                    etched signatures for this essay, I think that the evidence presented here is

                    In this instance, a technique—developed by Erdman with the assistance of
                    Bentley—of using the evidence provided by Blake’s script can be
                    used to confirm the intuition of Keynes. Here, at least, the letter and the
                    spirit are in concord. <note id="n61">

                <p>This "Masque for Dancing" had been invented by Dr. Geoffrey Keynes some
                    years previously. An ardent balletomane and a great authority on the work of
                    William Blake, he had felt that Blake’s <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the
                        Book of Job</hi>, first published as a series of twenty-one engravings in
                    1825, unconsciously provided settings which could easily be translated on the
                    stage, while there were "innumerable suggestions in his figures for
                    attitudes and groupings, which cried out for their conversion by a choreographer
                    into actuality and movement." He prepared a detailed scenario for a stage
                    production and persuaded his sister-in-law Gwendolen Raverat (<hi rend="i">née</hi> Darwin) to design backcloths based on Blake’s
                    drawings and to colour small cut-out figures to represent the leading characters
                    in the main scenes and groupings. These designs were prepared for a toy theatre,
                    and when the cardboard figures were assembled they illustrated very exactly the
                    main climaxes of the action as they were eventually to appear in the ballet. Dr.
                    Keynes had completed his scheme for the ballet by 1927 and had persuaded Ralph
                    Vaughan Williams (a cousin of the Darwins) to compose the music. He sent a

                    position to produce such a ballet, but the subject did not appeal to Diaghileff
                    and he rejected it as too English and too old-fashioned. Dr. Keynes can probably
                    take credit, however, for having sown a seed in the great man’s mind
                    which was later to bear fruit in the production of <hi rend="i">Le Fils

                <p>With the formation of the Camargo Society, Dr. Keynes saw another chance of
                    having <hi rend="i">Job</hi> produced, and he invited Lilian Baylis and Ninette
                    de Valois to come and see the models and the toy theatre. They were at once
                    interested and it was agreed that de Valois should undertake the production,
                    following the scenario of Dr. Keynes and using Mrs. Raverat’s designs.
                    Dr. Vaughan Williams had stipulated that there should be no <hi rend="i">pointe</hi> work (which he detested) and that <hi rend="i">Job</hi> should
                    not be described as a ballet, so the description "a Masque for
                    Dancing" was adopted. De Valois made a very careful study of the Blake
                    engravings and began to plan her production, while Mrs. Raverat set to work
                    painting scenery at the Old Vic. The production was to be presented by the
                    Camargo Society at its fourth programme and Geoffrey Keynes undertook to finance
                    it, being assisted by several friends, in particular by his brother Maynard and

                    <hi rend="i">Job</hi> won much esteem for both the Camargo Society and the
                    Vic-Wells Ballet. With <hi rend="i">Job</hi>, Edwin Evans used to say, Camargo
                    stepped on the map of Europe. Karsavina said, "The dignity of the greatest
                    tragedy of all ages is nowhere impaired by a mere dance for the dance’s
                    sake, and yet this production fully answers the qualification of ballet. The
                    quality of mime in <hi rend="i">Job</hi> is that of the flowing pattern of a
                    well-conceived dance." Perhaps Lydia Lopokova, at first not very
                    enthusiastic but greatly impressed after seeing it performed at Oxford during
                    the Ninth Annual Festival of the International Society for Contemporary Music,
                    put her finger on the most important achievement when she wrote to Geoffrey
                    Keynes: "My chief pleasure was that it differed from the Russian ballet
                    tradition, the most important merit of <hi rend="i">Job.</hi>" Ashley
                    Dukes, writing in the American <hi rend="i">Theatre Arts Monthly</hi> about the
                    English theatre in general, said <hi rend="i">Job</hi> was by far the most
                    satisfying achievement of the English theatre that season, representing
                    "the impressive silence in the midst of unimpressive talk."</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="i">Job</hi> owed no small part of its success to the performance of
                    Anton Dolin as Satan, Blakish and devilish, yet superbly arrogant and physically
                    magnificent in a way that none of his successors have been able to equal,
                    although all of them (and Robert Helpman in particular) have given striking and
                    valid interpretations. At the time of the first Vic-Wells performances Dolin was
                    still appearing in <hi rend="i">Stand Up and Sing</hi>, but Jack Buchanan (to
                    whom all honour) gave him permission to dance at the Vic, and his performance
                    was a major feature of the success of the ballet—although the timing was
                    so close that he had to take his last curtain half-dressed in evening clothes,
                    with a taxi waiting at the stage door to whisk him back to the Hippodrome.
                    Lilian Baylis wrote him her thanks: "Ellen Terry was one of the first great
                    players who gave such practical help to the Old Vic, and you are the first great
                    dancer, and I shall pray and remember you always with very great
                    affection." <note type="unreferenced" place="footer">Photo behind title:

                <p>The trends I outlined in my last survey of Blake sales (<hi rend="i">Blake
                        Newsletter</hi>, 10 [1976], 53-59) have continued. A new German interest in
                    Blake—note the purchase of the study of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl.
                    51 by the Hamburg Kunsthalle—and the improving British economy have added
                    new stimuli to an already active market. The book market, particularly for early
                    facsimiles and volumes with Blake’s engravings, remains on its steep
                    upward course. Two young dealers, Donald Heald of London and Edwin C. Epps, Jr.,
                    of Columbia, South Carolina, have begun businesses with a special emphasis on
                    Blake. Both bring considerable expertise to the field. Three of Blake’s
                    most important series of intaglio illustrations—<hi rend="i">Night
                        Thoughts, The Grave</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Job</hi>—have increased
                    considerably in price, although their continued availability has held off the
                    sharp rise that will undoubtedly occur as soon as these works become truly rare.
                    Once again, no complete illuminated book came on the market, but several
                    individual pages or fragments did appear. The best drawings and prints have
                    fared well, but the market continues shallow and weak for the less impressive
                    drawings. When none of the half-dozen major dealers or collectors compete for a
                    drawing, its sale price (or frequently buy-in by the seller) is about the same
                    as it would have been five years ago.</p>
                <p>The following lists have the same format as the 1974-75 survey, with only minor
                    modifications. All Sotheby, Sotheby Parke-Bernet, and Christie’s auction
                    catalogues have been surveyed, as have the catalogues of the major dealers who
                    regularly handle original Blake materials. I have made no attempt to search out
                    every sale of original works, and thus there are no doubt a good many sales of
                    the more common printed items not included here. A few late 1975 and early 1978
                    sales are also listed.</p>
                <p>I wish to thank Martin Butlin, Detlef W. Dörrbecker, Ruth Fine, and
                    Shaunagh FitzGerald of P. &amp; D. Colnaghi &amp; Co. for their assistance in
                    compiling this list.</p>

                                grey wash. Inscribed in pencil upper left, not in Blake’s
                                hand, "The Good Farmer giving his field[s?] / in Famine / both
                                sides." Essick Collection. This working sketch is the
                                transition between the earlier and later groups of the six known
                                versions of the composition. The first two pen drawings (British
                                Museum) have the central figure dressed as on the recto of this
                                drawing (Illus. 2). Like this verso sketch, the later pen and wash
                                drawings (Tate Gallery, University of Texas) show him with two
                                garments, a cloak over a gown, rather than the single gown of the
                                earlier versions. The change from the energetic pose of the central
                                figure and the swirling hem of his clothing to a more restrained and
                                rectilinear composition may have been motivated by the same
                                neoclassical norms also influencing Blake’s friends, Stothard
                                and Flaxman, in the early 1780s.</figDesc>

                                Grave" on the verso, not in Blake’s hand. For some years
                                on deposit at the Fitzwilliam Museum by a South African collector
                                under the title "An Allegory of Human Life," now destined
                                for the Yale Center of British Art. This is apparently the
                                illustration to Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>, never
                                published, described by Flaxman in his letter to Hayley of 18 Oct.
                                1805 as "The Gambols of Ghosts according with their affections
                                previous to the final Judgment." Also described by Rossetti in
                                Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Life of Blake</hi> (1863), II, 242, no. 21.
                                On p. 2 of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> (1808 ed.), Blair writes of
                                "light-heel’d ghosts and visionary shades"
                                performing "their mystic rounds" near a yew tree, but does
                                not associate the scene with the Last Judgment. While frenzied
                                spirits circle about the yew in the composition, more pious types
                                parade into the church at the left. A small figure hovering just
                                above the church door holds an object in his upraised right hand
                                (the lash of Conscience?) and a figure with a lash dominates a group
                                cowering on top of the tomb, lower right. Below, graves open as the
                                "ghosts" of the dead are pulled out—or pummeled,
                                lower right—by other embodied spirits.</figDesc>

                    <p>After reading E. B. Murray’s "<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                        Reversed" in <hi rend="i">Blake Studies</hi> vol. 7 no. 1, I opened my
                        copy of Blake—conscious of imitating Blake’s use of
                        Bysshe—and began reading "The Voice of the Ancient Bard" as
                        "in a mirror, darkly." The result is not the finest poetry, but
                        note the energy of Blake’s words is not destroyed and in some cases
                        is enhanced with new meaning: "Her perplex roots tangled / there!"
                        This is not meant as an example of extending Murray’s criticism or of
                        promoting a Cabbalistic dabbling in Blake’s good book—just one
                        poet’s playful response to England’s greatest.</p>

                            ground<lb/> like grandfather clocks from the floor<lb/> like tables and
                            chairs from the parquet. Houses<lb/> are built from within, built<lb/>
                            from below, by hands<lb/> reaching up from the soil. They grow<lb/> out

                            warm white cloth. His thoughts<lb/> are so heavy. They have stuck in the
                            clothes<lb/> that are so full of thoughts<lb/> that they will never be
                            really clean again.<lb/>

                            on the bed.<lb/> Their shoes meet under the bed<lb/> in front of the
                            china pot<lb/> with the green garland of flowers. His sex<lb/> presses

                            moist cleft<lb/> where the Universe is created, slippery wet walls<lb/>
                            becoming tense and then lax. The Universe pulsates<lb/> with their

                            darkness.<lb/>
                            <lb/> Freedom comes flowing in<lb/> through their

                            chimney<lb/> kindling the fire. A gust of wind<lb/> goes through the
                            houses, shakes them<lb/> so that the pans fall down<lb/> from their
                            racks.<lb/>

                            darkness<lb/> until it too begins to breathe violently<lb/> dies and is
                            born again, is filled with light<lb/> growing up around them. Another
                            house<lb/> where the sky comes flowing blue through the windows<lb/>
                            where the clouds glide through the rooms, the floor<lb/> greens and is
                            covered with flowers<lb/> when his semen falls on it.<lb/>
                            <lb/> Quivers
                            and creaking<lb/> from the bed, soft liquid<lb/> running between their
                            thighs. For a second<lb/> it was they who made the Universe grow,<lb/>
                            who made men rise and continue their journey,<lb/> roots of trees<lb/>
                            press deeper into the earth<lb/> for water.<lb/>
                            <lb/> 3.<lb/> The same
                            grey-headed God<lb/> his muscular body covered with silvery down.<lb/>
                            The same white Goddess<lb/> made pregnant by a flow of stars.<lb/> The
                            same rain<lb/> between the furrows. The oxdriver’s cry<lb/>
                            forces the plough through the soil<lb/> with the power of brown

                            <lb/> The same sun<lb/> chained among the boughs of the
                            trees.<lb/> The same face<lb/> nailed to the trunk of a tree. The same
                            blood<lb/> on the wet clay<lb/> making everything move forward<lb/>
                            making the new Albion rise<lb/> from the sea of Time.<lb/>

                            air in the room, lighting up<lb/> the whole city. Giant cats<lb/> come
                            out of the alleys<lb/> showing the tattered men<lb/> the way
                            home.<lb/>
                            <lb/> It is the beginning of the time of the Tiger.<lb/> The
                            cries<lb/> of the masses flow in through the windows.<lb/>
                            <lb/> When the
                            walls are falling within you<lb/> the walls of the Bastille will fall.
                            When<lb/> the walls fall within us<lb/> we become a single living
                            force<lb/> that rifle bullets cannot harm<lb/> not a river but a
                            sea<lb/> like time, not a river<lb/> but a sea.<lb/>
                            <lb/> Tomorrow or a
                            thousand years from now<lb/> we will open the roof hatch<lb/> and
                            arise<lb/> our faces turned toward the sun, arise<lb/> from our
                            houses<lb/> as from murky wooden coffins. Tomorrow<lb/> or a thousand
                            years from now<lb/> we will live the lives<lb/> we were meant to live.
                            William Blake<lb/> blows out the candle. Tomorrow<lb/> we will color the
                            pictures,<lb/> he says. </q>

                    <q> There is a contradictory quality in the middle classes which makes them
                        suddenly produce artists, where nothing in the tastes, manners, or
                        aspirations of such well-ordered families might warrant the spontaneous
                        generation of personalities in no way deducible from the characters of
                        parents or kindred. It is as if the moderation, the fear of risk, the
                        clear-cut and well-tried beliefs, the cult of security and solidity in all
                        its forms, were suddenly defied—and mystified—by the daemon of
                        painting or poetry, risen among the abruptly blazed-up flames of a gentle
                        and sleepy hearth. Beings of a singular sensibility, troubled with a
                        restless will to expression, appear in the midst of a tranquil little world,
                        to astonish, sometimes to annoy, and sometimes to win it over. Perhaps this
                        should be seen as the workings of a natural law: an artist is a reaction;
                        responding to the usual with the unheard-of, detecting what is strange in
                        what is common, distilling purity from impurity by a mysterious process
                        which can take place only in the presence of all that is worn out, habitual,
                        conventional, and commonplace. Our daemon’s task is to cheat the law
                        by which habit debases all sensation.<lb/>
                        <lb/> Paul Valéry </q>
                    <p>Laurence Binyon’s introduction to the Burlington Fine Arts
                        Club’s 1927 William Blake Centenary Exhibition suggested that Blake
                        was at that time respected more as a poet than as a painter. To some extent
                        that situation prevails today, and in his introduction to the catalogue for
                        the exhibition of Blake’s work that he recently organized for the
                        Tate Gallery (9 March-21 May), Martin Butlin indicates that a primary
                        purpose of the exhibition was to focus on Blake’s achievements as a
                        visual artist as distinct from his literary achievements. To do this Butlin
                        assembled Blake’s very best work from forty-five public and private
                        collections plus several anonymous lenders. For the most part, lesser pieces
                        of an essentially historical or curious nature were not included.
                        Butlin’s long years of studying Blake served him well when he was
                        selecting the exhibition. It was extraordinarily beautiful. The clarity
                        which Blake emphasized as the aim of his art in his own 1809 <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> was apparent throughout. The exhibition
                        demonstrated clearly that Blake’s pictorial achievements may be
                        appreciated even by those who have not yet memorized <hi rend="i">A Blake
                            Dictionary</hi> ("Does he have political overtones, this William
                        Blake?" was a query overheard from one enthusiastic viewer). In fact,
                        Blake’s rich and complex range as an image maker is probably best
                        communicated by the direct and comprehensive visual contact facilitated by
                        an exhibition such as this one. Consisting of 338 works, including one by
                        Blake’s brother Robert and two by John Linnell, the exhibition was
                        hung in <pb id="p12-43" n="43"/>

                        facets of Blake’s oeuvre.</p>
                    <p>Given the large number of pieces exhibited, the many subdivisions, and the
                        visual mix of techniques, the exhibition flowed very well. Paintings,
                        drawings, watercolors, prints and book pages were hung in an integrated
                        fashion with subjects, concepts, stylistic considerations, chronology, and
                        technical distinctions all working together to reveal Blake’s truly
                        organic development as an artist. One could walk through the show and be
                        carried along strictly by the visual images before going back to probe the
                        works through their many layers, attend to scholarly considerations, make
                        comparisons, etc. The exhibition, installed under the direction of Ruth
                        Rattenbury (also of the Tate Gallery staff), was organized in seventeen
                        sections as follows: Apprenticeship and Early Work, c. 1775-85; Blake the
                        Neo-Classicist, c. 1780-90; The Early Illuminated Books and Contemporary
                        Book Illustrations, 1789-91; The Prophetic Books, 1793-96; The Large Colour
                        Prints of 1795; The Great Book Illustrations, c. 1795-98; Blake’s
                        First Works for Thomas Butts: Tempera Paintings of Biblical Subjects, c.
                        1799-1800; The Hazards of Patronage: William Hayley and "The
                        Grave," c. 1799-1806; Watercolour Illustrations to the Bible for Thomas
                        Butts, c. 1800-08; Illustrations to the Book of Job, c. 1805-25;
                        Blake’s Exhibition, "The Last Judgment" and other works, c.
                        1800-10; Illustrations to Milton and other Writers, c. 1807-20;
                        "Jerusalem," c. 1804-20; John Linnell, John Varley and the
                        Visionary Heads, c. 1819-25; Illustrations to Thornton’s Virgil,
                        1820-21; Late Tempera Paintings and Other Works, 1921-27; and Illustrations
                        to Dante, 1824-27. The hanging of the exhibition did not rigidly conform to
                        the dates of these sub-sections, however, and works of a particular theme
                        from various periods were often shown side by side. For example, the five
                        versions of <hi rend="i">Pestilence: The Great Plague of London</hi>, of
                        which the earliest dates from c. 1779-80 and the latest from c. 1805, were
                        all grouped within "Blake the Neo-Classicist, c. 1780-90."</p>
                    <p>As Blake’s stylistic development was made clear by instances of
                        thematic hanging, his proclivity for working within a serial narrative
                        framework was also to be seen, for example, in the reunion of the twelve
                        watercolors in the 1808 set to Milton’s <hi rend="i">Paradise
                            Lost</hi> ("Satan, Sin, and Death, Satan Comes to the Gates of
                        Hell" was represented by a photograph). Blake’s poetic dialogue
                        reveals his personal mythology and is paralleled in his graphic work by a
                        dialogue of formal images. The exhibition format encouraged walking back and
                        forth from section to section, comparing a composition, a figure, or a
                        setting <pb id="p12-44" n="44"/> in one work with its counterpart in
                        another. Often great shifts in emotional response were elicited; for
                        example, it is one thing to cite a relationship between the figures of Abias
                        (in the c. 1780-85 drawing after a Ghisi engraving from a Michelangelo
                        fresco) and Newton (in the color print of 1795); it is another to look at
                        the rather uninspired, somewhat flaccid figure in the early study and then
                        encounter the densely formed, powerful Newton, whose reverberations of
                        meaning within Blake’s written mythology are as important as his
                        pictorial reverberations within Blake’s art.</p>
                    <p>What one wants to do in writing a review of an exhibition of this stature is
                        to share, as much as possible, the experience of seeing it—of seeing,
                        for example, <hi rend="i">The Magdalene at the Sepulchre</hi> from the Yale
                        Center for British Art, the Petworth House <hi rend="i">Last Judgment</hi>,
                        and <hi rend="i">The Arlington Court Picture</hi> all together under one
                        roof. It is an experience of particular and unique intellectual,
                        imaginative, and sensual luxury, not easily or directly translatable into
                        words. An indirect approach aimed at accomplishing that elusive end has to
                        suffice; therefore, the following attempts an overview of the exhibition
                        within the framework of observations stimulated while seeing it.</p>
                    <p>Drawings comprised much of the early-apprenticeship section, including
                        several, drawn from Westminster Abbey monuments, not heretofore exhibited as
                        part of Blake’s oeuvre. Apart from <figure>
                            <head>Lessing J. Rosenwald views the exhibit.</head>
                        </figure> these earliest studies, among the drawings, the broadly conceived,
                        rapidly done, freely worked drawing, <hi rend="i">Young Woman Reclining on a
                            Couch</hi>, and the more incisive <hi rend="i">Fall of Fair
                            Rosamund</hi>, could be seen in contrast to such highly developed works
                        as the exquisitely delicate <hi rend="i">Resurrection of the Dead</hi>, or
                        the rather meticulous visionary heads of Blake’s late years. Of
                        particular interest were the pencil sketches for <hi rend="i">Pity</hi> and
                            <hi rend="i">Hecate</hi> which, although broadly drawn, have many of the
                        qualities of expressive totality and tautness of structure that characterize
                        the large color prints developed from them. Perhaps the most powerful
                        drawing was the <hi rend="i">Free Version of the Laocoön</hi>, which
                        acted both as an accumulation and as a culmination of features of the other
                        drawings—the very sparsely described serpents, and the more fully
                        formed figures of Adam and Satan, building up to the most explicit and
                        highly worked figure of Urizen/Jehovah whose sensuous robes flow around his
                        strongly modelled form. The three figures become a unit with icon-like
                        power.</p>
                    <p>Among the early prints was Blake’s relief etching based on his brother
                        Robert’s compelling, if almost humorously naive, drawing known as <hi rend="i">The Approach of Doom</hi> which hung near <hi rend="i">The
                            Complaint of Job</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Death of Ezekiel’s
                            Wife.</hi> These two Biblical subjects, engraved in the conventional dot
                        and lozenge technique of the period, are composed of carefully modelled
                        figures, with gestures and gazes of utmost importance to their powerful
                        expressive qualities. The figure compositions are relief-like and placed
                        within an explicit space of Neo-Classical origin. <hi rend="i">The Approach
                            of Doom</hi> print is also a highly charged image but its drama is
                        expressed mainly through the totality of the composition. With its more
                        generalized form and implied spatial infinity, the relief etching stood in
                        startling contrast to the <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi> and <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings.</p>
                    <p>The subject of Job became the focus of a later section of the exhibition that
                        included six of the twenty-one engraved <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the
                            Book of Job</hi>, 1823-26, and eight related watercolors of various
                        dates, among them two versions of <hi rend="i">Job and His Family Restored
                            to Prosperity.</hi> Three of the engravings corresponded to watercolors
                        on exhibition while others did not, thus presenting ten of the twenty-one
                        subjects, as well as an idea of the close relationship between the
                        watercolor series and the engravings. The <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings
                        represent the heights of Blake’s work in this medium. With Durer as
                        his measure, Blake wielded his burin with a sureness of hand and clarity of
                        mind yielding solidly formed images, bathed in luminosity. The narrative
                        series ranks among the most important sequences in the history of
                        engraving.</p>
                    <p>In addition to splendid engravings like the <hi rend="i">Job</hi> series,
                        Blake’s output as a commercial engraver was voluminous, a part of his
                        oeuvre which was rarely considered in the exhibition. His own <pb id="p12-45" n="45"/> designs for conventional book illustration were
                        seen in the four pen and wash drawings for Mary Wollstonecraft’s <hi rend="i">Original Stories.</hi> The stipple engravings after Watteau,
                            <hi rend="i">Morning Amusement</hi> and <hi rend="i">Evening
                            Amusement</hi>, indicate his skill as a reproductive engraver within the
                        confines of that tradition, as do three engravings from his own designs for
                        the second, 1805, edition of Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads.</hi>
                        These were placed among the "Hazards of Patronage" along with Mrs.
                        Butt’s charming needlework, <hi rend="i">Hares</hi>, the design of
                        which is attributed to Blake. Caprices of patronage were also responsible
                        for Schiavonetti’s engravings after Blake’s designs for <hi rend="i">The Grave.</hi> In a comparison of the unique impression of
                        Blake’s interpretation of his design for the "Death’s
                        Door" plate and the published one by Schiavonetti, what became most
                        apparent was Blake’s belief in the strength of his image.
                        Blake’s heroic sense of form and the gestures of his personal
                        handwriting (the descriptive marks that were peculiarly his) developed the
                        large figural tensions on which the impact of his own version is dependent.
                        The drama is heightened by the rich black areas produced by relief printing
                        a plate that had broad areas of unengraved surface. "Drama" and
                        "impact" are not really appropriate terms to use in describing
                        Schiavonetti’s interpretation. In contrast it is a rather schematic
                        and conventional engraving of an intriguing image, but one with few dramatic
                        formal properties.</p>
                    <p>Historically prints have offered particularly rich possibilities for
                        comparative study, a point repeatedly demonstrated by the prints on
                        exhibition. Some were seen in more than one state (<hi rend="i">The
                            Complaint of Job</hi>); some were seen as studies on which Blake worked
                        to develop, rethink, and extend his ideas (three of the four known and
                        greatly differing touched proofs of the <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> title page,
                        which were hung adjacent to the published version); some were seen as the
                        pages of illuminated books, used as a base to which watercolor and color
                        printing were applied with great variety of approach (pages from <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> and the same images from <hi rend="i">The Small Book of Designs</hi>). Progressions like these, along with
                        the sketches and drawings related to more finished prints and paintings (two
                        preliminary drawings, a trial print, and one of two known finished versions
                        of <hi rend="i">Pity</hi>), and the instances of works in more than one
                        version (<hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</hi>),
                        added up to an exhibition that was didactic almost in spite of itself. The
                        mind of the artist at work is always best studied through this kind of
                        material.</p>
                    <p>While patronage did have its hazards, the positive importance of both Thomas
                        Butts and John Linnell is evidenced by Blake’s prodigious output
                        during the years of their support. The Tate exhibition included seven
                        temperas painted for Butts during the 1799-1800 period. Mainly of Biblical
                        subjects, many of them, unfortunately, are irretrievably darkened because of
                        Blake’s peculiar use of carpenter’s glue as a binder for his
                        pigment. Still quite bright, however, is the very gentle <hi rend="i">Our
                            Lady with the Infant Jesus Riding on a Lamb.</hi> Like many of
                        Blake’s paintings of the period, it is <figure>

                        </figure> characterized by a planar, frieze-like grouping of figures set
                        before a deep landscape space.</p>
                    <p>There was only one true landscape in the exhibition, the lovely watercolor,
                            <hi rend="i">Landscape near Felpham</hi> (with sunlight, the light of
                        poetic inspiration, to be sure, shining down on Blake’s cottage), but
                        Blake’s response to the landscape could be repeatedly observed,
                        notably in <hi rend="i">Ruth, the Dutiful Daughter-in-law</hi> and the
                        striking, moonlit night scene of <hi rend="i">Malevolence.</hi>
                        Blake’s landscapes were far closer to the pastoral tradition of
                        Claude, whom he admired, than that of the heroic or sublime landscape of,
                        for example, his contemporary De Loutherbourg. Often, as in the freely
                        laid-in setting for the Ruth subject, the landscapes appeared to be
                        generalized descriptions of particular places with a focus on mood; in other
                        instances, perhaps most pointedly in the abundant landscape elements in the
                        Milton <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> watercolors, Blake made
                        particularized depictions of generalized natural forms.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Book of
                            Urizen</hi> preceded Blake’s large color prints of c. 1795. With
                            <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi>, which contained several full-page
                        images, designs gained importance in relation to text, and Blake became
                        immersed in his color-printing technique. The reticulated textures of
                        Blake’s color printing imply weight and density, pictorial qualities
                        that are indeed sympathetic to Blake’s growing pessimism. These
                        qualities were reduced or amplified depending upon the luminosity of
                        particular colors, the thickness of the color layer (in this
                        monoprint-related technique the earliest of several impressions of an image
                        would have the thickest layer of pigment), and the number of layers of
                        colors. Of additional importance was the way colors were placed in proximity
                        to one another. For instance, in <hi rend="i">Elohim Creating Adam</hi> the
                        forcefulness of the image is heightened by the rich blues which describe the
                        background space and press the figure grouping forward. All of the color
                        prints have additional work in watercolor and pen and ink. How much work <pb id="p12-46" n="46"/>

                        versions of an image. The variables were clearly to be seen in the three
                        impressions of <hi rend="i">God Judging Adam.</hi> The watercolor washes,
                        sometimes transparent, but often made translucent or opaque by the use of
                        body color, were used for various purposes, such as adding solidity to large
                        sale forms by gently modelling them, and to soften distinctions between
                        areas of the image. For instance, watercolor was used in <hi rend="i">Elohim
                            Creating Adam</hi> to give greater unity to Adam’s leg and the
                        worm that entwines it. Lines in watercolor and pen and ink were used in
                        finishing the color prints to refine and enhance form in much the same way
                        that Blake used the pen to further define aspects of his watercolors. To use
                        the same work as an example, linear elements particularized forms and made
                        them more incisive, as with Elohim’s hands, facial features, beard,
                        hair, etc. As a group, the large color prints are intensely dramatic, the
                        power of the images consistently reinforced by eerie qualities of light.</p>
                    <p>At least one version of each of the twelve subjects was included in the
                        exhibition, and in them the intense pessimism expressed in <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> is given full visual form. They repay lengthy and careful
                        scrutiny: color printing thickly and thinly applied; numerous layers of
                        color reworked with transparent or opaque watercolors; accents of painted
                        and/or drawn lines; textures which vary in density; highly modelled forms
                        placed next to flat areas of color; pictorial space implied and denied;
                        generalities of a Neo-Classical nature juxtaposed with very personalized
                        conceptions; layered compositions layered with meaning. This rich visual
                        world becomes hideously diluted when discussed in terms of technical
                        analysis; and, in fact, Blake was certainly to reach equally expressive
                        heights with far less technical complexity in the Dante watercolors of his
                        last years.</p>
                    <p>Two major watercolor projects closely followed the large color prints. Seven
                        of Blake’s 116 illustrations to Gray’s <hi rend="i">Poems</hi>
                        were on view, with the satirical, humorous third illustration to "Ode
                        on the Death of a Favorite Cat" a high point. This set was commissioned
                        by John Flaxman for his wife, both apparently admirers of Blake’s
                        illustrations to Edward Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts.</hi>
                        Twenty-one of the 537 watercolors (about one-fourth of Blake’s known
                        oeuvre) for that aborted project (only forty-three were actually engraved by
                        Blake) were on view. The range of Young’s subject and mood was
                        extended to express Blake’s own world view, one which was far more
                        interesting and expansive than Young’s. One <hi rend="i">Night
                            Thoughts</hi> illustration refers back to the drawing <hi rend="i">Warring Angels: Michael Contending with Satan</hi> of the
                        1780’s, and another, the title page to "Night the Eighth,"
                        foretells the <hi rend="i">Apocalypse</hi> watercolor of 1809, or "The
                        Harlot and the Giant" in the "Purgatorio" illustrations for
                        Dante. Death mowing down an assembled throng, rebirth symbolized by the
                        butterfly and the cocoon, Christianity symbolized by the vine, and the
                        serpent of materialism, were all to be found as well. The transparency of
                        watercolor at its most fluid and luminous was seen in "The Queen of
                        Heaven walking in brightness," in contrast to the watercolor layers of
                        darker-hued, more dryly applied paint that added up to form "The Whore
                        of Babylon astride the Seven Headed Beast." Fanciful in the context of
                        Blake’s art, these illustrations give clues to his witty and
                        satirical nature. They also show his developing powers as a
                        watercolorist.</p>
                    <p>One was able to see individual figures and entire compositions developed,
                        revised, and refined throughout the exhibition, an exhibition being the best
                        vehicle for making such things apparent. Blake’s all-encompassing
                        themes repeatedly <pb id="p12-51" n="51"/> reappeared—The Creation,
                        The Fall, Judgment, Salvation, War, Death, to name just a few. His
                        vocabulary, his signs and symbols, were encountered again and
                        again—the flames of eternal fury or of inspiration, the Egyptian
                        pyramids of materialism, the worm of mortality, the musical instruments of
                        creative activity. Compositional structures repeatedly
                        recur—icon-like, emblematic, vertically symmetrical formats; layered
                        horizontal bands; compartmentalized compositions which become mosaics of
                        images; or schemata that depend on an open swirling gesture. The figure of
                        the Bard, himself, reappears in many guises.</p>
                    <p>Blake made illustrations for Miltonic and Biblical themes throughout his
                        career. Comparison of early and late versions of <hi rend="i">Paradise
                            Lost</hi> subjects, or <hi rend="i">The Parable of the Wise and Foolish
                            Virgins</hi>, made clear some of the changes that took place in his
                        style. In later versions less emphasis was placed on overly dramatic and
                        schematized facial expressions; compositions focused less on particular
                        figures or groupings; color harmonies tended to be less delicate and/or
                        monochromatic. Rather, the power of many of the later images comes from
                        their more integrated compositions, organized by means of a flickering
                        quality of light that fractures and activates forms modelled <figure/> with
                        rich, densely painted areas of color. Generally Blake’s later drawing
                        style is freer and more open.</p>
                    <p>Also shown were pages from both the unique complete colored Copy E and Copy B
                        of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Blake’s last and longest illuminated
                        book. The unique impression of the frontispiece before he deleted the
                        inscriptions, and the published state of this plate, as well as two
                        impressions of the title page, encouraged comparisons. Blake’s
                        illuminated books were colored throughout his lifetime. Those colored in his
                        later years (regardless of when the plates were actually made) are far more
                        elaborate than the earlier ones. In late versions, as in his late
                        watercolors, he used more complex color relationships, usually composed of
                        small patches of rich color, as distinct from the broadly applied, delicate
                        washes of the earlier work. Colors within the areas of text more fully
                        integrated the text with the illustrations, and gold was sometimes employed
                        for increased sumptuousness. This could be vividly seen in the title page of
                            <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copy E.</p>
                    <p>The exhibition closed with nineteen of Blake’s 102 watercolors to
                        Dante, as well as two of the seven engravings from them. The ten watercolors
                        for the "Inferno" were generally the most highly finished and
                        dramatic; seven for "Purgatorio" were shown, and four for
                        "Paradiso," which as a group were the most freely sketch-like,
                        with pronounced broad linear structures, at times like a kind of suggestive
                        shorthand. The freedom with which Blake used color in these watercolors was
                        <figure/> heightened by his use of line. In earlier works, such as the 1808
                            <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> series, line essentially functioned to
                        confine color. In these late pieces, its role became increasingly complex,
                        creating pathways on many levels through the compositions. Blake’s
                        Dante watercolors which illustrate, parallel, and comment on <hi rend="i">The Divine Comedy</hi> are also <pb id="p12-52" n="52"/>
                        <figure/> a summation of his own visual dialogue, the summation of his
                        "cycle of spiritual experience," to use a phrase of Albert S.
                        Roe’s. Contraries, so important to Blake, abound: stasis and
                        activity, tenderness and terror, implication and finish. The ecstasy of an
                        imagination fully liberated after years of trying to give it definition is
                        apparent throughout the series. Sweeping lines define compositions and then
                        accumulate to become form; patches of color, freely washed in, behave
                        similarly. In some of the more finished examples, a stipple technique builds
                        to a density similar in effect to the reticulated surfaces of the earlier
                        large color prints. The settings, the situations, and then the details work
                        together to evoke various expressive moods. These watercolors must have been
                        a culmination for Blake just as, 150 years later, Matisse’s late
                        cutouts were a culmination of his own work. In both instances, ideas of a
                        lifetime were summarized and reflected upon, and new ones were introduced.
                        Descriptions of each of these two masters spiritedly at work in his sick-bed
                        have marked similarities.</p>
                    <p>An obvious advantage of having this Blake exhibition at the Tate Gallery was
                        that in the permanent collection one could study paintings by Fuseli,
                        Stothard, Flaxman and Mortimer, and also additional works by Blake and his
                        followers. Directly outside of the Blake exhibition itself was a display of
                        works by his contemporaries, including Stothard’s version of <hi rend="i">Chaucer’s Canterbury Pilgrims</hi>, and works by the
                        younger circle of Blake’s admirers, as well as later <figure/>
                        English painters and printmakers, some of whom, such as Paul Nash and Cecil
                        Collins, at least in the examples presented, seemed to be out of place.</p>
                    <p>Every exhibition reflects to some extent the taste and biases of the person
                        who selected it; everyone else who sees the exhibition probably draws a
                        desiderata list of what they’d have included. One can be rather
                        certain in this instance, however, that many works one missed were missing
                        because of institutional lending policies, as in the case of works from the
                        Huntington Library, or restrictions attached to certain collections such as
                        works from the Grenville Winthrop Collection at the Fogg Museum. Other loan
                        requests would have been turned down for any number of reasons. For example,
                        many <figure/> of the tempera paintings are too fragile to travel,
                        presumably the reason for a particularly sad lacuna, the tempera of <hi rend="i">Chaucer’s Canterbury Pilgrims</hi> in Pollok House,
                        Glasgow. This subject was included in a unique hand-colored first state
                        impression of Blake’s engraving from it. The Tate actually was
                        extremely fortunate to assemble eleven temperas in addition to the nine
                        shown from their own collection. Several of the latter were cleaned
                        especially for the exhibition (late ones like <hi rend="i">The Body of Abel
                            Found by Adam and Eve</hi> were brilliant in their luminosity but
                        earlier ones like <hi rend="i">The Spiritual Form of Pitt Guiding
                            Behemoth</hi> were cleaned with far less success because of
                        Blake’s use of fugitive materials).</p>
                    <p>Given what Martin Butlin aptly refers to as the flood of Blake literature,
                        one can sympathize with his decision to avoid crowding the entries of an
                        exhibition catalogue directed to the general <pb id="p12-53" n="53"/> public
                        with specialized scholarly information available elsewhere (exhibition
                        history, listings of all related works, full provenance, etc.). His well
                        organized bibliography was selected with an acute awareness of the most
                        useful literature, including his own comprehensive catalogue of
                        Blake’s paintings, drawings, and separate color prints which is to be
                        published by Trianon Press for the William Blake Trust (which co-sponsored
                        the Tate exhibition) later this year. This publication will undoubtedly
                        provide a new standard of reference to these aspects of Blake’s
                        oeuvre. In his cogent introductory essay, in the overviews that precede each
                        section of catalogue entries, and in the entries themselves Butlin gives a
                        splendidly complete picture of Blake’s art. The entries were brief
                        and clear enough to be read by scholar and non-scholar alike while viewing
                        the exhibition, as well as re-read and mulled over afterwards. Most of the
                        longer <figure/> entries contain relevant quotations from Blake’s own
                        descriptive writings or from his poetry. Butlin was able to weave together a
                        wealth of information of endless variety—bibliographical data, the
                        social history of England, Biblical and literary synopsis, Blake’s
                        life, his mythology, the complex relationships between his writing and his
                        visual art, technical information, stylistic analysis, reasons for dating,
                        especially interesting provenances, the history of collecting in England and
                        America, issues of scholarly disagreement, and so forth, developing as he
                        went along a rich body of references between works of art, just as the
                        exhibition itself did.</p>
                    <p>The catalogue reproduces everything in the exhibition as well as twenty-one
                        illustrations of other works of art which supplement the text and <figure/>
                        <figure/> help to demonstrate Blake’s relationships with
                        contemporaries (e.g. Romney, Hamilton, West), as well as to some degree, the
                        range of Blake’s art-historical connections (e.g. Poussin, Raphael,
                        Dürer). Given the small scale of the reproductions (about 2 ×
                        2 ½"), they are for the most part quite clear, and one can
                        assume that the variation in quality depended on the variation in
                        photographs available for reproduction from lending institutions. There are
                        also sixteen full-page color plates, and it is especially pleasant to note
                        sensitivity to the scale of the works of art—the color plates of
                        Blake’s book pages are not blown up to fill the catalogue pages, a
                        recent practice which destroys the delicacy and clarity of such small
                        images. Reproductions of verso images would have been a splendid addition to
                        the catalogue (especially as the forthcoming William Blake Trust catalogue
                        will not be comprehensively illustrated), but presumably there were just too
                        many of them for this to have been given serious consideration. Although the
                        price inevitably is to go up after the close of the exhibition, the
                        catalogue is, and will probably remain, the book bargain of the year. At the
                        exhibition it sold for £1.80, softcover, and £3.00, hardcover.</p>
                    <p>There was one printing mix-up; the catalogue entry for #67 was repeated for
                        #68. The latter should read: <pb id="p12-54" n="54"/>
                        <figure/>

                            This copy of the print is generally identified as that which, according
                            to J. T. Smith and Frederick Tatham, Blake coloured for Tatham on his
                            deathbed. It is however exceedingly difficult to read the last digit of
                            the date, if indeed it is a date, as a seven. The print is nevertheless
                            typical of Blake’s late rich elaborate colouring, including the
                            use of gold. It seems to be from the later state of the engraving, that
                            actually used in copies of <hi rend="i">Europe.</hi>
                        </q>
                    </p>
                    <p>Needless to say, all of the old questions about Blake’s art are not
                        answered with the exhibition, and new ones are raised. For example, the
                        three versions of <hi rend="i">God Creating The Universe, The Ancient of
                            Days</hi> do indeed make one wonder if they all could have been printed
                        from the same plate, the relief-printed lines of the clouds so differed from
                        impression to impression; and one does have to be curious about the rather
                        meticulous watercolor study of a serpent which, as Mr. Butlin indicates,
                        corresponds to none of Blake’s serpents. Neither does it seem to
                        correspond in style to any of Blake’s other studies.</p>
                    <p>For the most part, Blake’s works are small in scale. He not only
                        hovers between the worlds of literature and art, but, within the world of
                        art, suffers because so many of his best, or best known, works are printed.
                        This fact often eliminates an artist from standard art-history surveys, to
                        be included only in studies of the history of prints—at one time
                        considered by some to be second-string art history. The catalogue for the
                        1939 Philadelphia Museum of Art’s Blake exhibition introduced the
                        paintings section as follows: "Blake was not a painter in the accepted
                        sense of the term since he never really mastered the technique of oil
                        painting." "Accepted," of course, is the operative word.</p>
                    <p>Developments within the contemporary art world have made Blake more palatable
                        and perhaps more accessible. Boundaries are by necessity being broken down
                        between catagories, making color-printed drawings more easily
                        "acceptable" to an art public. None of this alters Blake’s
                        work, but rather presents the possibility that a Blake exhibition in the
                        year 2027 won’t have to be introduced again with the propostion that
                        it aims to demonstrate Blake’s importance as a visual artist. To use
                        the last sentence of Martin Butlin’s introduction, "Of his
                        [Blake’s] greatness as a complete man there can be no doubt; nor, it
                        is here claimed, should there be any doubt about his greatness as an
                        artist."</p>

                    <p>The essential argument of John Howard’s monograph on <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> is given on p. 13: <q> It is with Blake’s view of
                            the process of [the psychic fall and redemption characteristic of long
                            Romantic poems] that we are concerned here. Blake’s vision of the
                            fall and redemption offers a way of talking about the
                            individual’s "spiritual" makeup, a way of mapping out
                            the architecture and landscape of the personality. Blake describes how
                            the personality permits its own instincts of fear to imprison its
                            creativity in delusion, an imprisonment that lasts until its creativity
                            reasserts itself in a defiant act of self-annihilation. This
                            imprisonment and subsequent freedom are embodied in his vision of the
                            fall and redemption in <hi rend="i">Milton.</hi> . . . . The imprisoning
                            instincts he called the selfhood, which is a false covering over the
                            immortal spirit. Blake saw the selfhood as survival-oriented,
                            manifesting itself as a hold-fast defense mechanism toward exterior
                            reality as well as repressive enchainments of the creativity within. But
                            Blake’s view of the selfhood encompassed even more. Because he
                            believed that the exterior world is an emanation of the immortal,
                            creative part of personality, his concept of the selfhood also
                            encompassed all the defensive structures of society and man’s
                            history. </q>
                    </p>
                    <p>The psychological orientation of Howard’s study produces some fresh
                        insights into some of the individual passages he comments on, but I think on
                        the whole it is limited by an assumption that comes perilously close to
                        saying that Romantic poetry, which wanted to express the conflict between
                        the imprisoning selfhood and the impulse toward free creativity and full
                        realization of the integrated personality, might not have been written at
                        all—or at least would not have taken the form it did—if the
                        age had developed a psychological language adequate to express this
                        conflict: "The psychological language necessary to express the conflict
                        between these two forces of personality had not yet been created, and only
                        in the imaginative analogies of poetry could a successful vehicle be found.
                        But the age certainly had a need for such language. Without it, the writer
                        could only project his undelineated feelings onto exterior phenomena, and
                        describe those phenomena in a way that relfected his but semi-conscious
                        feelings" (pp. 13-14). Specifically concerning Blake in this context,
                        Howard adds: "Though Blake had no readymade language to reveal how
                        these objective symbols [that projected the semi-conscious feelings] were
                        reflections of interior states of mind, he had certainly become aware of the
                        phenomenon, and his task was to put together a language and poetic structure
                        that could express what he saw. He called it <hi rend="i">sublime
                            allegory</hi>" (p. 14). Poetry in <pb id="p12-57" n="57"/>
                        Howard’s esthetic is very much in the service of "concept"
                        or idea, which could be expressed more directly if only an adequate language
                        had been developed for it. And Blake’s "tool" for
                        expressing his "concept of reality" was the symbol (p. 15).</p>
                    <p>Howard’s conception of Blake’s myth as expressing the conflicts
                        within an individual personality I find disturbingly limiting and
                        misleading, and this is not really compensated for by his effort to expand
                        the idea of selfhood to society and its institutions in his notion of the
                        "exterior" selfhood. To be sure, the idea can be supported by
                        selection from among the most condensed utterances from Blake’s text.
                        But it seems to me that the things that crystalize and institutionalize the
                        selfhood are not identical with the selfhood but extensions of it, results
                        of its operation. And the opposite of the selfhood is not, as Howard
                        suggests, creativity but an opening out of the self into relationship and
                        full identification with humanity and divinity, which may be brought about
                        by the creativity of apocalyptic and visionary art like Blake’s and
                        which would create the conditions for the continued production of art that
                        expresses the whole life of man. But I think in this context that the much
                        abused term "creativity" is not very useful or accurate. Though by
                        the time he wrote and designed <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> Blake had greatly
                        expanded his earlier idea of the selfhood, it still seems to me that it is
                        consistent with its appearance in poems like "The Clod and the
                        Pebble" and the opening chapters of <hi rend="i">The Book of
                            Urizen.</hi> As elaborated, I’m not sure Howard’s always
                        is. After many years of acquaintance with Blake, I still find afresh, in
                        various personal difficulties, psychological illuminations that are simply
                        amazing. But I think it is wrong to posit that the whole of Blake’s
                        myth expresses a "landscape and architecture of the
                        personality."</p>
                    <p>Fortunately, when Howard works with specific passages in the text, the power
                        of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> usually overwhelms his esthetic, and he talks
                        about the poetry in a way that doesn’t reflect the limitations in his
                        theory. But he does talk about the poetry only, and in the general context
                        of its ideas.</p>
                    <p>This is a book which might have been written two or three decades ago, before
                        Blake criticism began fully to direct attention to the illuminated books as
                        composite art. It is still possible to focus critically on Blake’s
                        text alone, especially in the lyrics, without at every point in the
                        discussion bringing in the designs, especially when they do little more than
                        illustrate. Or on the designs alone. But in 1976 a full scale critical study
                        of a gorgeous and pregnantly illuminated work of composite art like <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, even one giving special attention to a theme as
                        this one does, must not ignore the total form in which Blake developed his
                        theme. A reader of this book who knew nothing else about Blake would be
                        quite astonished to discover what kind of work <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>
                        really is.</p>
                    <p>Though Howard’s study in general follows the pattern of the fall and
                        redemption and hence the overall pattern of the narrative of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (with chapters on "The Spiritual World,"
                        "Fall into Selfhood," "The Blossoming of the Selfhood,"
                        "Regeneration," "The Journey: Background," and finally
                        "The Journey"), it is not a <hi rend="i">seratim</hi> reading or
                        critical commentary on it. It is really a study for someone who already
                        knows the work pretty well and would, I think, be quite confusing to the
                        uninitiated.</p>
                    <p>A pair of characteristically vigorous articles by Karl Kiralis and John E.
                        Grant, both deriving from papers at the 1975 MLA meeting, consider,
                        respectively, Blake’s illustrations for Milton’s <hi rend="i">L’Allegro</hi> and <hi rend="i">Il Penseroso</hi> and plates 42,
                        48, 49, and 50 of <hi rend="i">Milton.</hi> The articles are included in a
                        Festschrift for Arthur E. Barker. Kiralis, in "Blake’s Criticism
                        of Milton’s <hi rend="i">L’Allegro</hi> and <hi rend="i">Il
                            Penseroso</hi> and of Its Author" (pp. 46-77 of the volume, with
                        twelve plates), disagrees with other critics in arguing that in these
                        illustrations Blake shows that Milton was still "too indoctrinated by
                        society’s rational forces to the false ideals of the Female Will,
                        especially Deism, and too sexually repressed to search for true experience .
                        . . for Blake yet to hope for Milton’s salvation and consequent
                        prophetic writing" (p. 77). Buttressing the discursive argument is a
                        commentary that reads the meaning of the illustrations—plausibly, I
                        think.</p>
                    <p>Grant, in "The Female Awakening at the End of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>: A Picture Story with Questions" (pp. 78-99,
                        with three plates), first raises some theoretical "alignments" in
                        relationships between "a poet and a visual artist," "the
                        writer Milton and the writer and visual artist Blake," "of Blake
                        as designer of <hi rend="i">Milton: A Poem</hi> and as illustrator of John
                        Milton’s poems," and "the writer Blake and the visual
                        artist Blake in a poem entitled <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>," and then
                        goes on to ask a number of suggestive questions about the plates intended to
                        evoke a reading of the sequence of plates that makes coherent sense, as he
                        thinks Blake’s plates do if responsibly examined. The article ends
                        with some briefly suggested answers.</p>

                    <p>The Romantic Period was less an age of feeling than the reaction against an
                        age of feeling. By 1790 the case for sensibility had been made all too well.
                        The Romantics may have talked about poetry as "the spontaneous overflow
                        of powerful feeling" and "the lava of the imagination whose
                        eruption prevents an earth-quake," and they may have dreamt of "a
                        Life of Sensations rather than Thoughts," but what they did was turn
                        back from the heart to the mind. The masterpieces of the first quarter of
                        the nineteenth century—<hi rend="i">The Prelude</hi> and <hi rend="i">Don Juan, Pride and Prejudice</hi> and <hi rend="i">Waverley</hi>—speak to people who think as deeply as they feel.
                        Perhaps the Imagination itself appealed to the Romantics because with it
                        they could close up the rift that had opened in the eighteenth century
                        between intellect and emotion: the Imagination was preeminently a faculty of
                        the active, creative mind.</p>
                    <p>In the last decades of the eighteenth century, already dissatisfied or just
                        bored with the cult of feeling, writers of differing intentions and
                        sympathies struggled with the problem that the Romantics later solved
                        triumphantly. The sentimental had reached a kind of apogee in Fanny
                        Burney’s <hi rend="i">Evelina</hi> (1778): reunited with the father
                        who had deserted her and her mother when she was an infant, Evelina falls
                        weeping to her knees five times in a single conversation, and her repentant
                        father, also in tears, kneels three times and stays down longer. A few
                        minutes of crying can atone for sixteen years of neglect. In <hi rend="i">Northanger Abbey</hi> and <hi rend="i">Sense and Sensibility</hi> Jane
                        Austen attacks this kind of absurd sentimentalism, and in <hi rend="i">The
                            Prelude</hi> Wordsworth acknowledges the temporary attraction of a
                        system of values that resembles Austen’s at its simplest: "the
                        philosophy / That promised to abstract the hopes of man / Out of his
                        feelings" (1805 text, X.807-09) appealed because it substituted reason
                        for emotion. The writers of Gothic fiction—"Monk" Lewis and
                        Ann Radcliffe, in particular—found a different escape from
                        sensibility; they gave their readers the horrors of Catholicism and
                        superstition, but created characters with enlightened Protestant
                        intelligences to experience, analyze, and often even explain the terrors.
                        Another group of novelists, the English Jacobins, wrote fiction with
                        sensational plots in order to reach their readers’ heads through
                        their hearts.</p>
                    <p>We must see Mary Wollstonecraft in this context, as a writer and thinker
                        trying to patch up the split between mind and heart, and succeeding, like
                        most of her contemporaries, only partially. Neither her character nor her
                        background did as much to shape her ideas and her work as the intellectual
                        climate she lived in. It is not a criticism to say that she was a creature
                        of her age; so were Fanny Burney and Ann Radcliffe, William Godwin and
                        William Blake. Like them, Wollstonecraft was challenged by the artificial
                        separation of thought and feeling. The new editions of her work reveal both
                        what she achieved and what she struggled against. The confusions of her less
                        successful efforts make them interesting even in failure.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">Mary, A Fiction</hi> (1788)—actually a glamorized
                        autobiography—was Wollstonecraft’s second publication. (The
                        first was <hi rend="i">Thoughts on the Education of Daughters</hi>,
                        published in 1787.) With no real interest in characterization or setting,
                        dialogue or action, she pushes her story along in short chapters of flat,
                        undeveloped narration. The heroine is supposed to have "thinking
                        powers" (p. xxxi), but after every effort to act according to
                        considered principles of virtue and humanity, she collapses into
                        self-pitying grief. Separated from a despised husband, deprived by death of
                        the woman and man she most loves, Mary settles in the country to practice
                        "benevolence and religion," and to take comfort in the knowledge
                        that "[h]er delicate state of health did not promise long life"
                        (p. 68). Having inherited the values of her age, Wollstonecraft may have
                        feared that Mary would lose the reader’s sympathy if she thought a
                        little more and felt a little less.</p>

                        husband William Godwin published in her <hi rend="i">Posthumous Works</hi>
                        (1798). <hi rend="i">Mary</hi> had been written just before she lost her
                        position as a governess and began to support herself by writing; <hi rend="i">The Wrongs of Woman</hi> was written nine years later, at the
                        end of her career. Maria is stronger, braver, and wiser than the miserable
                        Mary. The writing is more skillful, too, with a group of first-person
                        narratives giving some life to the singleminded pursuit of didactic points.
                        And the novel’s scheme is far more ambitious: drawing not only on her
                        own experiences and her family’s but also on a wide range of reading,
                        Wollstonecraft shows how men legally rob women, tyrannize over them, force
                        them into prostitution, take away their children. She tries to shock her
                        audience, and to a certain extent she succeeds. The heroine defends her
                        lover when he is tried for having seduced her; she argues that no adultery
                        took place because her husband by his cruelty, degeneracy, and greed had
                        forfeited his right to her loyalty. But there are suggestions that
                        Maria’s passion for her lover is not the virtuous impulse of a
                        generous heart but only sentimental self-delusion: " . . . pity,
                        sorrow, and solitude all conspired to soften her mind, and nourish romantic
                        wishes, and, from a natural progress, romantic expectations" (p. 98).
                        One version of the notes for completing this unfinished work reads:
                        "Divorced by her husband—Her lover
                        unfaithful—Pregnancy—Miscarriage—Suicide" (p.
                        202). But a conclusion along these lines would have made Maria entirely the
                        victim of men’s deceit. Wollstonecraft was too much a product of the
                        Age of Sensibility to create a heroine who was blameable for letting her
                        heart control her head. Maria’s emotional susceptibility was, like
                        Mary’s, an essential part of her virtue. In her fiction
                        Wollstonecraft could not find a substitute for the <pb id="p12-60" n="60"/>
                        sentimental belief in the value of feeling for its own sake. <hi rend="i">Mary</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Wrongs of Woman</hi> thus have less
                        interest for readers of fiction than for students of the social and
                        intellectual history of the late eighteenth century. What is striking about
                        both works is the way in which Wollstonecraft willingly sinks her heroines
                        in a morass of feeling.</p>

                        <hi rend="i">Letters Written during a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and
                            Denmark</hi> (1796) is similarly interesting for what it is not. The
                        most impressive thing about the volume is probably its origin in the journey
                        to Scandinavia that Wollstonecraft made, accompanied only by her
                        one-year-old daughter and a French nursemaid. She went on business for her
                        American lover, Gilbert Imlay, the baby’s father. His infidelity had
                        driven her to attempt suicide in the spring of 1795, and he sent her to
                        Scandinavia that summer as a distraction. His plan didn’t work, for
                        soon after her return she made a second attempt and very nearly
                        succeeded.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="i">Letters from Sweden</hi> were addressed to Imlay but written
                        for publication. The book reveals Wollstonecraft at her worst, trying to
                        impress two different audiences—her lover and the book’s
                        buyers—with two different things, her sensibility and her
                        intelligence. She struggles to show how seriously she thinks and how
                        tenderly she feels: "Amongst the peasantry, there is . . . so much of
                        the simplicity of the golden age in this land of flint—so much
                        overflowing of heart, and fellow-feeling, that only benevolence, and the
                        honest sympathy of nature, diffused smiles over my countenance when they
                        kept me standing, regardless of my fatigue, whilst they dropped courtesy
                        after courtesy" (p. 12). This letter, written the day after her
                        landing, shows her straining to utter universal truths about the
                        "peasantry"; at the same time she expresses the warmth of her
                        disposition, thus letting Imlay know what a loving heart he is throwing
                        away. At one point she announces, "I am persuaded that I have formed a
                        very just opinion of the character of the Norwegians, without being able to
                        hold converse with them" (p. 78), and she smugly consoles herself for
                        not knowing the language: "As their minds were totally uncultivated, I
                        did not lose much, perhaps gained, by not being able to understand
                        them" (p. 79). She seems to be a combination of Marianne Dashwood and
                        Elizabeth Bennet’s priggish piano-playing sister Mary. On the
                        occasions when she forgets to be at once an unusual woman, who reasons
                        vigorously, and an ideal woman, who feels strongly, she writes better:
                        "A mistaken tenderness . . . for their children, makes them, even in
                        summer, load them with flannels; and, having a sort of natural antipathy to
                        cold water, the squalid appearance of the poor babes, not to speak of the
                        noxious smell which flannel and rugs retain, seems a reply to a question I
                        had often asked—Why I did not see more children in the villages I
                        passed through" (p. 33). But the letters do not often give us what they
                        give us here, a vivid impression either of what she saw in Scandinavia or of
                        the person who saw it.</p>
                    <p>A more interesting woman emerges from the private and unpretentious
                        correspondence published in <hi rend="i">Godwin &amp; Mary</hi> Of the 151
                        letters—106 published whole or in part for the first time in this
                        edition, <figure/>
                        <pb id="p12-61" n="61"/> a reprint of the 1966 original—only 42 are
                        Godwin’s. The correspondence is largely an exchange of invitations
                        before meetings and of explanations after them. (There are a great many
                        explanations here.) Since Godwin and Wollstonecraft maintained separate
                        lives even after their marriage, the correspondence takes them from the
                        beginning of their love affair, in July 1796, right up to the birth of their
                        daughter on 30 August 1797, ten days before Wollstonecraft’s death.
                        While few of the letters are interesting by themselves, the whole sequence
                        lets us watch an unusual understanding develop between the
                        thirty-seven-year-old Wollstonecraft, who had been rejected by her lover,
                        and the forty-year-old Godwin, who had just been turned down by another
                        woman. Even the circumstantial details of life that are missing in
                        Wollstonecraft’s fiction appear here: "I was splashed up to my
                        knees yesterday, and to sit several hours in that state is intolerable. . .
                        . [I]t snows, so incessantly, that I do not know how I shall be able to keep
                        my appointment this evening. What say you? But you have no petticoats to
                        dangle in the snow" (pp. 60, 62). Easily offended and depressed,
                        subject to feelings of neglect and fits of jealousy, Wollstonecraft was
                        capable of undemanding affection: "I wish you, from my soul, to be
                        rivetted in my heart; but I do not desire to have you always at my
                        elbow—though at this moment [Godwin had left London three days
                        earlier] I did not care if you were" (p. 83). She manages to explain
                        her excessive sensitivity: "One reason, I believe, why I wish you to
                        have a good opinion of me is a conviction <figure>

                        40). In these letters we can see the intelligent woman she must have been.
                        Godwin’s criticism of her writing at first hurts her into
                        defensiveness: "I am compelled to think that there is some thing in my
                        writings more valuable, than in the productions of some people on whom you
                        bestow warm eulogiums—I mean more mind . . . " (p. 28). Eleven
                        days later she gives in: " . . . yet now you have led me to discover
                        that I write worse, than I thought I did, there is no stopping
                        short—I must improve, or be dissatisfied with myself—"
                        (p. 35). Energy, independence, professionalism, come through in these
                        letters, for Wollstonecraft was sure of her own voice and of her audience;
                        she felt no compulsion to parade either her intelligence or her
                        sensibility.</p>
                    <p>And that, finally, is the reason for the success of her masterpiece, <hi rend="i">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</hi> (1792): she had a
                        clear sense of herself and of her audience. Repetitious and unsystematic the
                        work may be, but it is also compelling. The very evidence that she wrote it
                        rapidly is proof of the strength of her mind as well as of her feelings; as
                        she said in the <hi rend="i">Letters from Sweden</hi>, "we reason
                        deeply, when we forcibly feel" (p. 160). Her rhetorical ploy works:
                        " . . . frankly acknowledging the inferiority of women" in their
                        oppressed condition, she argues "that men have increased that
                        inferiority" (p. 119), making them unnecessarily weak, stupid, and
                        frivolous. After attacking Rousseau and others who theorized about
                        women’s education, she sets forth her own notions: that <pb id="p12-62" n="62"/>

                        </figure> women should exercise their minds and bodies in youth as boys do,
                        and should share responsibility for the management of their homes in
                        adulthood. The latter argument is not unliberated, for she believed domestic
                        occupations offered men as well as women the best chance to be happy and
                        virtuous. She tried not "to leave the line of mediocrity" (p. 138)
                        and therefore talked about the lives of ordinary people, believing that the
                        talented of both sexes would seek other kinds of achievement if they were
                        free to do so. In <hi rend="i">The Rights of Woman</hi> she does not
                        over-simplify as she does in <hi rend="i">The Wrongs of Woman</hi>: if women
                        are the victims of men, whose bad laws, bad education, and bad religion
                        stifle them, women are also more or less willing collaborators in their own
                        degradation.</p>
                    <p>Only near the end of the work does Wollstone-craft mention political
                        equality: "I may excite laughter, by dropping a hint, which I mean to
                        pursue, some future time, for I really think that women ought to have
                        representatives, instead of being arbitrarily governed without any direct
                        share allowed them in the deliberation of government" (pp. 259-60).
                        Energetic and confident in developing the arguments that interest her, she
                        sounds uncharacteristically weak, hesitant, and apologetic here. In fact,
                        she was more concerned that women should learn than that they should vote,
                        and she was more eager to see them increase their power in the family than
                        in the state. She was wiser than she could have known, for the equality she
                        cared about turns out to be the equality that matters, and the right to vote
                        has not been the answer that women hoped it would be. <figure>

                        </figure> The <hi rend="i">Vindication</hi> remains readable because
                        Wollstone-craft saw the problem so clearly; she recognized that political
                        inequality oppressed women less than the belief in what she called
                        "sexual virtues" (p. 139)—qualities, like delicacy or
                        courage, that are considered merits in one sex but faults in the other.
                        Virginia Woolf’s opinion of the Vindication—that its
                        "originality has become our commonplace" (The Second Common
                        Reader, pp. 143-44)—is probably wrong. The work retains the freshness
                        of an active mind’s enthusiastic encounter with a brand-new idea; the
                        chance to say something truly original freed Wollstonecraft from
                        sensibility, at least temporarily.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="i">Vindication</hi> is worth reading, and this new edition is
                        welcome. Miriam Brody Kramnick provides a helpful introduction that places
                        Wollstonecraft’s achievement in its various historical contexts; the
                        notes, by contrast, are only adequate. Gary Kelly, editing the two pieces of
                        fiction for the Oxford English Novels, supplies the full and enlightening
                        notes we have come to expect from that series, and his introduction makes
                        the best possible case for both works. Without minimizing their limitations,
                        he sees what Wollstonecraft’s intentions probably were and suggests
                        that the stories have a coherency of purpose, whatever they lack in
                        execution. The editor of <hi rend="i">Godwin &amp; Mary</hi>, Ralph M.
                        Wardle, published a biography of Wollstonecraft in 1951. His beautifully
                        meticulous handling of the letters transforms these fragmentary materials
                        into a satisfying, readable whole; there is an excellent, brief introductory
                        essay as well as full and enlightening notes and even a fine index. The
                        Scandinavian <pb id="p12-63" n="63"/> letters are not so well edited. Carol
                        H. Poston’s introduction exaggerates the merits of the letters
                        themselves, and her notes are more often gratuitous than useful. She
                        includes a map of the itinerary but makes no further effort to sort out the
                        jumble that Wollstonecraft’s topographical and chronological
                        vagueness creates. While the book is nicely illustrated with engravings that
                        were not in the original edition, these are not identified.</p>
                    <p>Wollstonecraft’s life was eventful enough to be interesting if she had
                        written nothing. She rescued—or kidnapped—her sister from the
                        sister’s husband, leaving behind a five-month-old baby that died
                        within the year. She traveled alone across winter seas to Lisbon to be with
                        her friend Fanny Blood at the childbed that turned into a deathbed, then
                        sailed back to London in worse weather, compelling the captain to rescue the
                        crew from a foundering French ship. She fell in love with the painter Henry
                        Fuseli but was turned down when she tried to persuade his wife to let her
                        live with them, so she went to France in December 1792, in time for the
                        King’s trial and execution, and stayed on through the Terror, an
                        enemy alien but Imlay’s mistress finally returning to London in April
                        1795. She struggled from the age of eighteen on to support, at different
                        times, her two sisters, her younger brothers, Fanny Blood, and
                        Fanny’s family; her eldest brother, a lawyer who had inherited
                        property from their grandfather, did almost nothing for any of them. At
                        twenty-five she started a girls’ school in which she, her sisters.
                        and Fanny worked, and when it failed, she went to Ireland as a governess in
                        an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family, before she fianlly settled in London,
                        writing, reviewing, and translating. She did not always live by the
                        principles of sense, discipline, and duty that she laid down in the <hi rend="i">Vindication</hi>; her two attempts to kill herself when she had
                        a baby who was dependent on her violated the rules that she said women
                        should live by if they were to act like rational creatures.</p>
                    <p>Claire Tomalin had a good story to tell, and she tells it sympathetically but
                        critically in <hi rend="i">The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft.</hi>
                        It has been told before—several times quite recently—but this
                        life is the most comprehensive. Tomalin tells us a great deal about the
                        people who surrounded Wollstonecraft in England and France, fills in the
                        political and social background fully and vividly, and discusses
                        Wollstonecraft’s influence after her death. This breadth allows
                        Tomalin to give convincing factual explanations of Wollstonecraft’s
                        actions and feelings, and to avoid psychologizing. Tomalin seems to tell all
                        that can be known about Wollstonecraft’s life. There is one issue
                        that Tomalin does not discuss, however: the suggestion made by Robert R.
                        Hare that Wollstonecraft and not Imlay wrote the two books published as
                            his.<ref target="n64" type="note">1</ref> If the works were actually
                        hers or collaborations between her and Imlay, that would not only affect the
                        chronology of their relation but also alter our view of both of them, making
                        him a still less significant character and her the author of a third novel
                        and a successful travel book. Hare’s arguments deserve to be
                        answered, and Tomalin’s opinion would be worth having. <note id="n64">
                            <hi rend="s">1</hi> Hare presented his case at length in "The
                            Base Indian: A Vindication of the Rights of Mary Wollstonecraft"
                            (M.A. theses Univ. of Delaware 1957), and later summarized his arguments
                            in the introduction to his facsimile edition of the novel, <hi rend="i">The Emigrants</hi>, which he published with both

                    <p>Wollstonecraft was thirty-eight when she died. Tomalin makes us feel the loss
                        of this woman who was important not simply as the mother of feminism or of
                        Mary Shelley but also as a writer, thinker, and observer. She was, after
                        all, the friend as well as the wife of William Godwin; she had been
                        encouraged and helped by Dr. Richard Price, the Dissenting minister whose
                        sermon on the French Revolution provoked Burke to begin his <hi rend="i">Reflections</hi>; she was the protegée of Joseph Johnson, the
                        Radical publisher, who got Blake to illustrate two of her works; she was
                        read by Blake and Southey, and her conversation impressed Coleridge and
                        Lamb. She achieved a great deal in a working life that was shortened at one
                        end by poverty and lack of education as well as at the other by early death.
                        She was prevented from achieving more by her sex, which limited her activity
                        to writing although her real talents were probably for some other
                        field—politics, education, medicine—then closed to her. Yet
                        she managed to write a book that was nearly two hundred years ahead of its
                        time; not many men or women without her weaknesses or disadvantages have
                        done that much.

                    <p>This book grew out of David Bindman’s 1971 doctoral dissertation at
                        the Courtauld Institute. Its aim is to take "an analytical view of
                        Blake’s art with particular emphasis upon its relationship to English
                        art of his own time" (p. 9). Blake’s achievement is broadly
                        enough conceived to include all the illuminated books as well as
                        Blake’s paintings and engravings in all media, including the
                        illustrations of the Bible, Milton, Bunyon, Gray, Young, and others. The
                        "seemingly more conventional designs" (p. 9)—that is, those
                        that do not accompany Blake’s own words—Bindman properly sees
                        as an end in themselves to which the decorated poetry contributes meanings
                        and motifs. Most literary scholars have it the other way round, making what
                        Frye once called the canonical works the center of their attention; but
                        Bindman does not see these as "self-contained" (p. 9). Following
                        in the footsteps of his teachers, Blunt and Butlin, he uses, for the most
                        part, the methods of an art historian, analyzing the visual elements of
                        Blake’s <hi rend="i">oeuvre</hi> and their relation to contemporary
                        and antecedent art. He defines his <pb id="p12-65" n="65"/> task in such a
                        way as to require more attention to Blake’s artistic friends and
                        contemporaries than to the grand examples of Dürer, Raphael,
                        Michelangelo, and the Mannerists. Even so, Bindman does not give a
                        sufficiently detailed account of Blake’s relations to Fuseli,
                        Flaxman, Banks, Romney, West, Barry, Mortimer, all of whom are mentioned and
                        some of whom are discussed with penetration. One would have to say that the
                        iconographical and stylistic relations of Blake to English art need still to
                        be studied, since Bindman subordinates this important scholarly task to his
                        chronological plan of analyzing each important work of Blake as it appeared,
                        concentrating on its meaning and value. The author has thus given us not so
                        much a new work of intellectual synthesis or of scholarship as another
                        introduction to Blake’s chief works with incidental comments on their
                        personal and traditional contexts.</p>
                    <p>What point of view about Blake’s ultimate place in art history
                        prevails? Boldly but disarmingly, Bindman derives his perspective from none
                        other than Reynolds, whose characterization of the "original or
                        characteristical style" he applies to Blake (pp. 9-10). That style the
                        president of the Royal Academy had regarded as inferior to the grand style
                        though it was produced by men "of lively and vigorous
                        imagination," but he found it valuable because it reveals internal
                        coherence and harmony even when irregular, wild, and incorrect. It can be
                        admired as the faithful picture of a mind, and it commands attention for its
                        consistency even though it does not rise to elevation. This use of Reynolds
                        at the very beginning of the book is, in its way, refreshing; it seems to
                        give Bindman his perspective, leading him into commentary that is central
                        and commonsensical. He honors his subject and is capable of enthusiastic
                        appreciation, but one never has the feeling that Bindman confuses Blake with
                        Michelangelo or Rembrandt.</p>
                    <p>Since this book confronts all of Blake’s visual and visual-verbal
                        works, the literary scholar will be curious to know how well the
                        "readings" come off. Very well indeed, in my view. The mastery of
                        modern scholarship is impressive, the knowledge of Blake’s visual and
                        literary contexts exemplary. The criticism of particular works is the more
                        effective for being organized and for being related to developing topics
                        that run all through the study. Sometimes, to be sure, Bindman, like so many
                        of us, runs to mere description; but it is gratifying to notice that more
                        often than not the elements treated are properly subordinated in an analysis
                        and that a real effort has been made to arrive at interpretation. The
                        readings are "prophetic"—that is, Bindman knows and uses
                        Blake’s myth and is therefore not content with surface meanings or
                        traditional iconographic interpretation. In discussing, for example, the
                        colorprint of 1795 entitled <hi rend="i">Pity</hi>, Bindman sees it, along
                        with its companion <hi rend="i">Hecate</hi>, as an expression of the Female
                        Will. The child is Orc, the son of Enitharmon, who lies prone on the ground.
                        In the same series, the <hi rend="i">Good and Evil Angels</hi> is seen as a
                        continuation of the story of Orc in which a jealous Los (and here there is a
                        recollection of his role in <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi>) reaches
                        out to restrain the revolutionary boy (p. 99).</p>
                    <p>Most "readings" are similarly "prophetic," and Bindman is
                        a good guide to the essential meanings of both word and figure. But one does
                        have reservations, and some of these are important enough to divulge.
                        Although the description of the Vales of Har in <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi>
                        (pp. 44-46)—and that particular spot of Blakean spiritual geography I
                        myself find to be of the highest importance—is very good, one is
                        tempted to ask, Where is the horror? The horror, that is, of a mature woman
                        and a white-bearded man sleeping together like infants and, awake, panting
                        out puerilities. Bindman’s description of these Vales as being
                        "lyrical" or as being a prefiguration of Beulah obscures their
                        qualities of regression and arrested development. Other commentary reveals
                        the same critical fault: it is sound and central but not sufficiently
                        emphatic and so, through excessive caution, dissipates some of
                        Blake’s power of expression and blunts his often dismaying
                        originality. The analysis of <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> contains one
                        serious confusion. Can Thel be said to confront Experience when she
                        encounters the Lily, the Cloud, the Worm, and the Clod of Clay, all of whom
                        are surely denizens of Blake’s Innocence, enjoying its uninhibited
                        freedom and displaying its love and charity with unselfconscious ease? The
                        world of Experience seems to me to be confined to the last plate; it is from
                        that vision of social and psychological perversion which Thel flees at the
                        end, not from the joyous portrayal of natural life.</p>
                    <p>Rather than pausing to note such qualifications as these all the way through
                        the book, perhaps it would be wise to concentrate on the interpretation of
                        one important illuminated work. In commenting on <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>
                        (pp. 79 ff), that beautiful, resonant, and complex Lambeth prophecy, Bindman
                        perceives why the incarnation of Christ is so important at this historical
                        moment, why Urizen appears on the frontispiece, why the title-page serpent
                        is so energetic (though something should have been said on how it is related
                        to the similar serpent on plate 10 and to the whole matter of revolutionary
                        versus counter-revolutionary serpents), why the inquiring man is
                        Blake’s Mental Traveller, why Enitharmon holds the veil over the
                        sleeping youth (she is covering and not unveiling him), and why the
                        spiderweb is the net of religion (is it not, however, woven primarily by
                        Urizen and not by Albion’s Angels?). And yet, good though it is, the
                        commentary does not confront the truly difficult cruxes. What is the meaning
                        of the nameless shadowy female, who brandishes her snaky hair? Why does
                        Newton blow the trumpet? Blake evidently perceived that when revolutionary
                        forces are unleashed a fecund nature will utter uninhibited and chaotic
                        cries against all order, even the artistic. He also saw that the possessor
                        of a great genius that had been perverted to mischievous cultural and
                        intellectual ends might well fill the cup of iniquity to overflowing and so
                        precipitate both revolution and counter-revolution.</p>
                    <p>The analyses of the purely visual works are usually excellent. Bindman sees
                        the prophetic potential in Blake’s early "neo-classical"
                        works (observe his perceptive comment on the significance of Joseph in
                        Egypt, pp. 34-35). Very often he adduces original materials which help
                        interpret the works in question; and he alerts us to what is <pb id="p12-66" n="66"/> often neglected or may surprise us, Blake’s admiration
                        of Claude (p. 203) or a possible recollection of Rembrandt (p. 126). But
                        even in the area of the purely visual, where Bindman is more thoroughly
                        trained than most Blake commentators, we find that his plan of covering
                        everything forces him to be excessively brief and general at crucial
                        moments. For example, although he is fully aware of the superiority of the
                        Boston <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> illustrations to those in the
                        Huntington, he misses an opportunity to show in precise detail the
                        superiority of one version of Adam, Eve, and Raphael over the other (pp.
                        190-191 and plates 152, 153). In the Huntington version the profiles of Adam
                        and Eve are simply drawn and as expressions are undifferentiated. In the
                        Boston version the facial lineaments of our first parents are subtly drawn
                        and express profound meaning: Adam seems to be confused and disturbed by
                        what he hears and Eve responds delicately, wonderingly and submissively to
                        his confusion. The bodies of the first pair are also more powerfully
                        modeled, and the angel looks less like a worried human being and more like a
                        royal, though slightly surprised, heavenly monitor. The centrality of
                        Eve’s standing position in a later version not only provides the
                        beautiful female form at the focus of our attention, not only shows her
                        separated from Adam, but may also point to her central role in the Fall and
                        perhaps even ultimately in the redemption of man. Blake was certainly not
                        the master of facial expression that the very greatest portrait artists
                        were; but faces and particularly eyes are extremely important, as the
                        superiority of the Boston version of <hi rend="i">Comus</hi> over the
                        Huntington also expresses. Bindman is extremely good in showing the <hi rend="i">formal</hi> superiority of the later version of <hi rend="i">Comus and his Revellers</hi>, for example (p. 186 and plates 146, 147),
                        but he says nothing of the greater richness and humanity of the Boston lady
                        over the rather flat, simple, one-dimensional San Marino virgin. Similarly,
                        on page 115, in an otherwise excellent analysis of a watercolor entitled <hi rend="i">Malevolence</hi>, Bindman seems to miss the importance of the
                        youthful father’s gaze, which is directed at Malevolence (plate 96),
                        showing that the hideous psychological states portrayed can be seen as being
                            <hi rend="i">caused</hi> by merit ("He hath a daily beauty in his
                        life that makes mine ugly"). In the same painting the father’s
                        calm gaze is returned by the two fiends, each staring back in his own malign
                        way while the wife and child fix their gazes upon the father. In fact, one
                        of the most striking features of this powerful work are the lines of force
                        and meaning that are generated by the eye-contacts of five people.
                        Surprisingly, such matters are usually met with silence by Bindman, who
                        apparently is not often impressed with the importance in Blake of eyes and
                        glances.</p>
                    <p>To turn to an important matter involving Blake’s artistic background,
                        one wishes that Bindman had been a little bit fuller on the influence of
                        Raphael. It is not that he neglects the prince of painters or that he would
                        not acknowledge that Raphael is one of Blake’s culture heores. It is
                        rather that his several references are not pulled together into a coherent
                        whole, and we are therefore not allowed to see what is one of the most
                        powerful, consistent, and uninterrupted influences upon Blake by any
                        antecedent painter. I shall not repeat the case I made for Raphael’s
                        influence in <hi rend="i">William Blake Poet and Painter</hi> (pp. 41-43 and
                        plates XIXA, XIXB, XX, XXI). Here I would only like to disagree with
                        Bindman’s finding that in <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> it is
                        Michelangelo’s God the Father in the Sistine Chapel who chiefly
                        presides over Blake’s imagination (pp. 89-95). I find, instead, that
                        it is the God of Raphael’s Bible, as engraved by some of his
                        followers, whose body, hand-positions, and activities are precise
                        anticipations of Blake’s creator-god. I do not wish to deny that
                        Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel may indeed be present in Blake’s
                        imagination (they almost always are), but I wish to suggest that, in terms
                        of context, the Genesis of Blake’s Bible of Hell is a direct and
                        forceful inversion of Raphael.</p>
                    <p>I have praised the centrality and soundness of Bindman’s commentary.
                        That praise is meant to embrace his perception of what is revolutionary and
                        revisionist in Blake’s religion. More than once Bindman reveals that
                        he is aware that his subject possessed a radical, inquiring, restless mind,
                        not content to dwell comfortably in the house of conventional platitude,
                        however beautiful. Nevertheless, all the way through the book the author
                        displays a tendency to use Christian and Neoplatonic truisms to describe
                        Blake’s essential vision, often omitting the specific details, the
                        alterations of convention, even the subversions of meaning that give it
                        originality, force, and revolutionary energy. A few examples will show the
                        "piety" that tends to prevail and that appears in language which
                        is too close to Blake’s own phrasing to be illuminating and which can
                        obscure Blake’s radical originality. Thus the designs and texts of
                            <hi rend="i">The Songs of Innocence</hi> are said to pertain primarily
                        to the idea of man’s salvation (p. 62). The caves that entrap Oothoon
                        are "materialistic" (p. 74). The cage that imprisons the soul is
                        the body in the lovely early poem, "How Sweet I Roam’d" (p.
                        86). Albion’s dance is a paradigm of "regeneration," which
                        is here called "the true religious ecstasy" (p. 97). A lonely
                        woman in the moonlight of one of the Young illustrations (p. 112) is
                        "the soul seeking the aid of truth"—an "ineffable
                        resonance" (p. 112). And Paul’s posture in <hi rend="i">St. Paul
                            Preaching at Athens</hi> suggests the "timeless operation of the
                        spirit" (p. 138). But if we look more closely at these
                        examples—and several others might have been chosen—we see that
                        Bindman has caught Blake’s meaning in a conventional net and that the
                        complex, troubled emotion of the original has been rendered somewhat
                        complacent by the commentary. The rigidity of Paul’s form and
                        position, the excessive symmetry of the composition, the expression on his
                        face, and his relation to the light make the Apostle at best an ambiguous
                        figure. One wonders if the young female asking the way of two nightwatchmen
                        by moonlight may not be a young woman like Lyca of <hi rend="i">Innocence
                            and Experience</hi>, encountering a young man and an old man in the
                        deserts of sexuality, rather than the soul ineffably seeking the truth.
                        Albion’s dance, by Blake’s own word, is the "dance of
                        Eternal Death": can it therefore be called a "key image of
                        Regeneration" (p. 97)? The cage is more often that of love and marriage
                        in Blake than of the body, and the lovely words of "How Sweet I
                        Roam’d" are more erotic than Neoplatonic. Oothoon’s <pb id="p12-67" n="67"/> cave is rather marital and sexual than
                        materialistic. And Christ is present in <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> more as
                        a sanctioner of sexual joy and uninhibited play than of other-worldly
                        salvation. Bindman may be a little too determined to see divine light in
                        Blake, a light which he usually interprets as supernatural. But, as Blake
                        said in concluding <hi rend="i">The Auguries of Innocence</hi>, God is light
                        primarily to those who dwell in unvisionary night but displays a human form
                        to those who live in realms of prophetic daylight.</p>
                    <p>It should perhaps be noted that something has rather frequently gone wrong
                        with references to the plates. I have noted the following mistakes: plate 39
                        on page 55, pl. 60 on p. 78, pl. 85 on p. 99, pl. 124 on p. 164, pl. 140 on
                        p. 178, pl. 165 on p. 204, pl. 169 on p. 210. In each of these instances,
                        the number refers to a work other than the one that appears on the
                        designated plate. In some cases the proper work appears elsewhere in this
                        volume, on another plate; occasionally it does not appear at all.</p>
                    <p>I do not wish to end negatively. Bindman’s book is an example of good
                        scholarship and trained, intelligent perceptions.</p>

                    <p>An article about William Blake which was one of the most widely circulated
                        American accounts of his life and works in the later pre-Gilchrist years and
                        for at least a decade thereafter should be added to the extensive

                        was undertaken only when the entire project was in "an advanced state

                    </p>
                    <p>The article, about 550 words long, seems to depend almost entirely upon
                        Cunningham’s <hi rend="i">Lives</hi> for biographical and
                        bibliographical information as well as for a judgment of Blake and his
                        works; in fact, numerous parallels (for example, 1828 as the date of
                        Blake’s death) make it plain that Cunningham is quoted silently,
                        repeatedly, and often pretty carelessly. Several of Blake’s works are
                        mentioned specifically, and, after Cunningham, the "inventions for the
                        Book of Job" are judged "his best production." Likewise,
                        Blake’s visionary qualities are emphasized: <q> He wrote songs,
                            composed music, and painted at the same time; but in the excitement of
                            his labors, he began to conceive that he was under spiritual influences;
                            and as external prosperity was wanting, he grew more and more abstracted
                            and retired, until the visionary tendencies of his nature dominated his
                            life. Among his friends he gave out that the works on which he was
                            engaged were copied from great works revealed to him, and that his
                            lessons in art were given him by celestial tongues. An original and
                            beautiful method of engraving and tinting his plates he ascribed to the
                            dead brother of his wife, Robert. </q> The error in the last sentence
                        suggests a careless reading of Cunningham, as do the statements that <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> contains a "drama" (Cunningham
                        says "a dramatic poem") and that Blake made "12
                        ‘Inventions’" for the "Canterbury Pilgrims."
                        Curiously, however, the article states correctly a few details not included
                        in Cunningham’s <hi rend="i">Lives</hi>: 1789 is given as the date of
                        the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, and the "Canterbury Pilgrims"
                        (correctly named in contrast to Cunningham’s "Canterbury
                        Pilgrimage") is described as a "water-color painting" whereas
                        Cunningham simply mentions that it was painted. Possibly the article-writer
                        was familiar with Robert Balmanno’s copy of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>, which gives "1789" clearly on the title page;
                        that this same copy, <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (U), had bound with it a
                        print from Blake’s engraving of the "Canterbury Pilgrims"
                        may also explain why the article-writer gives a correct version of
                        Blake’s title, although the accurate observation that Blake’s
                        larger version was a "water-color painting," or at least not an
                        oil, remains of mysterious origin.<ref target="n67" type="note">3</ref>

                        Dana and George Ripley, the newspaper’s literary critic, were the two
                        editors of the <hi rend="i">New American Cyclopedia</hi> (whose list of
                        contributors does not include anyone else known to have had an early

                    <p>Although Dana’s contribution to Blake’s fame occurred late in
                        the pre-Gilchrist years, his two publications mentioned here are especially
                        important to Blake’s American reputation because they were widely
                        read and respected. Dana judged the <hi rend="i">Household Book of
                            Poetry</hi> to include "within the bounds of a single volume
                        whatever is truly beautiful and admirable among the minor poems of the

                        American public seems to have enthusiastically supported his critical
                        judgments, for the anthology (with the addition of yet another of
                        Blake’s <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> in the 1858 and subsequent

                        printings in the nineteenth century and four more in the twentieth.
                        Dana’s biographer seems correct in describing the <hi rend="i">New

                    <p>Blake’s "Night" from <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> appeared in
                        the <hi rend="i">New Church Advocate</hi> for 16 May 1843 (1, no. 26, 208).
                        I should have noticed this printing in preparing my article, "New Light
                        on C. A. Tulk, Blake’s Nineteenth-Century Patron" (<hi rend="i">Studies in Romanticism</hi>, 16 [1977], 217-36), which included
                        discussion of Tulk’s responsibility for the insertion of
                        Blake’s "The Divine Image" in the <hi rend="i">New Church
                            Advocate</hi> for 1 December 1844. My arguments about Tulk’s role
                        in the publication of "The Divine Image" apply equally about the
                        probability that he was responsible for the insertion of Blake’s
                        "Night" more than a year earlier. The text of Blake’s
                        "Night" in the <hi rend="i">New Church Advocate</hi> is followed
                        by the citation, "<hi rend="i">Blake’s Songs of
                        Innocence</hi>" and, most notably, differs in more than a half dozen
                        particulars of punctuation and spelling from that given by J. J. Garth
                        Wilkinson in his 1839 edition of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, thus
                        suggesting that the text of Blake’s "Night" was provided by
                        someone who, like Tulk, had access to one of Blake’s original
                        copies.</p>

                    <p>Professor William S. Ward has generously drawn my attention to a previously
                        unrecorded reference to Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> in the obscure
                        and short-lived satirical political weekly <hi rend="i">The Star
                            Chamber</hi> for Wednesday 3 May 1826: <q> Mr. William Blake, whose
                            illustrations in outline of Young, Gray, and other poets have long been
                            before the public, has completed his designs for the Book of Job. Some
                            of the etchings are full of that remarkable wildness and singularity of
                            conception, for which Blake is so well known. The embodying of the
                            plagues inflicted on Job by the Almighty; the personification of a
                            Night-mare, and the figures of the creation,<ref target="n72" type="note">1</ref> are wonderful, although we do not think them
                            equal either in point of originality or skilful execution to some of the
                            earlier productions of this extraordinary artist.<ref target="n73" type="note">2</ref>

                    </p>
                    <p>The account is interesting for a number of reasons. For one thing, it
                        displays a surprising knowledge of Blake’s works. The
                        "illustrations in outline of Young" refer of course to
                        Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> (1797) with forty-three
                        plates designed and engraved by Blake. The "Gray" outlines can
                        scarcely refer to the series of watercolors Blake made in 1797-98 for
                        Flaxman in illustration of Gray’s poems, for these were not
                        "before the public" in 1826 (they were first published in 1922);
                        "Gray" is probably a mistake for <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> by
                        Robert Blair with twelve designs by Blake etched by Schiavonetti published
                        in 1808 and 1813, for this was Blake’s best-known work. The
                        "earlier productions of this extraordinary artist" seems to refer
                        to Blake’s works in Illuminated Printing, and since very few copies
                        were printed they were known only to few. The <hi rend="i">Star Chamber</hi>
                        author seems to have been surprisingly well informed about Blake’s
                        works.</p>
                    <p>He is also strikingly up-to-date in his information about the publication of
                            <hi rend="i">Job.</hi> Subscriptions for it had been taken since 1823
                            (<hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> [1969], 598), but the label is dated
                        "March 1826," and the first completed copies were distributed at
                        the end of that month (<hi rend="i">ibid</hi>, p. 327). It was not, however,
                        published in the ordinary way, apparently no review-copies were sent to
                        journals, and no review of it is known. Indeed, not only is the <hi rend="i">Star Chamber</hi> paragraph the first known published reference to the
                        publication of <hi rend="i">Job</hi>, but it seems to be the only such
                        reference during Blake’s lifetime. Even the obituaries of Blake
                        failed to mention <hi rend="i">Job</hi> except for that in <hi rend="i">The
                            Literary Gazette</hi> (1 November 1827), and the only other account
                        before 1830 was in J. T. Smith’s life of Blake (1828). The <hi rend="i">Star Chamber</hi> account is important, therefore, as the only
                        printed reference during Blake’s lifetime to the publication of his
                        greatest finished series of line-engravings.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">The Star Chamber</hi> is a jocular sixteen-page weekly published
                        by W. Marsh which began on 19 April 1826 and ended with No. 9 on Wednesday 7
                        June 1826. It includes reviews, attacks on politicians, "The Dunciad of
                        To-day," and news of the arts, particularly exhibitions; it is in the
                        untitled art section that the Blake reference comes. The periodical seems to
                        have been founded by Peter Hall (who gave a copy to Bodley) with various
                        assistants. Benjamin Disraeli was accused of having been the first editor,
                        but he expressly denied this in <hi rend="i">The Times</hi> for 3 November
                        1871 and <hi rend="i">Leisure Hours</hi> for 4 November 1871.<ref target="n74" type="note">3</ref> However, his authorized biographer
                        concedes that Disraeli did contribute some fables called "The Modern
                        AEsop," a review, "and perhaps other matter,"<hi rend="s">3</hi> and it is not unlikely that he was responsible directly or
                        indirectly for the notice of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job.</hi> At any
                        rate, he was peculiarly well situated to know of Blake’s more
                        "original" and "skilful" "earlier
                        productions," for his father Isaac (d. 1848) owned <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> (F), <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> (F), <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (D), <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (B), <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (A), <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (A), and <hi rend="i">Song of
                            Los</hi>, and these works of course later came into Benjamin
                        Disraeli’s hands. And we know that Benjamin himself was interested in
                        Blake, for he tried to get The British Museum to buy Blake’s 537
                        watercolor designs to Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> in
                            1875,<ref target="n75" type="note">4</ref> over fifty years before they
                        eventually reached the Museum. It is at least a plausible guess that
                        Benjamin Disraeli is the <pb id="p12-70" n="70"/> author of the only

                    <p>The most extensive series of illustrations Blake is known to have made was
                        for Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>—537 large water
                        colors preparatory for the Richard Edwards edition of 1797. When that
                        publication proved to be an incubator baby, requiring peace and seclusion
                        from the world for over a century before reaching full growth in public
                        esteem and commercial price, the drawings too were largely forgotten. They
                        passed from Richard Edwards to his brother Thomas, who offered them at
                        £52.10.0 in 1826 and 1828,<ref target="n76" type="note">1</ref> but even
                        praise comparing them favorably with the work of Michael Angelo could not
                        lure a collector to venture so large a sum.<ref target="n76" type="note">1</ref> They therefore retreated into the bosom of the Edwards family,
                        and their whereabouts was almost completely unknown for some fifty years. In
                        his <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake, "Pictor Ignotus"</hi>
                        (1863) which revived Blake’s flickering fame, Alexander Gilchrist
                        supposed erroneously that the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> drawings had
                        gone to "one of the royal collections" (Vol. I, p. 140). A few new
                        facts have recently turned up which throw light on the history of the
                        drawings in the 1870s. <note id="n76">

                    </p>
                    <p>About a decade later, the interest in Blake which Gilchrist’s book had
                        aroused fostered the emergence of the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>
                        drawings again, and by the above passage in Gilchrist one reader wrote: <q>
                            No, I saw these drawings, over 500 in number, at [<hi rend="i">the
                                bookdealer</hi>] Rimell’s in Oxford Street, in May 1874. They

                        James was one of the chief antiquarian booksellers of the time. On 18 June
                        1874 she wrote that she went <q> To the Haymarket [<hi rend="i">where the
                                Bain shop was located</hi>] and looked at the two volumes of

                            illustrations by William Blake, which James has lately met with [<hi rend="i">?at Rimell’s</hi>], and thinks himself extremely
                            fortunate to have secured at the price of £425. He considers it a
                            perfect treasure, and people who are considered judges flock to see it,
                            and speak highly of it. I do not like it, but then I am no judge of its
                                merits.<ref target="n78" type="note">3</ref>

                        </q> A year later, on 13 June 1875, she wrote again: <q> James has spoke of
                            his <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> to Mr. Disraeli who advises his writing to
                            the British Museum authorities, and allows him to use his name, which we
                            hope will have great weight, both as Prime Minister and also as a member
                            of the British Museum Committee. James has written accordingly and they
                            have sent for the book, which is there now to be inspected. [<hi rend="i">P. 75</hi>] </q> They had another reason to think that
                        Disraeli’s opinion might bear some weight, for he had inherited from
                        his father one of the most notable early collections of Blake’s books
                        and therefore was in a good position to judge Blake’s merits.
                        However, what Disraeli did was fairly minimal. The bookseller wrote to the
                        British Museum: <q> James Bain<lb/> 1 Haymarket<lb/> London (SW)<lb/>

                            7th June 1875<lb/> Sir<lb/> I am desired by Mr. Disraeli to bring under
                            your notice some original drawings by William Blake now in my
                            possession.<lb/>
                            <lb/> The designs illustrate Young’s Night

                            <lb/> They form the most extensive series of designs done by
                            this Artist and tho’ unknown to his later biographers may be
                            regarded as the ‘great work’ of his life. As such it seems
                            desirable that they should find an appropriate place in the National

                            the drawings referred to to the notice of the authorities of the British
                            Museum Mr. Disraeli advised him that the best course would be to write
                            to you on the subject and gave him authority to make use of his name in
                            the matter.<lb/>

                        <pb id="p12-71" n="71"/> The discrepancy between James Bain’s
                        expectations and Disraeli’s performance is striking, and one does not
                        know whether to admire more the slipperiness of the politician or the
                        discretion of the statesman, struggling to avoid appearing as both advocate
                        and judge in the same cause.</p>
                    <p>On receipt of this letter, the Museum authorities sought the opinion of
                        George William Reid, the Keeper of the Print Room (1866-83), and he replied
                        on the same day: <q> Department of Prints and Drawings<lb/> June 9th.
                            1875<lb/>
                            <lb/> Mr. Reid has the honour to report to the Trustees he has
                            carefully examined the 2 volumes of Blake’s designs offered to
                            the Trustees for the sum of £2,000 [<hi rend="i">or about £3.
                                15. 0 each</hi>], and finds the series very interesting but somewhat
                            dear.<lb/>
                            <lb/> The 2 volumes offered by Mr. Bain, if the purchase were
                            entertained, could only be acquired by the aid of a special grant, which
                            Mr. Reid has ascertained by Mr. Montagu Corry [<hi rend="i">a treasury
                                official</hi>] to be quite out of the question at the present
                            moment.<lb/>

                                presumably have come, at least indirectly, from the First Lord of

                    <p>This reply was of course decisive, and the Minutes of the British Museum
                        Standing Committee for 12 June 1875 (pp. 13292-93) record: <q> Read a letter
                            from Mr. James Bain, dated the 7th of June, offering, for £2,000,
                            William Blake’s original drawings, in two volumes, in
                            illustration of Young’s Night Thoughts; also a letter from one of
                            the Secretaries of the First Lord of the Treasury, and a report from Mr.
                            Reid, both dated the 9th of June.<lb/>
                            <lb/> Resolved, that Mr.
                            Bain’s offer be declined. </q> The conclusion was forwarded to
                        James Bain, whose niece wrote in her Journal for 17 June: "The British
                        Museum declines to take the <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>; I am so sorry" (p.
                        75).</p>
                    <p>Scholars of Blake and lovers of art had cause to be sorry too, for the
                        drawings remained in private hands for another fifty years. In the Bain
                        family, "the book was looked upon as a white elephant for twenty years
                        or more" until it was sold for £1,500 to Marsden J. Parry (p. 187),
                        from whom it passed to W. A. White a few years later, and the first partial
                        publication and exhibition of the drawings were in 1927. Somewhat
                        ironically, they returned to The British Museum Print Room by the munificent
                        gift of W. A. White’s daughter Frances White Emerson in 1929. Had
                        they entered The British Museum Print Room in 1875, they might not still be
                        largely unreproduced<ref target="n82" type="note">7</ref> and little known.

                        theory at the University of New Mexico. He is writing a book on the defense
                        of poetry in modern criticism, excerpts from which are appearing in <hi rend="i">Centennial Review</hi> and <hi rend="i">Southern Humanities

                    <p>Subscription prices for <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> have been raised
                        considerably, as you will have no doubt noticed. The following explanation
                        and apology was mailed with this year’s bills:</p>
                    <p>Dear Subscriber</p>
                    <p>With your annual bill for another year’s subscription to <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, we would like to offer an apology for contributing to the
                        increases in your cost of living.</p>
                    <p>You will notice that the price of a subscription has increased to $10 for
                        individuals, $12 for institutions. We <hi rend="i">hope</hi> you havealso
                        noticed that the number of pages in an average issue of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> has increased proportionately during the past year. Our
                        issues have been running about 80 pages. When we were the <hi rend="i">Blake
                            Newsletter</hi> issues averaged 24-44 pages. We hope you have also
                        noticed that <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> gets a <hi rend="i">lot</hi> of text on
                        a single page, much more than the average 6 × 9 scholarly journal
                        that prints 1 column per page. And finally, we don’t think you could
                        have missed the illustrations, which are very expensive to print, but which
                        we think make <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> especially useful to you as a
                        scholar.</p>
                    <p>We would also like to assure you that we take every economy to keep the cost
                        of our issues as low as possible. <hi rend="i">All</hi> the layout and
                        pasteup of our journal is done by unpaid volunteer editorial assistants, for
                        example. That is extremely unusual for a scholarly journal, if not unique.
                        If that work were turned over to professionals, the cost of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> would soar.</p>
                    <p>And, despite the economies, despite the increase in your subscription price,
                        the cost of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> is still heavily subsidized by the
                        University of New Mexico. The subsidy has, in fact, just been increased.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we hope that you will take a moment to consider that the fat issues
                        of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> are costing you only about $2.50 each—even
                        at the $10 per year price.</p>
                    <p>Thank you in advance for your patience. Yours truly, The Editors.</p>

                    <p>The fall issue, #46, will feature a number of essays on Blake’s <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi>, including a series on the editorial problem of
                        the "two" Nights Seven, a pair of articles on the text of Night I,
                        and interpretive articles on the influence of the Cabbala, on
                        "atmospheres", and on the spectrous embrace in Night VII. In
                        addition to the material on <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, there will be

                    <p>We received the following letter from Erica Doctorow and Donald Wolf and
                        solicited the reply from Ruth E. Fine that follows it in turn:</p>
                    <p>To the Editors: 1 June 1978<lb/> This may seem like a tardy reply to Ruth
                        Fine’s review (<hi rend="i">Blake 42</hi>, fall 1977) of the Blake
                        exhibition at Adelphi University, but the review itself appeared six months
                        after the exhibition closed, and it raises some interesting questions.</p>
                    <p>To begin with, Miss Fine writes that it is a "disservice to late
                        18th-early 19th century England" to suggest that Blake confronted
                        neglect and indifference. Isn’t it an even greater disservice to
                        Blake to imply that he may actually have received the recognition he
                        deserved?</p>
                    <p>Miss Fine’s review also does a disservice to the catalog, a reading of
                        which can hardly justify her remark that it is "more spirited than
                        informative," especially if one keeps in mind that it was intended <pb id="p12-73" n="73"/> to be an introduction to Blake. Miss Fine notes
                        this purpose but recalls it only fitfully.</p>
                    <p>"The crow wish’d every thing was black, the owl that every thing
                        was white." Miss Fine wishes that the exhibition had made a major point
                        of the fact that original prints and drawings are superior to reproductions.
                        At least, that seems to be what she means when she says that it should have
                        demonstrated "the differences in the tactile life of printed surfaces
                        and their effects on one’s responses to works of art." (Her
                        style is definitely not spirited.) Adelphi focused on the content of
                        Blake’s art. Would it not have been a disservice to our students to
                        teach them that they were doomed to inferior esthetic experiences by the
                        unavailability of the original prints, which, as Miss Fine puts it, must
                        remain in repositories like the Alverthorpe Gallery for the sake of
                        "persons"—she seems to mean scholars—"who
                        travel great distances and at great expense in anticipation of viewing
                        particular works"? Apparently she is as content for Blake to belong to
                        the few, not the many, in the present as in the past. As it happens, the
                        exhibition itself contradicted her premise, thanks to the generosity of
                        other institutions and private collectors who lent Adelphi many original
                        works.</p>
                    <p>It is also a disservice to readers of <hi rend="i">Blake, An Illustrated
                            Quarterly</hi> to permit the implication to stand, as Miss Fine does,
                        that she attended any of the events related to the exhibition—in
                        particular, the opera, "Auguries of Innocence," and the dance,
                        "Eternity in an Hour." Since she did not, it does not much matter
                        that she seems to find them praiseworthy. On the other hand, she does not
                        mention that the exhibition opened with a talk on Blake’s methods of
                        printing; but she does criticize Adelphi for giving no attention to the
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>Given a different tone, Miss Fine’s criticisms might be understood as
                        the opposition of true friendship. As it is, our reaction is better
                        suggested by another of Blake’s proverbs: "He whose face gives
                        no light shall never become a star."</p>

                    <p>Ruth E. Fine replies: 27 June 1978<lb/> Ms. Doctorow and Professor Wolf were
                        sent a copy of the Blake exhibition review manuscript, published in the fall
                        1977 issue of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, well in advance of its publication, a
                        gesture to which they never responded; the elliptical implication of the
                        sorrows of time passed with which they open their letter thus leaves a
                        mysterious question as to motivation in writing now.</p>
                    <p>It remains extremely disturbing that the difference between reproductions and
                        original works is a matter of such casual inconsequence to the organizers of
                        a Blake exhibition. This, however, may account for the lack or
                        superficiality of the descriptive material regarding such differences.</p>
                    <p>So far as viewing original material is concerned, Alverthorpe Gallery, as the
                        review accurately stated, is open to "persons"—any person
                        who will write or call and who shows genuine interest in examining the
                        collection. Hundreds do. The inference drawn by Ms. Doctorow and Professor
                        Wolf that access to the collection is restricted to "scholars"
                        (with no suggestion of what standards they would assign to that category) is
                        inaccurate; it is also unscholarly since the truth of the matter could
                        easily have been determined before it was committed to paper.</p>
                    <p>This is only one inaccuracy of several in their defensive response to my
                        review, but it would be tedious beyond decent patience to refute them
                        further.</p>
