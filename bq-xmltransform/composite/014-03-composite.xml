          <p>Blake has, on the whole, been well-served by scholarly anthologies. <hi rend="i">Visionary Forms Dramatic</hi> (ed. David Erdman and John Grant)
                        showed us how to read his pictorial language in harness with his visionary
                        poetry; <hi rend="i">Blake’s Sublime Allegory</hi> (ed. Stuart Curran
                        and Joseph Wittreich) taught us that his major prophecies have a formal and
                        rhetorical integrity to match their intellectual brilliance. Now Donald
                        Pearce and Robert Essick give us <hi rend="i">Blake in His Time</hi> to make
                        clear what should have been obvious all along, that Blake’s work did
                        not spring from nothing, but emerged out of a deeply learned and thoughtful
                        examination of his cultural milieu. In some ways this message does nothing
                        to redeem Blake from his splendid isolation: seeing him in his own time does
                        not necessarily make him more accessible to ours, and nothing will ever
                        remedy the combination of bad luck, intransigence, and indifference which
                        led to Blake’s neglect by all but a handful of his contemporaries.
                        But the other kind of isolation, the kind that T. S. Eliot referred to when
                        he complained of Blake’s "meanness of culture"—this
                        misconception has been decisively eliminated. Most major artists encounter
                        precisely the opposite sort of fortunes in cultural history. Criticism of
                        them begins with the study of influences, and attempts to place them in a
                        network of historical relationships. With Blake this sort of thing has come
                        very late, having to wait, it seems, for the formation of a modern community
                        of scholars and general readers, the fit audience that Blake so fervently
                        desired.</p>
          <p>To judge by this collection of essays the scholarly audience is very fit and
                        in no danger of being few. Some of the essays manage that most difficult of
                        balancing acts, reconstructing the historical context of a work of art while
                        suggesting its renewed importance for our own time. Gerald Bentley’s
                        meticulous reconstruction of the artistic response to <hi rend="i">The Book
                            of Enoch</hi> when it appeared in England in 1821 recovers a tiny but
                        fascinating moment in cultural history (five major artists and poets
                        illustrated or wrote about this apocryphal book when it appeared) at the
                        same time that it makes visible the remarkable inventiveness of
                        Blake’s designs for <hi rend="i">Enoch.</hi> Where Flaxman had
                        translated the Angels who couple with the daughters of men into his
                        predictable classical warriors, and Westall made them winged shepherds in a
                        sentimental pastoral, Blake siezed upon a passage much later in <hi rend="i">The Book of Enoch</hi> (message for illustrators: read the whole book)
                        in which the fallen angels are seen in the shape of "great stars, whose
                        parts of shame resembled those of horses." Blake, as Bentley shows,
                        presents this image pictorially as a pair of Apollonian nudes with starry
                        rays and giant phalluses emanating from their loins. This grotesquely <pb id="p14-117" n="117"/> effective invention (which sounds a bit
                        ridiculous, but is quite powerful in visual form) exemplifies Blake’s
                        rare gift as an illustrator, his ability to express something independent
                        of, almost in spite of his text (in this case, an affirmation of the
                        eroticism which is condemned by Enoch), and to do so not by violating the
                        text, but by imitating some carefully selected particular image in a
                        surprisingly literal way. Bentley’s account of this invention
                        highlights the central problem that unites the essays in this collection,
                        the question of Blake’s originality, uniqueness, and novelty; or, to
                        put the matter in its more vexed form, the question of Blake as a copyist,
                        imitator, and borrower—a parasite on the art of his precursors and
                        contemporaries.</p>
          <p>A practical and sensible way out of this dilemma is the formula enunciated by
                        Morton Paley, who speaks for most of the other contributors on this issue:
                            <q> In discussing Blake’s theory and practice in the light of
                            traditions about ancient sculpture, we do not at all detract from his
                            uniqueness as an artist; nor do we violate Blake’s own view of
                            art. "The difference between a bad Artist &amp; a Good One,"
                            Blake wrote in his Annotations to Reynolds, "Is the Bad Artist
                            Seems to Copy a Great Deal: The Good One Really does Copy a Great
                            Deal" (E 634). Blake really did copy a great deal. The material he
                            copies often originated in other works of art but was assimilated by his
                            own mind and thoroughly recast, so that Blake could truly say, no matter
                            how important or how numerous his "sources," that he copied
                            Imagination. (193) </q> Paley’s formula raises, of course, as
                        many questions as it answers: What <hi rend="i">is</hi> the difference
                        between "seeming" to copy, and "really" copying? What
                        exactly is the "material" that is copied (motifs? style or
                        technique? inventions and compositional arrangements of figures?)? What does
                        "recasting" this material imply? Melting it down into a shapeless
                        mass to be molded into Blake’s own "new" forms? Or taking
                        the old forms and casting the raw material of new circumstances, ideas, and
                        meanings in those forms? What, finally, does it mean to "copy
                        Imagination"? Paley’s excellent essay on "Blake and Ancient
                        Sculpture" does not answer these questions, but it provides the
                        materials that might help us answer them, and his formula for reconciling
                        Blake’s tradition with his individual talent allows us to have our
                        cake, eat it too, and get on with the practical work of interpreting Blake:
                        Blake is an original copyist, an imaginative initator.</p>
          <p>But other voices are not able to utter this paradox with the same sort of
                        equanimity. David Bindman traces Blake’s theory and practice of
                        imitation to neoclassic traditions expressed by, among others,
                        Blake’s arch-foe, Joshua Reynolds, who claimed that "Invention,
                        strictly speaking, is little more than a new combination of those images
                        which have been previously gathered and deposited in the memory: mothing can
                        come of nothing: he who has laid up no materials can produce no
                        combinations" (quoted in Bindman, 93). But Bindman notes that
                        "there are potential problems in such imitation" for an artist who
                        has Blake’s sort of ambivalence about tradition: "So long as
                        Blake accepted the widespread eighteenth century assumption of the supremacy
                        of Greek art—and there is every evidence that he did so in the
                        1790s—then Blake’s practice of imitation did not present a
                        dilemma . . . . But after 1800 or so he began to turn against ‘the
                        silly Greek &amp; Latin slaves of the Sword’ (E 94) and to regard
                        Greek art and literature as Allegory rather than Inspiration; i.e., the
                        product of Memory rather than Imagination" (95). This turnabout was
                        not, however, accompanied by a straightforward repudiation of classical art
                        or art theory. "Unable to relinquish his profound feelings for Greek
                        art," Bindman argues, Blake devises from his "conflicting impulses
                        . . . one of the more bizarre artistic theories in the history of art, in
                        which all contradictions are reconciled and only historical probability is
                        sacrificed" (96). This is, of course, the notorious idea that classical
                        art is all derived from lost Hebrew prototypes, and is a weak (but the only
                        available) imitation of the divinely inspired originals. Blake’s
                        theory thus frees him to vilify classical art while borrowing from it, to
                        profess a Romantic theory of imagination and original inspiration while
                        practicing the classical method of imitation and invention. Bindman’s
                        theory psychologizes Paley’s paradox of the "original
                        copyist," making it the irrational solution to an insoluble conflict,
                        and historicizes it at the same time, presenting us with a classical Blake
                        to 1800, and an apparently anti-classical Blake after 1800. The really
                        fundamental Blake, however, remains for Bindman "eighteenth century in
                        spirit . . . determined even to the end of his career by classical
                        idealism" (98).</p>
          <p>One could wish for a strong counter-statement to Bindman’s
                        neoclassical Blake from the spokesmen for the Gothic tradition in this
                        volume. After all, one of the unmistakable "materials" of
                        Blake’s imitation is the illuminated manuscript, a form which
                        presupposes a rather different sense of artistic imitation based in the
                        roles of the scribe, grammarian, translator, and illustrator, and a
                        different sense of the text (radically unlike that of print culture) as open
                        to indefinite embellishment, correction, and imitative
                        "improvement" (this attitude persists in England at least up until
                        Dryden’s "creative" translations of Chaucer). The words
                        "imitation," "copy," and "invention," are not
                        exhaustively defined by eighteenth-century neoclassicism with its
                        Greco-Roman pantheon, its library of printed (and thus, in an important
                        sense, closed) classical texts, and its empirical, associationist psychology
                        of the creative process.</p>
          <p>The essays on Blake’s relation to Gothicism in this volume tend,
                        however, to treat this influence in a rather generalized way. Roger
                        Easson’s essay on "Blake and the Gothic" consists mainly of
                        pronouncements about "the Gothic reality" and "the Western
                        view of the world." When Easson descends to particulars his comments
                        often seem odd or unconvincing. "The decisive factor" in
                        neoclassical art is proclaimed to be "verisimilitude" defined as
                        representation of the "material world" (147; a cursory look at
                        Reynolds’ <hi rend="i">Discourses</hi> or at Bindman’s <pb id="p14-118" n="118"/> essay would correct this impression). We are told
                        that, for Blake, "the fall always has to do with the act of drawing
                        fine distinctions, differentiating between the Good and the Evil, between
                        heavy and light, between strong and weak, between right and wrong"
                        (152). Easson has here mixed a half-truth with a host of patent falsehoods.
                        It is true that Blake criticizes the construction of abstract
                        "Negations," particularly the reduction of existence to abstract
                        categories of good and evil. But no one has ever been more insistent than
                        Blake on the importance of "fine distinctions" and "minute
                        discriminations" as an intellectual and artistic duty, and this
                        includes the distinctions between right and wrong, honesty and dishonesty,
                        knaves and fools. This sort of obfuscation is not surprising, however, in an
                        essay which concludes by defining Blake’s Gothic as "the spirit
                        of vision that embraces mystery rather than allegory" (153), at one
                        fell swoop identifying Blake with a phenomenon (mystery) that he
                        consistently despised, and opposing him to a literary form which, with
                        qualifications, he practiced throughout his career.</p>
          <p>Edward J. Rose’s essay, "The Gothicized Imagination of
                        Michelangelo Blake," is considerably more substantial and reliable than
                        Easson’s, suggesting in its linkage of Michelangelo with the Gothic
                        tradition one way of mediating the conflict between the neoclassic and
                        Romantic versions of Blake, and pointing us toward an exemplary predecessor
                        who was himself a genius at "imitating" the antique, but in a
                        spirit rather unlike that of eighteenth-century neoclassicism. Yet
                        Rose’s essay leads to a conclusion which seems, curiously enough, to
                        leave Blake not "in his time" but more isolated than ever:
                        "Blake was not really committed to the direction of the art of the next
                        hundred years any more than he was at peace with the art of the hundred
                        years that preceded his time" (166).</p>
          <p>The best theoretical account of Blake’s struggle with the classical
                        tradition comes in Hazard Adams’ analysis of the annotations to
                        Reynolds’ <hi rend="i">Discourses.</hi> Adams shows, in the same
                        spirit as Bindman, that there are many issues on which there is "really
                        no contradiction" between Reynolds and Blake, "but Blake wants
                        there to be one," partly because of Blake’s resentment of
                        Reynolds’ status in the art world in contrast to his own neglect,
                        partly because of Blake’s fundamentally different understanding of
                        the psychology and epistemology of art. Adams is strongest in showing why
                        Blake attacks Reynolds’ disparagement of "minute neatness"
                        in imitation: "On the matter of this kind of deception [illusionistic
                        verisimilitude] Blake must have been in agreement with Reynolds" (134),
                        yet it is more important for Blake to defend "Minute Neatness of
                        Execution" than to concur with Reynolds’ attack on illusionsism,
                        because Blake wants to insist on a concrete, particular, and individualized
                        sense of the universal, as against Reynolds’ "general
                        form," an incoherent hybrid of Platonic and empirical psychology. On
                        "the whole matter of copying and drawing from models," Adams notes
                        that Blake "sometimes agrees and sometimes disagrees with
                        Reynolds" (138). Blake agrees with Reynolds’ idea that copying
                        is an essential part of artistic apprenticeship, the way to learn the
                        "language of art," but he takes issue with Reynolds’
                        relegation of copying to a <hi rend="i">merely</hi> preparatory function;
                        like "mechanical excellence" and "facility in composing"
                        (which Reynolds also disparages), copying is for Blake the activity of the
                        mature artist who "copies Imagination," and not a merely
                        subordinate or preliminary function. That is why Blake can sound even more
                        conservative and "classical" on the issue of copying than
                        Reynolds, calling "Servile Copying . . . the Great Merit of
                        Copying" (E 634): for Blake, ends and means, invention and execution,
                        realization and conception are not, as they are for Reynolds, separable
                        aspects of the creative act.</p>
          <p>The essays in <hi rend="i">Blake in His Time</hi> that deal with his
                        imitation of particular motifs or techniques of predecessors and
                        contemporaries tend to rely upon the formula of imitative transformation or
                        criticism without reflecting upon it, generally with useful results. Leslie
                        Tannenbaum’s "Blake and the Iconography of Cain" presents
                        the most deeply developed critical argument in this group, showing how
                        Blake’s pictorial treatments of the Cain and Abel story criticize the
                        sentimental and moralistic treatments that Blake could have known, and
                        transform the story into a "sublime" confrontation with the nature
                        of divine justice. The other essays on pictorial motifs are more in the line
                        of preliminary efforts, mapping out areas for future research. Jenijoy La
                        Belle’s discussion of "Blake’s Visions and Re-visions of
                        Michelangelo" traces one route of Michelangelo’s influence from
                        the Sistine frescoes through the sixteenth-century engravings of Adam Ghisi,
                        to the drawings which Blake made after these engravings when he was a
                        student. La Belle’s attempts to show significant "alterations in
                        emphasis" between original and copy are hampered, however, by the lack
                        of reproductions of many of the Ghisi engravings and Michelangelo originals.
                        One wishes also that La Belle had been more persistent in raising the
                        question of how much allusiveness to the original figure is operative in
                        Blake’s echoes of these motifs in later work: she seems content to
                        generalize Michelangelo’s figures into familiar <hi rend="i">pathos
                            formulae</hi> (thus "Blake learned from the Manasses lunette how to
                        show devitalized humanity," but is evidently unconcerned about who
                        Manasses is). The only figure from Michelangelo that La Belle credits with
                        "a pre-existing conceptual context" that Blake might have employed
                        allusively is that of the Prophet Daniel. Her conclusion, that Blake
                        "approached Michelangelo’s art in much the same way" that
                        he approached his own visions, "and that the usual distinction between
                        copying another artist and envisioning one’s own designs does not
                        pertain" (22), seems exactly right, and an important contribution to
                        the discussion of Blake’s concepts of imitation and invention. But if
                        it leads to an emptying out or generalizing of the "original"
                        which is being copied then it is hard to see how the imitation can have much
                        critical, transformative, or inventive content.</p>
          <p>The other two essays which deal with "regions" of Blake’s
                        imitation are solid, reliable efforts. Kay Easson’s discussion of
                        "Blake and the Art of the Book" is a good introduction to
                        Blake’s use of and departures from traditional patterns in the layout
                        of illustrated books. The most important departure <pb id="p14-119" n="119"/> is, of course, the Blakean invention of relief printing, a technological
                        "advance" which is employed, paradoxically, to "regress"
                        to the integrated form of the illuminated manuscript, and to eliminate the
                        division of labor and form (while employing the mechanical means) of the
                        modern illustrated book. Easson is very good on the ways in which Blake
                        imitates and parodies conventional features like tail-pieces, borders,
                        frames, column pictures, marginal designs, frontispieces, and title-pages,
                        but too often she is content merely to suggest that illustrative features
                        have significance without going on to say what that significance is.
                        Finally, Anne Mellor’s account of "Physiognomy, Phrenology, and
                        Blake’s Visionary Heads" is a judicious and workmanlike effort,
                        full of curious learning which (thank heavens!) is not taken too seriously,
                        as it certainly was not by Blake.</p>
          <p>One thing that must strike a reader of <hi rend="i">Blake in His Time</hi> is
                        the relative scarcity of professional art historians among its contributors.
                        It is one of the great misfortunes of Blake scholarship that he continues to
                        be neglected by all but a few art historians, and his pictures thus have to
                        be explained by moonlighting literary scholars. Aside from David Bindman,
                        whose training in traditional art history partly accounts for his
                        neoclassical version of Blake, the only certified art historian in this
                        volume is Martin Butlin, who finds himself explaining to the Blakeans what
                        would be perfectly obvious and trivial to an audience of art historians, the
                        mysteries of "Cataloguing William Blake." Butlin’s essay is
                        a treasure trove of information in problems of dating, authenticity, and the
                        nuances of "evidence of the eye," and should be studied
                        attentively by any Blake scholar concerned with the historical context of
                        Blake’s pictorial art.</p>
          <p>The other essays which focus on Blake’s pictorial achievement are the
                        work of literary critics who have been doing their homework in art history
                        for so long they should have honorary degrees. Jean Hagstrum contributes a
                        richly suggestive exploration of the possible influence of Romney’s
                        drawings on Blake’s early work, and Robert Essick discusses the
                        subject he probably understands better than any other scholar in the world,
                        Blake’s "iconography of techniques." Essick shows how
                        "controlled accidents" in Blake’s printing procedures can
                        take on significance—a significance that, one suspects, is sometimes
                        more attributable to the beholder than the creator. Essick seems on solid
                        ground when he discusses the multi-representational effect of patterns of
                        color printing which "refer simultaneously to geological, biological,
                        and psychological forms." But when we are told that Blake’s
                        "foul inking" on plate 47 of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> copy C
                        "is part of his revolt against empire, against the hegemony of machine
                        over man" (6), we feel that the boundaries of probability are being
                        breached. Either that or Blake was expressing in an ineffective and
                        self-defeating way what he was capable of saying much better in other
                        ways.</p>
          <p>I save for the last the two essays which deal with subjects closest to my own
                        interest in Blake, his work in composite art forms which unite poetry and
                        painting, and, by implication, time and space. Yvonne Carothers’
                        essay on "Space and Time in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>" is a worthy,
                        but seriously flawed attempt to relate Kant’s understanding of time
                        and space to Blake’s art (the flaws are: an understanding of Kant
                        which seems to come mainly through secondary sources; a failure to make an
                        argument as to why Blake should be connected with Kant; and some uncertainty
                        about exactly what the subject of the essay is). Joseph Wittreich’s
                        "Painted Prophecies," on the other hand, is one of the most
                        important essays on the nature of Blake’s composite art in recent
                        years. Wittreich takes up that side of the <hi rend="i">ut pictura
                            poesis</hi> tradition too often ignored by scholars steeped in the
                        classical tradition, the model of "sacramental" and Biblical
                        pictorialism embodied in the text and interpretive traditions of the Book of
                        Revelation. Wittreich surveys the complex variety of verbal/visual and
                        textual/pictorial relationships that inform the peculiar discourse of
                        prophecy: the prophetic experience as a psychological drama that combines
                        visual and verbal material; the rhetorical concept of visionary prophecy as
                        a "universal language of visual icons"; and descriptions of the
                        book which is given to John on Patmos as a scroll adorned with pictures and
                        hieroglyphs.</p>
          <p>There is an unacknowledged tension in Wittreich’s presentation,
                        however, that bears on the problem of original and copy that we have been
                        tracing throughout this volume. In one sense, of course, there is for the
                        prophetic artist no such thing as "imitation" in the classical
                        sense because the prophet is always at the origin, in direct, unmediated
                        contact with divine inspiration, and thus freed from the historical chain of
                        influence and imitation. The visual, visionary, and pictorial
                        characterizations of prophecy are, in fact, a way of stressing this
                        unmediated, intuitive access to the divine message. The verbal element of
                        prophecy is, for the commentators on Revelation, a kind of supplement to the
                        original message: "the assumption of all these commentators is that
                        Christ’s vision is presented initially as a picture; for
                        John’s (and our) sakes, that vision is preserved in a book, this time
                        with words accompanying the pictures; and this book, in turn, is translated
                        by John into the Apocalypse, into its verbal icons" (104). The text is
                        added as an accommodation "for our sakes".: it mediates,
                        preserves, and interprets the original vision for those of us who do not
                        have access to prophetic insight, or to the original illustrated scroll
                        given by Christ to St. John. But we need to ask at this point why these
                        secondary, supplemental steps are necessary if the original vision is
                        inscribed in the universal language of pictorial representation, the medium
                        which needs no learned reading or interpretation, but needs only be beheld
                        to be understood? Isn’t this universalizing and democratizing of the
                        divine message precisely the point of illustrating or illuminating the
                        sacred text? What else but this is the logic of producing an illustrated <hi rend="i">biblia pauperum</hi> that can be read by the illiterate laity?
                        Why doesn’t the prophet simply paint what he sees, or copy the
                        pictures from Christ’s scroll, thus eliminating the priestly, scribal
                        middleman who will become custodian of the prophet’s verbal
                        translation of the divine vision? The answer can only be that those pictures
                        are <hi rend="i">not</hi> transparent, unmediated, universally readable <pb id="p14-120" n="120"/> revelations of divine messages, but are
                        "concealed and dumb prophecies," hieroglyphs which require
                        interpretation, a verbal supplement to unveil their hidden meaning. The
                        pictorial expression no longer reveals the original inspiration but conceals
                        it, is no longer eloquent but dumb; the verbal translation no longer appears
                        as a superfluous covering or husk to the original prophetic picture, but
                        becomes "revelation in the litteral expression," a textual
                        expression of the original meaning intended by and concealed in the picture.
                        This new genealogy of prophetic expression reverses the priority of visual
                        to verbal expression insisted on by the commentators on Revelation, and
                        restores the priorities of Old Testament and English Protestant prophecy:
                        "There are three kinds of prophecy, says Luther in his 1545 Preface to
                        the Apocalypse: Moses’ kind which consists only of words,
                        Daniel’s which combines words with symbols, and John’s which
                        is purely visionary and consists only of ‘Pictures’"
                        (103). As Wittreich notes, "Hebrew law, in fact, forbade the kind of
                        pictorial adornment that Christianity encouraged" (104). The picture is
                        not simply supplemental and secondary, a necessary evil, but now becomes an
                        unnecessary evil, a vain idol to be smashed by the iconoclast.</p>
          <p>These reversals in the verbal/visual dialectic of prophetic poetics provide
                        new perspective on the exact character of Blake’s illuminated books.
                        Blake’s refusal to grant privilege or priority to text or design, his
                        construction of his illuminated books as a kind of icono-logo-machia, the
                        text a battleground of verbal and pictorial modes, is a strategy for
                        dramatizing a fundamental conflict in the network of religious signs upon
                        which he draws. The ambivalence about the icon or image in Protestant
                        culture, its double life as a transparent window on the divine message, or
                        an obscure hieroglyph which conceals that message and threatens to become an
                        object of idolatry—this ambivalence is converted by Blake into a
                        source of energy for the poetic and pictorial circuits of his illuminated
                        texts.</p>
          <p>The tension between verbal and visual expression which is revealed in
                        Wittreich’s account of "painted prophecies" also clarifies,
                        I would suggest, Blake’s complex attitude toward the problems of
                        origin and copy, invention and imitation. Verbal and pictorial modes are
                        continually discussed in prophetic poetics in terms of priority and
                        supplementation, "original" vision (or verbal message) and a
                        secondary translation, interpretation, or illumination which replaces,
                        transforms, or unveils the "original meaning" concealed in the
                        "original work." The relation of text and design shares in the
                        same dialectic that informs Blake’s understanding of copy and
                        original. The important distinction for Blake is not between copy and
                        original, but between a weak (or tame or "seeming") copy and a
                        strong, "real" copy. Blake could, like Bindman’s good
                        classicist, speak of imitation and invention, but without meaning quite the
                        same thing as Fuseli, whom Bindman quotes: <q> The term invention never
                            ought to be so far misconstrued as to be confounded with that of
                            creation, incompatible with our notions of limited being, an idea of
                            pure astonsishment, and admissable only when we mention Omnipotence; to
                            invent is to find: to find something, presupposes its existence
                            somewhere, implicitly or explicitly, scattered or in a mass. (93) </q>
                        What if one is a classicist who believes that the only omnipotent deity
                        worth mentioning is the one that "resides in the human breast,"
                        the Poetic Genius or human imagination? The notion of imitating a previous
                        work of art cannot be seen from this point of view as supplemental,
                        secondary, or parasitical, cannot be incompatible with creation. In fact,
                        "Imitation is Criticism," not a slavish copying of the external
                        form of a prior work, but an interpretation which reveals what the text has
                        previously hidden, an illumination or explanation. The "original
                        meaning" of a text is not lost, or locked forever in the receding
                        moment of its historical creation, but unfolds in the history of its
                        imitative interpretations. That is why Blake can seem to have both an
                        ahistorical view of art as unprogressive revelations of the imagination, and
                        yet see himself as building his own art progressively out of Milton and the
                        Bible (both read in the "infernal sense"), and out of a classical
                        tradition which has fallen prey to "tame imitation" by treating
                        its sacred texts as closed books, traces of an unrecoverable origin. When
                        Blake imitates a work of art (which will itself, he knows, be an
                        imitation—an engraving of a Renaissance master, a text which
                        supplements or interprets a vision, a picture which illustrates a text) he
                        imitates the original authority that enables human beings to construct for
                        themselves a world of signs, and thus "copies Imagination." There
                        is thus no distinction for Blake, as there is for Reynolds, between the
                        phase in the life of an artist, or the history of art, when we must copy and
                        invent: we learn the language of art by copying other works of art; we
                        execute original works of art by copying forever.</p>

          <p>With Blake of all writers most aware of the positives and negatives of
                        imposition in all its forms, does it help, I wonder, to distinguish the poet
                        read in Britain from the poet read in North America? If so, then British
                        Blake is the function of an audience not entirely sure that their poet
                        "makes sense," and one which tends to insist that where he does
                        make sense then it is in terms of a directly embodied concrete image,
                        historical pressure, or social outrage. Conversely, American Blake might be
                        cast as the apostle of visionary novelty and eternal history, a poet
                        therefore infinitely generative of further critical riches, neither wanting
                        nor daring to stop (for there lies standing water), and conformable thereby
                        to a logic of the imaginative body and bodily discovery, one suggesting the
                        secondary determinability of culture and history by the devolutions of the
                        individual mind which is divine. Blockages may appear, and repetition invade
                        creation, but the blockages are never quite the same twice running.</p>
          <p>Complications of course arise. The best book on British Blake has been
                        written in America, by David Erdman, and it may be that the above version of
                        American Blake is to be related to the generations of the late 1960s. But I
                        find the distinction useful if only as a way to say that there is very
                        little of that American Blake in this British book. Two versions of Blake,
                        in the form of two questions addressed to him, may be specified in it.
                        First, does he make sense? As usual, this question tends not to question
                        itself, never recognizing "sense" as ideological rather than
                        universal. Fortunately, there is not too much of this. Second, where does
                        Blake stand in history, and can we establish a history which entitles us to
                        dismiss certain kinds of ambiguity or puzzlement as beside the point, while
                        establishing others as central to "meaning"? This second question
                        is more firmly and usefully addressed, if not always with the
                        self-consciousness one might hope for in the presentation of its
                        implications. But then self-consciousness and dialectical agility tend not
                        to belong to British Blake, being matters ordered in France.</p>
          <p>Michael Phillips’ brief introduction indeed tries to set the tone of
                        what is to follow. He promises a series of "close analyses"
                        helping us to "read and objectively explain" Blake’s
                        meanings. Indeterminacy is insinuated, but only under constraint:
                        "Where interpretation is concerned, an essential principle has been
                        observed that it should not be imposed" (p. 1). No patience here, it
                        seems, with those who see only imposition; or those who find, as I myself
                        do, a more troublesome and dialectical obligation in the concept of
                        "interpretation," one which questions or at least demands closer
                            <pb id="p14-122" n="122"/> definition of the aspiration to
                        "articulate objectively." The best essays in this book do address
                        themselves to that aspiration.</p>
          <p>The anthology opens with E. P. Thompson’s "London," a poem
                        which is notoriously central to the debate between history, vision, and
                        visionary history. In its length and closeness of focus, Thompson’s
                        reading must be admitted to the canon of "necessary reading" for
                        this poem. The thesis is that "London" is a "unitary
                        analysis" (p. 20) of a historical condition, a poem whose
                        "symbolic organization is within the clearly conceived and developing
                        logic of market relations" (p. 22). The strongest part of this case is
                        the context provided for Blake’s use of the word
                        "charter’d," which is I think of undeniable importance. The
                        other word on which Thompson spends a good deal of time is, predictably,
                        "mark." Though he generally claims to accept "seventeen types
                        of ambiguity in Blake" (p. 15), Thompson strongly objects to any
                        "gesture towards an ulterior ‘ambivalence’ in which Blake
                        has assimilated the damned to the elect." Such a reading would
                        "destroy the poem" and introduce "into its heart a direct
                        contradiction of intention and of feeling." A possible reference to <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi> is dismissed as that to <hi rend="i">Revelation</hi> is asserted. Blake is "not setting marks on
                        foreheads, he is observing them" (p. 12).</p>
          <p>I find this case interestingly tendentious. Perhaps the word
                        "heart" tells all. Do poems have hearts? No, the people who write
                        them do. But could not that heart be divided between intention and feeling,
                        and could not that division itself be an important part of social history?
                        For Thompson, it seems that the heart is what gives authority to unambiguous
                        perception, and to a social outrage uncontaminated by self-implication. The
                        logic of the heart is an important theme in nineteenth-century literature,
                        and I hope my point does not seem trite. What is the credibility, for
                        example, of the unitary heart with which Dickens endows Esther Summerson in
                            <hi rend="i">Bleak House</hi>? Can we not ask questions about its
                        sufficiency? Are we not meant to? In making Blake an angry outsider,
                        commenting on a situation with which he has nothing to do, and which he
                        objectively transcribes, Thompson removes him from membership of that class
                        of dialectically constructed Romantic subjectivities who experienced
                        alienation not as something going on <hi rend="i">around</hi> them but also
                        as something reduplicated or created <hi rend="i">within</hi> them. Thus
                        Wordsworth is able to chronicle, with an honesty which at times almost
                        creates incoherence, the problems of power and exchange which occur in the
                        most solitary encounters and the most spontaneous perceptions. The mind is
                        inescapably social even in its assertions of separateness, and a wider
                        reading of Blake might at least suggest a poet very well aware of the
                        intersubjective determinants and consequences of outrage. I cannot quite <hi rend="i">complain</hi> that Thompson wants a Blake who is pure of heart
                        and eye (an unregenerated Milton?), devoted to one law and one polemic,
                        without being uncomfortably aware of the literary critic’s besetting
                        interest in ambiguity. But I can wish him to be more aware of the
                        alternative <hi rend="i">history</hi> of consciousness which I think he is
                        ignoring.</p>
          <p>Thompson’s reading of the last two stanzas is, to my mind, less
                        convincingly maintained. The idea that there is a reference to "the
                        smoke of expanding commerce" (p. 16) in the word "blackning"
                        needs refining. Commerce itself does not produce smoke. Industry does, and
                        it is industry which helps to make commerce possible. This may seem a
                        pernickety objection, but to ask what kind of <hi rend="i">industry</hi>
                        Blake might have had in mind seems to me rather important for the poem.
                        Erdman notes that London in 1803 was not so much a standard factory town as
                        "a war arsenal and the hub of the machinery of war."<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> Could it have been so earlier, at the
                        time "London" was being meditated? If so, then this would specify
                        Blake’s positioning of commerce as hand-in-hand with empire and war.
                        Taken together with Erdman’s reading of this poem, which suggests
                        that the "hapless soldier" could be either the foreign mercenary
                        or indeed the now superfluous English yeoman made redundant by him (pp.
                        277-78), we can see an important issue here. The wealth which enabled the
                        king to afford mercenaries would have been related to commerce, and J. G. A.
                        Pocock’s work has shown us the importance of this debate in the
                        eighteenth century.<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> Commerce erodes the
                        rights of freeborn Englishmen by replacing militias with standing armies in
                        the pay of the king, as it also erodes their capacity for civic virtue.
                        Instead of being self-sufficient and self-determining, they now indirectly
                        pay other people to fight their wars. They therefore have no control over
                        war, which can happen without their wanting it, and in addition a force has
                        been created which can be turned against the people itself. If this
                        situation is indeed behind Blake’s poem, then it importantly
                        differentiates him from an economist like Adam Smith, who had seen in
                        commerce and free trade a civilizing and peacemaking function. Soldiers too
                        may be chartered, and hapless in their expression of the alienation imposed
                        upon them by the division of labor; haplessness affects both those employed
                        and those displaced and affronted. <note id="n1"><hi rend="s">1</hi> David

          <p>Thompson’s essay concludes with an account and eventual dismissal of a
                        Swedenborgian context for the poem. Finding Swedenborg’s writing
                        "remote from experiential controls and affective references" (p.
                        26), he concludes that it has little to do with "London." What he
                        says of Swedenborg is, however, a useful preliminary to Morton
                        Paley’s more extended account of the relation between Swedenborg and
                        Blake’s writing (<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 50).</p>
          <p>Focus is widened somewhat in Heather Glen’s essay,
                        "Blake’s Criticism of Moral Thinking in <hi rend="i">Songs of
                            Innocence and of Experience.</hi>" The argument is that the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> both express and subvert the terms and assumptions
                        of "contemporary ethical discussion" (p. 32), showing forth a
                        "distrust of moral thinking itself" (p. 33). By "moral
                        thinking" Glen means not only the assertive imposition or deduction of
                        values, but also the more elusive logic of the feelings—charity,
                        pity, and so forth. The case is carried on in a close reading of several
                        among the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, paying particular attention to the status
                        of the speaking voice, and to the metrical patterns and local ambiguities
                        that enforce it. Impressively, this traditionally "literary" way
                        of reading is incorporated with a historical specification of the allusions
                        these poems demand or invite. Readings <pb id="p14-123" n="123"/> of
                        "The Chimney Sweeper" of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>, of the two
                        "Holy Thursday" poems, of "London," and of "The
                        Human Abstract" are offered. In general they contrast usefully and
                        provocatively with Thompson’s account of "London," in their
                        argument for inclusive rather than exclusive reference (see, for example,
                        Glen’s comments on "mark"). Thus the figure of the sweep is
                        described as a "potent image of subversive passion" (p. 42) in
                        ways which are at once sexual, social, and political. Not that Glen presents
                        ambivalence as itself a virtue; on the contrary, she composes it into a more
                        sophisticated concept of the "unitary" than the one Thompson
                        offers. In so doing, she leads us closer to the point where social and
                        individual determination coincide in the construction of Blake’s
                        speakers.</p>
          <p>In this achievement, it might in fact be said that Glen goes almost too far.
                        The speaker of "London" is thus presented as "imaginatively
                        bankrupt" (p. 57), one who is "more deeply and consciously
                        implicated in the abstracting modes of his society than anyone else"
                        (p. 60). Glen’s general contention about the speakers of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> is that they reveal "the same abstracting,
                        distancing strategies which have produced the social consequences that they
                        seek to condemn" (p. 66). Why, then, should the speaker of
                        "London" be <hi rend="i">more</hi> deeply contaminated by this
                        habit of mind than others in his society? This seems to me to go too far in
                        locating essential responsibility with the speaker; it fails to stress
                        (though it implies) the degree to which his options about what to <hi rend="i">see</hi> are themselves foreclosed and pressured by what is
                        around him, the real historical situation whose terms we can adduce from
                        Thompson and Erdman. (It depends, too, on an implicit antithesis between the
                        innocent and experienced speakers which we need not, I think, follow.) The
                        point may be tested against Glen’s reading of the second of the
                        "Holy Thursday" poems. She admits that this is a difficult case,
                        and one is grateful for an account of this often ignored poem. It becomes
                        wholly a poem about the speaker, who is presented as totally cut off from
                        what is <hi rend="i">really</hi> around him in a gesture of hysterical moral
                        inscription. He "reduces things to their moral qualities, and robs them
                        of their rich reality"; he is responsible for a linguistic vapidity
                        which gives no sense of "a rendition of a real scene, the expression of
                        a moment when the speaker saw what was before him with more than usual
                        vividness and clarity" (p. 54). Glen’s reading is more
                        sophisticated than I suggest here, and is to be taken seriously, but I want
                        to pick out this contention to highlight a question: is there really a
                        "rich reality" which the speaker simply cannot see because of
                        strictly subjective limitations? This suggests that the speaker’s
                        view is in fact <hi rend="i">not</hi> socially determined, and does not at
                        all represent what is <hi rend="i">there.</hi> Thompson might well complain,
                        and I would complain with him, that this view does not allow for any
                        credibility or conviction at all in the voice of outrage. Surely the details
                        of the world of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> are not just "a series of
                        self-produced abstractions" (p. 56)? It is in the nature of social
                        institutions that they are already there when a new generation opens its
                        eyes, and it is a fact of particular societies that they produce particular
                        forms of defining the human condition, differently indeed for different
                        people. Chapels, palaces, and arsenals were and are built, and constitute
                        what it would not be ambitious to call a <hi rend="i">reality</hi>. I think
                        this is a point at which Glen could afford to make the assumptions implicit
                        in her thesis more clear, and indeed more historical. Is Blake a Godwinian
                        idealist who believes that revolutions of the mind precede and determine
                        social structures, and does he then rely on the same prospectus for
                        "truth" as Godwin does, that once put abroad it will spread and
                        conquer by its own energies, without revolutionary effort? Or is he a more
                        devious and deflected spirit, conscious, like Wordsworth, of all that
                        interferes with the development of the mind (perhaps initially innocent,
                        perhaps not)? My own sense is that Blake partakes of both these figures; he
                        often implies that the subjective imagination is a way beyond the
                        constraints of imposed ways of seeing, but those constraints are there to be
                        reexperienced again in the periods when the claims of habitual perception
                        accrue. This mediated view of Blake becomes itself "historical"
                        when we recognize all that came in the way, in the 1790s, of openly
                        expressed revolutionary fervor, and understand the pressures toward the
                        advocacy of private experiences as redemptive. (No one has done more than
                        Thompson, in <hi rend="i">The Making of the English Working Class</hi>, to
                        make this information available.) In the <hi rend="i">communication</hi> of
                        that privacy, I think that Blake made a place for all the versions of
                        pathological and social opposition which occur when interests clash in the
                        forum of "meaning" and authority. Glen’s is a fine essay,
                        but it would be the poorer if it were not set against what is of worth in
                        Thompson’s more trenchant pronouncements. Taken together, they
                        present a useful tension to help us decide between authoritatively
                        single-hearted and hysterically alienated speakers in Blake’s <hi rend="i">Songs.</hi></p>
          <p>Frank M. Parisi’s "Emblems of Melancholy: <hi rend="i">For
                            Children: The Gates of Paradise</hi>," shifts the focus wholly from
                        the verbal to the visual aspect of Blake’s work. Concentrating on the
                        first issue of these designs, Parisi seeks to recover what Blake
                        "originally intended" (p. 71) by them, which he argues to be an
                        embodying of and response to eighteenth century conventions of melancholy:
                            <q> My conclusion is that the <hi rend="i">Gates</hi> presents the life
                            of fallen man as a melancholy cycle turning on frustration, defeat and
                            despair, the more insidious for being self-renewing. At the same time
                            the <hi rend="i">Gates</hi> goes far beyond contemporary analogues, for
                            it points unequivocally to a way one may break out of the cycle into a
                            visionary and creative state. (p. 74) </q> Let me say at once that I am
                        in no sense qualified to offer a proper assessment of the success or failure
                        of this argument. But I will say that I am not given much information on
                        which to base a judgment. For an essay which discusses entirely visual
                        contexts, it is perversely under-illustrated. One might perhaps pass over
                        the absence of Blake’s own designs, which have often been reproduced
                        elsewhere, though this is at the least an inconvenience. But I frequently
                        find that reference is made to, and arguments built on, pictures or
                        engravings which are not reproduced. For example, <pb id="p14-124" n="124"/>
                        Dürer’s <hi rend="i">Melencolia I</hi> is often cited as of
                        great importance: but we have to head for a library to confirm that
                        importance. Exhaustive descriptions of things which depend for conviction on
                        being <hi rend="i">seen</hi> make this essay very hard to follow. Other
                        frustrations appear in an occasional lack of evidence, or lack of
                        consideration of alternatives. What is the force of seeing the
                        "butterflies" of plate 7 as "the female aspect of
                        nature" (p. 73), and of Blake’s conversion of a traditional
                        motif into anthropomorphic images? Why is the insect of the frontispiece a
                        "worm" rather than a caterpillar (p. 76)? It is about as obvious a
                        caterpillar as one could hope for, and clearly differentiated from the worm
                        of plate 16. Points like this matter because they threaten to qualify the
                        whole drift of Parisi’s argument, making the designs look more like
                        what Erdman saw as a "series illustrating the progression of
                        contraries" (p. 204). Against this, Parisi wants to argue that plate 13
                        is the only one which offers a pointer beyond the constraints of earthly
                        melancholy. The rest belong to a "closed cycle" and present a
                        "problematic view of life" (p. 108). See the worm as a
                        caterpillar, however, and it is hard not to think also of the butterfly, and
                        of its immanence as an emblem of the soul. Moreover, if plate 13 really is
                        authoritative in the way Parisi suggests, "the most articulate event in
                        the series" (p. 110), why does it not come at the end? At least, one
                        might ask for some discussion of the point of its <hi rend="i">not</hi>
                        being final.</p>
          <p>There are good things in this essay. The context provided for resolving (or
                        beginning to resolve) the nature of Blake’s response to Gillray
                        (noted by Erdman, pp. 202-04) in plate 9 is well-constructed, taking us
                        through Ariosto, Milton and Burton. Indeed, on every design Parisi has
                        something new and insightful to say. There seems to be no doubt that Blake
                        invokes reference to desire and melancholy at key points in the series.
                        However, I remain unconvinced that the invocation of melancholy constitutes
                        the unitary message of these designs. There is an obvious problem with
                        visual images in that their significations are naturally less determinate
                        than verbal ones often are; I am left wanting a stronger case, with more
                        evidence illustrated, to convince me that the essay does all that it says it
                        does. But, with this essay more than the others, I must plead a measure of
                        incompetence.</p>
          <p>Harald A. Kittel’s "<hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> and <hi rend="i">An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</hi>" poses a
                        different kind of difficulty. There is much here of real value and interest,
                        but its leading ideas are not emphasized with sufficient force. This
                        produces an argument of considerable density, likely to inform at first only
                        those already very familiar with the special vocabularies Locke uses. It
                        lacks the declaration of priorities which makes the first chapter of
                        Frye’s <hi rend="i">Fearful Symmetry</hi> so memorable. There is also
                        some confusion about what <hi rend="i">kind</hi> of relation is being argued
                        for between the two texts; this becomes problematic because of the closeness
                        of the correspondences apparently being adduced. Is Blake really reading
                        Locke closely, and incorporating point-by-point responses to his arguments,
                        or is there in <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> a general satire on the rational
                        tradition which Locke’s <hi rend="i">Essay</hi> happens, in exemplary
                        ways, to embody? Kittel reads <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> as "satire
                        directed against John Locke’s theory of knowledge" (p.
                        111)—in other words, principally against the second book of the <hi rend="i">Essay</hi>—but it is only at the end of his account that
                        he admits that "<hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> is neither a systematic nor an
                        explicit critique of Locke’s <hi rend="i">Essay.</hi> Nevertheless,
                        elements of Locke’s theory of knowledge affect theme, symbolism and
                        structure of the poem" (p. 143). Had this declaration come earlier, it
                        might have suggested to the author that he look elsewhere in the rationalist
                        tradition for suggestions informing the argument and imagery of the poem.
                        Newton, for example, is not mentioned, and yet Donald Ault has published a
                        very important book on the Blake-Newton relation, with significant reference
                        to <hi rend="i">Urizen.</hi><ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> For
                        example, Kittel glosses the "globes of attraction" (<hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> 3:36) as specifying reference to Locke’s primary
                        qualities—bulk, figure, texture, and motion of parts—whereas a
                        much more obvious allusion, to my mind, is to atomism (planets as atoms
                        involves the familiar Blakean conjunction of microcosm and macrocosm) and to
                        its exponents in scientific method, Newton and perhaps Boyle, whose account
                        of forms and qualities itself informed Locke’s argument but was
                        stressed by Locke in a different way. Globes of attraction are the primary
                        particles of matter or body which are variously composed into form, whether
                        through names alone (as suggested by Boyle) or through some form of
                        figurative perception. As such, they do indeed lie behind Locke’s
                        account of qualities, but in a way which brings out the <hi rend="i">mental</hi> element in the apprehension of "things" (an
                        element stressed also by Hobbes). Locke is here much more sophisticated than
                        he was often seen to be by later readers who saw in him merely the apologist
                        of materialism, and Kittel’s over-brief statement of the connection
                        misses the complexity of Locke’s account, as it deals with the way in
                        which qualities are assembled into "things" (which things Hobbes
                        had actually called "phantasms"). He thus does not stress the
                        radically <hi rend="i">unstable</hi> element in Locke’s epistemology,
                        which in fact could be taken to inform a much more thoroughly
                        "Romantic" notion of how we perceive. Ault (p. 59) argues in this
                        context for a discontinuity between Newton and Locke over how
                        "reality" is knowable, and over what it is that is called
                        "real." What matters most for Locke is how we <hi rend="i">share</hi> perceptions. Although information comes to us through the
                        senses, it takes mental processes to convert it into <hi rend="i">ideas</hi>, and it is the nature of that conversion which was so widely
                        argued. If it is done through <hi rend="i">names</hi>, which impose unitary
                        identity on assemblies of ideas, and thus insinuate the idea of substance,
                        then Kittel passes over a useful angle on his own case for Urizen as imaging
                        Locke’s complex idea of substance (p. 128). For the name
                        "Urizen" is itself infinitely decomposable (you reason, your
                        reason, horizon, etc.), just as the identities of Los and Urizen
                        consistently merge and overlap throughout the book. Locke argues for
                        personal identity in consciousness, not in substance (<hi rend="i">Essay</hi>, II, ch. 27, 19); Urizen finds that both body and
                        consciousness shift and divide, or impose impossible pressures on themselves
                        in trying not to. Urizen’s faith in one law, and one name, then
                        becomes a satire on something Locke’s theory might itself satirize; a
                        belief in the substantial identity of something which has a name. <note id="n3"><hi rend="s">3</hi> Donald D. Ault, <hi rend="i">Visionary

          <p>I think that the reader who does not already know Locke will find this essay
                        very hard to follow; and the reader who does might wish for fuller
                        explanations of some of the subtleties of Locke’s positions. His
                        rather evasive use of arguments from divine sanction ("our Maker")
                        and its relation to the coherence of the social contract might be seen to
                        inform Urizen’s parodic construction of a community, one which
                        attempts to be a series of self-images. Does Blake mean to imply the inner
                        identity of consent and authoritarian mandate? "I am your reason"?
                        Kittel’s account of the Urizenic versions of space and time also
                        needs, to my mind, stronger emphasis. They are clearly very important to the
                        poem, and Ault has much to say of them. They have a suggestive relation,
                        moreover, to the questions of narration (text/time) and perspective
                        (design/space) which are deliberately put into crisis in this poem. Perhaps
                        different readers will find this essay helpful in different ways, and impose
                        emphases for themselves. I think the notion of Urizen’s world being
                        composed of primary qualities (pp. 127, 136) is an interesting one (though I
                        would then want some analysis of his relation to the Eternals, which need
                        not be read as straightforwardly negative), and I am fascinated by the
                        suggestion that the basis of the Urizenic mode in deferral by rational
                        decision (pp. 118, 140) might come from Locke. This suggests nothing less
                        than a taxonomy of desire, which was of great importance to the eighteenth
                        century: witness, for example, its place in Adam Smith’s <hi rend="i">The Theory of Moral Sentiments.</hi> Locke’s delineation of
                        rational doubt, whereby "we are able to suspend the present
                        satisfaction of any desire" (II, ch. 21, 52), is full of prophetic
                        futurity in this respect. Thus do sun and moon go out.</p>
          <p>Peter Butter’s contribution, "<hi rend="i">Milton</hi>: The Final
                        Plates," is of a kind which makes me wonder whether opposition can
                        really be true friendship, and leaves me affirming a case for refusing to
                        meet halfway. It belongs to the "Does it make sense?" aspect of
                        British Blake, but unfortunately sense itself is not questioned or
                        reconstituted. Butter’s curiosity emanates from a genre of literary
                        criticism which nowadays tends not to read Blake at all. Thus his comments
                        will strike readers variously as refreshing bursts of common sense or as
                        grotesquely out of place appeals to an inhibitive consensus. Of course, one
                        must beware of demanding that every reader of Blake should approach with
                        reverence and take off his shoes before walking on the purples. And, in one
                        way, this essay partakes of some of the negative virtues of Leavis’
                        classic misreading of Shelley,<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> which by
                        the very precision of its dismissals alerts us to an ulterior motive in
                        Shelley, and an alternative way of reading. Thus Butter looks for "an
                        immediate appeal to the senses" (p. 147), for something "touching
                        and effective" (p. 148), and for what helps us to "visualize . . .
                        clearly" (p. 149). His war-cry is indeed the classic one of "fully
                        realized presence" (p. 157), and needless to say it does not come up
                        with much to admire in this poem. When Butter says that Blake too often
                        "leaves the reader without firm ground under his feet" (p. 157), I
                        am reminded of a whole tradition of firmness, concretion, grasping and
                        embodying (different from Thompson, who at least provides the heart). It
                        belongs to the browbeating school of criticism which asserts that
                        "poetic quality" (p. 145) is an entity mysteriously removed from
                        ideas, and to be elucidated from the loaded comparison of good poets and bad
                        poets. <note id="n4"><hi rend="s">4</hi> F. R. Leavis, <hi rend="i">Revaluation: Tradition and Development in English Poetry</hi>

          <p>Substantially, the centerpiece of Butter’s account is the argument
                        that Satan is presented incoherently, and that is perhaps the issue on which
                        readers might most profit from his essay. However, I hope it would not be
                        adjudicated with exclusive reference to the end of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>,
                        which even the most diligent readers are unlikely to resort to with
                        expectations of immediate transparency. Blake might have expected a reader
                        who had seen the rest of the poem, and perhaps knew something of John
                        Milton; he undeniably would have expected a reader who saw before him a
                        composite art, and not just a text on a page. Remarkably, Butter manages to
                        discuss the end of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> without any reference to the
                        designs (which by now should hardly surprise us in this anthology), and
                        without any mention of sexuality. Who are the naked figures on the rock in
                        the famous full-page plate, reengraved for copy D? Albion and
                        Jerusalem/Babylon? Milton and Ololon? Blake and Catherine, waking from a
                        dream? Prometheus, now joined by a female, and with the eagle of Zeus now
                        also bespeaking prophecy in dismemberment? Had he at least <hi rend="i">looked</hi> at the plates, in some modest acknowledgment of what Blake
                        actually "wrote," Butter might have found some clues to the
                        problem of identity which bothers him when he finds (e.g., p. 152) more than
                        one persona offering itself for the ownership of a pronoun.</p>
          <p>The test of this kind of essay must be, I think, whether the impositions are
                        generous or not. Ultimately, it is not the things of which I have written
                        above which I find myself resenting most strongly; it is the tactic of false
                        modesty. In the same paragraph we find the conventional critical
                        humility—"With more understanding I shall probably withdraw some
                        of the criticisms in this essay"—and the firm dismissal which it
                        is used to insinuate: Blake becomes one "whose command of language is
                        not equal to the reach of his imagination" (p. 163). As proof of this,
                        we have a gallery of the dirty tricks which are the embarrassment of the
                        trade. A comparison is introduced—"These lines remind one of
                        Hopkins"—only to be turned immediately into a
                        judgment—"Hopkins’ lines convey greater intensity than
                        Blake’s longer and slacker ones"—without the relevance of
                        Hopkins (or anybody else) ever being established. Literary history exists
                        here as an unanalyzed spectrum of the effective and the less effective, the
                        one functioning as a stick with which to beat the other. Butter centers
                        himself as the arbiter of taste, the "literary critic" who is
                        "entitled to ask the questions" (p. 161), having dismissed (as it
                        happens) Harold Bloom as a critic "telling his own story";
                        something which, we are told with coy humor, is "quite common in Blake
                        studies" (p. 155).</p>
          <p>If opposition is to be friendship, then there is no place in it for the
                        smiler with the knife under the cloak. This is British Blake at its worst, a
                        product of difficulty and embarrassment which has gone hard, so that it is
                        no longer felt <pb id="p14-126" n="126"/> or thought out. Like those who
                        complain of the limited number of orifices in the human body, Butter finds
                        in the prophetic books an "obsessive return to a rather small number of
                        ideas, repeated sometimes without enough variation or addition to make the
                        repetition acceptable" (p. 157). This essay, to my mind (and I am a
                        partial reader), has no ideas at all.</p>
          <p>James Ferguson’s "Prefaces to <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>"
                        sets out to show that the four prefaces to the four chapters of the poem
                        provide structural guidelines for reading it. The themes he selects for
                        emphasis are interesting in themselves, but they do not provide what we seem
                        to be promised, which is a firm anticipation in the prefaces of the most
                        important ideas in the poem. Moreover, themes are selected from each of the
                        prefaces, which are thus in no sense completely expounded or interpreted.
                        From the first, Ferguson takes up the issue of style (mildness and
                        ruggedness), but explores it in a way which is neither historical (as an
                        analysis of the conventions Blake reacts to might be) or intrinsic in any
                        fully sustained way. Stylistic plurality and many-voicedness are undoubtedly
                        very important in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, but in much deeper ways than
                        Ferguson seems to specify. Ruggedness, for example, is explained almost by
                        apology, as "by no means the most important of the diverse poetic
                        styles to which Blake refers in his defence" (p. 169), instead of being
                        recognized as an integral part of meaning and idea, which is how Blake might
                        well have meant it to be seen. The accounts of Reuben, Rehab and Ezekiel
                        (very useful in themselves) which form the substance of the rest of the
                        essay seem to be very loosely connected to the prefaces to chapters 2, 3,
                        and 4, so that I begin to wonder if Ferguson has forgotten his own thesis.
                        Scholars concerned with the interpretation of those figures should certainly
                        not miss this essay, but Ferguson’s claim to set forth a new
                        structural patterning does not convince me. The essay is thus not quite an
                        authoritative introduction for people coming to the poem for the first time,
                        but it does illuminate certain special items in it.</p>
          <p>The book concludes with John Beer’s "Influence and Independence
                        in Blake," which not only summarizes and (very modestly) answers many
                        of the positions taken up by other authors in the volume, but does so
                        without distracting attention from its own subject matter. The essay
                        presents a synopsis of problems encountered and methods adopted in reading
                        Blake for influences, and proceeds under the control of a most admirable
                        self-consciousness. Beer states his positions and declares his assumptions.
                        The tact is genuine, informing the arguments themselves rather than
                        remaining a preliminary ploy. Seeing Blake as an artist whose response to
                        influence was "dominated above all by his own obsessive concerns"
                        (p. 202), Beer examines a series of ways in which we might find Blake to
                        have been influenced.</p>
          <p>Dealing first with visual sources, he produces one of the few arguments in
                        this book which is adequately illustrated. Two kinds of influence are
                        examined. First, that of a general context, in this case the iconographic
                        conventions surrounding the "Ugolino" scene in late eighteenth
                        century art. A very convincing case is made for Blake being aware of a
                        reading of the incident as depicting "the tyranny of the
                        priesthood" (p. 207). Second, the possible bearing of the engraving of
                        Cipriani’s "Perseus and Andromeda" on the frontispiece to
                        ‘Visions of the Daughters of Albion’ is rehearsed. Here, the
                        influence (if it is there) is more specific and direct.</p>
          <p>In the account of possible modes of verbal influence, Beer’s comments
                        on the word "mark" in "London" (pp. 218-21) offer a
                        response to Thompson and Glen, and also add something else, a possible
                        Shakespearean echo. He sees the range of choices open to the reader of the
                        poem as rather wider than the other two authors do, but at the same time he
                        communicates a sense of the urgency of choosing. Ambivalence is not
                        avoidance, but a form of crisis. In general, the remarks on verbal influence
                        open up an area of possible influence on Blake which is comparatively new
                        (at least to me); that composed by seventeenth century literature. Allusions
                        he finds to Donne and Herbert are especially interesting, and there is a
                        convincing account of the neoplatonic background to Blake’s use of
                        the word "intellectual" (pp. 221-23), and of the philosophical
                        contexts for the word "inlet" (pp. 223-27). Of particular
                        relevance to Kittel’s case is Beer’s reading of Blake’s
                        "minute particulars" (pp. 227-29) in the context of specific
                        passages in Locke’s <hi rend="i">Essay.</hi> He sees a positive
                        implication (for Blake) in Locke’s description of "minute
                        particles, which open out a source of light that would otherwise be
                        invisible to the eye . . . bringing out the visionary nature of every detail
                        while remaining faithful to their own nature" (p. 229). Locke becomes,
                        in this way, a precursor of imaginative vision.</p>
          <p>Having described and embodied ways of plotting specific influences in both
                        visual and verbal contexts. Beer passes on (p. 237f.) to an assessment of
                        "extensive influences," those which may be thought to have been
                        behind Blake’s work over an extended period of time. Three successive
                        pages of Whichcote’s <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> are seen to appear
                        in various forms and at various points in Blake’s writings, and a
                        similar "cluster of words and expressions" (p. 241) is discovered
                        in Pope’s "Eloisa to Abelard."</p>
          <p>The final section of the essay makes a case for the importance of alchemical
                        imagery and reference in <hi rend="i">Tiriel.</hi> The result of the whole
                        is to suggest the highly eclectic and specifically motivated nature of
                        Blake’s philosophical, literary, and artistic borrowings or stimuli.
                        The coherence which ensues then beomes a function of "Blake’s
                        originating artistic identity" (p. 261), which is able to react to a
                        wide range of influence without ever merely repeating a preestablished
                        doctrine. Influence is neither anxious nor burdensome; it provides a field
                        of intellectual and imaginative experience for redisposition and
                        interpretation. It is imagination, not guilt or shame, which determines
                        Blake’s reconstruction of the past. Implicitly, Beer frees Blake from
                        some of the limits imposed upon him by other authors in the book who have
                        more monothematic priorities.</p>
          <p>If one were to ask "What is the audience for <pb id="p14-127" n="127"/>
                        these essays?" then Beer’s essay comes through with the clearest
                        answer. In its wealth of local observation and specific attentions (which I
                        have not done justice to), it will be of use to any specialist. At the same
                        time, because of the clarity and self-consciousness of its format and
                        taxonomy, it comes over as a very recommendable starting point for, say, a
                        graduate student reading Blake for the first time, and wanting to know what
                        methods and approaches are possible. It has both scholarly and pedagogical
                        virtues, and as such it sets a standard which few of the other essays
                        attain. Glen and Thompson, to my mind, come closest to it, but they are best
                        taken as a pair, with interesting questions arising from the interaction of
                        the two accounts. The teacher who wishes to suggest to students a mode of
                        close reading which is both literary and historical could confidently
                        recommend Glen’s essay, in particular.</p>
          <p>For essays which took so long in coming into print—five years between
                        the Edinburgh conference and the appearance of the book—many parts of
                        the other essays have an unfinished quality, as if the passage from first
                        draft to reworked statement has not been made. This may appear as an
                        omission of the emphasis helpful to a reader in following an argument, or as
                        the ignoring of alternative possibilities supplied by the work of other
                        critics. More seriously, the book as a whole is lamentably
                        under-illustrated. This applies to Parisi’s essay, which depends upon
                        illustration, but it also reflects the lack of attention paid to composite
                        art by most of the other authors, John Beer aside. Thompson, Glen, and
                        Butter do not discuss it at all; nor do Kittel and Ferguson, though their
                        arguments do not as obviously suggest that they ought to do so. I do not
                        mean to assert that this emphasis away from design is any kind of fault, for
                        it will always be appropriate for some essays to concentrate on <hi rend="i">aspects</hi> of Blake’s work. But it may be significant in view
                        of the declared ambitions of the anthology (objective articulation without
                        imposition) that the visual side of the composite design is so often elided.
                        Conviction is often easier to come by when one considers the text alone; the
                            <hi rend="i">relation</hi> of text to design often sets up reflections
                        which are less stable, and not verifiable in the conventional ways. In many
                        cases, in this act of relation, there seem to be no obvious
                        "influences." It thus becomes hard to "read" it without
                        confronting the more indeterminate aspects of Blake’s aesthetic.</p>
          <p>Even in the realm of the verbal, intrinsically considered, it may be a
                        peculiar justice that "mark" emerges as in many ways the fugal
                        word of the book. The variant readings offered by Thompson, Glen, and Beer
                        would serve as a means of articulating some of the questions generated by
                        the chosen title word, "Interpreting." I have found that
                        interpreting Blake is an activity calling for thought <hi rend="i">about</hi> interpretation. That element is built into Glen’s
                        essay, and into Beer’s. But I have the sense, perhaps unjustly, that
                        such a concern would be dismissed by some of the other authors as a piece of
                        fashionable nonsense. If so, then I am left wishing that British Blake might
                        set out to be a little less authoritarian, and perhaps thereby start to
                        explore the evidence for the <hi rend="i">historicality</hi> of the various
                        aesthetic indeterminacies in Blake’s work. Meanwhile, some mark with
                        the eye, some through it, and some with red pens.</p>

          <p>In February 1829, after ten years as an Associate, John Constable was elected
                        to full membership in the Royal Academy by a margin of one vote. Other
                        reasons besides the narrowness of his election made it difficult for him to
                        enjoy the recognition that it officially conferred. He had lost his beloved
                        wife Maria a few months before, and his painting was popular neither with
                        critics nor collectors. Still smarting from his election seven months after
                        it, Constable planned a series of prints that would summarize, diffuse, and
                        defend the principles of his art. He hired an engraver, David Lucas, to
                        render in mezzotint several of his paintings and sketches. Lucas submitted
                        his proofs to Constable and revised his steel plates according to the
                        latter’s corrections, heightening and dramatizing the effects of
                        natural light. The series appeared from June 1830 to July 1832 (four issues
                        of four prints, and a fifth of six) under the title <hi rend="i">Various
                            Subjects of Landscape, Characteristic of English Scenery, From Pictures
                            Painted by John Constable, R. A.</hi> Although—or perhaps
                        because—the project, which he financed himself, was not a great
                        success, Constable published a second edition of the series in 1833, this
                        time with an expanded commentary and a new title, <hi rend="i">Various
                            subjects of Landscape, characteristic of English Scenery, principally
                            intended to mark the Phenomena of the Chiar’oscuro of
                            Nature.</hi></p>
          <p>All twenty-two mezzotints, along with eighteen other prints from the
                        Constable-Lucas collaboration, have been reproduced after forty years of
                        scholarly neglect in <hi rend="i">Constable’s</hi> "<hi rend="i">English Landscape Scenery</hi>" by Andrew Wilton, who carefully
                        catalogues them and details their history and dates of issue. Mr. Wilton has
                        performed a valuable service, though one more valuable than he evidently
                        knows. His prefatory essay is strangely lacking in reasons why this little
                        known part of Constable’s work should be better known. Mr. Wilton
                        only finds in the prints further evidence of that "freedom from
                        mannerism, from preconceptions derived from the work of other artists"
                        that Constable’s work is traditionally supposed to demonstrate. Even
                        on its own sweepingly general terms, this commonplace can scarcely be
                        maintained. E. H. Gombrich has shown the considerable extent to which
                        Constable did work from preconceptions, and the Bicentenary Exhibition at
                        the Tate Gallery in 1976 amply demonstrated Constable’s debt to the
                        work of Claude, Gainsborough, Wilson, Girtin, Cozens, and even Turner. It is
                        not <hi rend="i">nature</hi> that determines the composition of
                        Constable’s work, so much as <hi rend="i">naturalism</hi>, that is,
                        an artistic rhetoric meant to convey the effect of nature. It is
                        particularly inappropriate to extol Constable’s freedom from
                        mannerism in the context of these mannered mezzotints, where such a rhetoric
                        appears at its most theatrical.</p>
          <p>All that motivates Mr. Wilton’s resurrection of <hi rend="i">English
                            Landscape Scenery</hi> seems to be an ideal of scholarly thoroughness.
                        In fact, the work has far more interesting claims to our attention. Born of
                        Constable’s anxiety to secure public understanding and acceptance of
                        his art, the series marks a <pb id="p14-129" n="129"/> significant turning
                        point in his style, from the restrained naturalism of his early works to the
                        personal expressionism of his late ones. The shift, of course, is only the
                        most conspicuous version of a tension running throughout all
                        Constable’s work between objective representation and subjective
                        expression. Even the rhetorically restrained work of his early period makes
                        covert allusions to private reminiscences (of his boyhood, his
                        father’s business, his courtship). In the bolder, reverse strategy
                        taken in <hi rend="i">English Landscape Scenery</hi>, Constable identifies
                        the overt personal expressionism of the prints with an utterly empirical
                        study of nature. As the change of title indicates, together with the changes
                        of design asked from Lucas, the key to this identification is
                        Constable’s conception of chiaroscuro. As he asserts in his 1833
                        introduction, chiaroscuro is both a natural and an artistic means for giving
                        landscape its expression. As a result, "the Chiar’oscuro of
                        Nature" permits Constable to equate nature’s moods with his own.
                        At the same time as the inky shadows and glittering highlights evoke the
                        dramatic effects of natural light, they also imply an equally dramatic
                        emotional response to them. (Both dramas, unfortunately, are lost in the
                        British Museum’s muzzy reproductions.)</p>
          <p>Chiaroscuro is thus Constable’s anxious way to seduce the
                        uncomprehending public into collaborating in the meaning and purpose of his
                        art. We participate at once in nature and in the emotional life of an artist
                        deeply moved by nature. If art historians have neglected <hi rend="i">English Landscape Scenery</hi>, the reason may be that the prints were
                        not executed by Constable himself. Yet insofar as they carry forward the
                        dramatic revelation of the uses of chiaroscuro, they are directly pertinent
                        to works that he did execute: those intensely tonal late masterpieces like
                        "The Valley Farm" (1835) that seem to aspire to no less than the
                        state of mezzotint.</p>

          <p>Two years Blake’s junior, an ambitious Mary Wollstonecraft arrived in
                        London in 1787 at the age of twenty-eight, seeking a living by her pen and
                        declaring in a letter to her sister, "I am going to be the first of a
                        new genus." Like Blake, Wollstonecraft was essentially self-educated.
                        She had survived a penurious childhood and the conventional and humiliating
                        employments of widow’s companion and governess. She had abducted a
                        sister from a bad marriage, organized a school for girls, participated in
                        Newington Green’s community of intellectual Dissenters which included
                        Richard Price, and attended the deathbeds of her mother and of a best friend
                        in Portugal. Having written <hi rend="i">Thoughts on the Education of
                            Daughters</hi> and <hi rend="i">Mary, a Fiction</hi>, both published by
                        Joseph Johnson, she meant to support herself—and a number of kin. She
                        was, she told Johnson, "not fond of grovelling."</p>
          <p>Working for Johnson first as translator and reader, later as reviewer and
                        editorial assistant for <hi rend="i">The Analytical Review</hi>,
                        Wollstonecraft continued <pb id="p14-130" n="130"/> to produce tracts: at
                        first moral, then—under the influence of the Johnson
                        circle—profoundly political. Her <hi rend="i">Original Stories from
                            Real Life</hi>, in which two girls are taught virtue and benevolence by
                        a stern but compassionate mother-figure, was illustrated by Blake in 1788,
                        and contained no revolutionary notions. In 1789 the Bastille fell, and all
                        was changed utterly. Price preached his sermon welcoming the revolution and
                        urging reform in England. Edmund Burke replied with the eloquently
                        conservative <hi rend="i">Reflections on the Revolution in France.</hi> And
                        Wollstonecraft excitedly wrote <hi rend="i">Vindication of the Rights of
                            Men</hi>, defending reason and liberty, attacking "the demon of
                        property," inherited privilege, and the hypocrisy of Burkean
                        sentiment—which could pity queens but not the hungry poor. In one
                        important digression, Wollstonecraft assails Burke’s opinion of
                        women. Another passage criticizes the "narrow circle" of the
                        wealthy family which loves only itself instead of all mankind (cf. Blake on
                        "soft family love" and "storgous appetite") and sells
                        its children into "legal prostitution." Johnson published the book
                        immediately in 1790, and it was widely reviewed. The argument extended in
                        1792 to the <hi rend="i">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</hi> brought
                        fame and notoriety; for Horace Walpole the author was "a hyena in
                        petticoats."</p>
          <p>Though ardent, impulsive, and thirsty for love, Wollstonecraft seems to have
                        had no affairs of the heart before 1791. In this year she became infatuated
                        with Fuseli, pursued him desperately in person and by letter, and proposed
                        to live with him and his wife. Rejected, she sailed for France. There ensued
                        the self-deluding, initially ecstatic and finally diastrous affair with
                        Gilbert Imlay, which resulted in a daughter, two suicide attempts, and an
                        offer—again rejected—to live with Imlay and his new mistress.
                        A tract on the French Revolution, and a book of travel letters, come from
                        this period. Wolstonecraft’s ultimate liaison and secret marriage
                        with Godwin ended in her death in 1797 after the birth of Mary Godwin, and
                        the shattering of her reputation when her widower fondly published her <hi rend="i">Posthumous Works</hi> including her love-letters to Imlay,
                        which he praised for their "sentiment and passion," and his <hi rend="i">Memoir</hi>, which told the tale of Fuseli as well as Imlay. A
                        torrent of abuse hailed down. A 1798 poem entitled <hi rend="i">The
                            Unsex’d Females</hi> depicts a licentious and voluptuous
                        Wollstonecraft. The <hi rend="i">Anti-Jacobin Review</hi> ridicules both
                        Godwins and calls <hi rend="i">The Rights of Woman</hi> "a scripture,
                        archly fram’d, for propagating whores." Its author had met, by
                        common consent, the death she deserved. If the Pickering "Mary" is
                        a tribute to Mary Wollstonecraft, born like Blake with "a different
                        face," it may owe as much to Blake’s horror at her critics as to
                        her actual character.</p>
          <p>The largest debt, if debt there be, of Blake to Wollstonecraft, is in <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>, whose heroine is
                        unique in romantic literature—and unique for Blake, since his later
                        heroines do not feel and think at the same time. Like Wollstonecraft,
                        Oothoon is heart <hi rend="i">and</hi> head. She is both assertively erotic
                        and brilliantly intellectual, generous of spirit yet smart enough to attack
                        patriarchy root and branch. Though the "story" of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> is not Wollstonecraft’s, her proposition to the
                        Fuselis (assuming these matters were gossipped about) might have made
                        Oothoon’s offer to fetch silver and gold girls for Theotormon seem
                        plausible. Moreover, the <hi rend="i">Vindication of the Rights of Man</hi>
                        may be linked to <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> by imagery and rhetoric as well
                        as ideology and the fact that we have a distinctly unladylike female
                        addressing a man who loves chivalry. "Why cannot estates be divided
                        into small farms?" Wollstonecraft asks Burke: <q> Why does the brown
                            waste meet the traveller’s view, when men want to work? . . . .
                            Why might not the industrious peasant be allowed to steal a farm from
                            the heath? . . . . how much misery lurks in pestilential corners . . .
                            how many mechanics, by a flux of trade or fashion, lose their employment
                            . . . . Where is the eye that marks these evils, more gigantic than any
                            of the infringements of property, which you piously deprecate? Let these
                            sorrows hide their diminished head before the tremendous mountain of woe
                            that thus defaces our globe! Man preys on man, and you mourn for the
                            idle tapestry that decorated a gothic pile, and the dronish bell that
                            summoned the fat priest to prayer. </q> From <hi rend="i">Vindication of
                            the Rights of Woman</hi>, Blake might, while ignoring its central
                        argument in favor of female independence, have been impressed by a woman who
                        could declare, "I . . . deny the existence of sexual virtues, not
                        excepting modesty" and "the modesty of women . . . will often be
                        only the artful veil of wantonness." The Blake of "London,"
                        "To the Accuser who is the God of This World" and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> would have approved Wollstonecraft’s sympathetic
                        treatment of prostitutes, and the fact that one of the two heroines in her
                        second novel, <hi rend="i">The Wrongs of Woman</hi>, is an ex-thief and
                        prostitute, while the other lives with the man she loves though married to a
                        brute, and assails the marriage laws in court. Blake would, I think (this is
                        my understanding of the major prophecies) have agreed with Wollstonecraft
                        that "from the tyranny of men . . . the greater number of female
                        follies proceed; and the cunning, which I allow makes at present a part of
                        their character . . . is produced by oppression." And if he read
                        Wollstonecraft on the French Revolution, he would surely have been
                        struck—as Janet Todd points out that John Adams and Percy Bysshe
                        Shelley were—by its idea of mental evolution ("the image of God
                        implanted in our nature is now more rapidly expanding"), her
                        dialectical view of history and politics, and her ability both to deplore
                        and to analyze the causes of revolutionary violence.</p>
          <p>Todd’s <hi rend="i">Wollstonecraft Anthology</hi> performs the
                        valuable service of making selections available from all the author’s
                        works, some of which exist in print only in expensive facsimile editions.
                        The general introduction gives a good synopsis of Wollstonecraft’s
                        life, writing, and reputation, stressing the development of her thought from
                        rationalism to radicalism, and seeing her life essentially as a
                        "struggle" against her own social conditioning. Blakeans may be
                        interested in this point, though Blake’s personal struggle with
                        Reason is archetypically male, while Wollstonecraft’s with Passion is
                        archetypically female.</p>
          <pb id="p14-131" n="131"/>
          <p>The headnotes to individual selections in this volume place them in the
                        context of their genres, and the selections themselves are ample,
                        illustrating the variety of the writer’s styles and concerns. I
                        personally would have enjoyed seeing fewer of the not-immensely-original
                        "Thoughts on the Education of Daughters" and the uniformly
                        disdainful reviews of novels by women Wollstonecraft thought were idiots. I
                        would have liked more of <hi rend="i">The Wrongs of Woman</hi> and some of
                        the early letters to friends and family as well as the letters to Imlay and
                        Godwin, and perhaps one of the <hi rend="i">Vindications</hi> in full. On
                        the other hand, the decision to give a large sampling of hard-to-find
                        material makes sense. All in all, this will be a highly useful book.</p>

          <p>When Damon’s <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi> was published in 1965 almost
                        all scholars recognized it as an indispensable companion to Blake studies.
                        It was handsomely printed in large clear type and thus quite expensive. Not
                        many who acquired the first printing also got the slightly revised and
                        amplified second printing in 1967, which Brown University Press has
                        commendably kept in print. In 1971 Dutton brought out a small paperback
                        edition of the 1965 printing with severely reduced print and narrowed
                        margins—presumably because Brown University Press wished to reserve
                        the small improvements of the 1967 printing (chiefly articles on EVERLASTING
                        GOSPEL, INNOCENCE AND EXPERIENCE, and LAVATER). The Dutton edition went out
                        of print some years ago. Now Shambhala has reissued the 1965 version in the
                        same small print as the Dutton reprint but with more generous margins and
                        also an excellent index (pp. 463-532) by Morris Eaves. May Damon’s
                        great work of scholarship, thus helpfully embellished, long remain available
                        at a moderate price.</p>
          <p>It may not be obvious why a "dictionary" should need an index,
                        especially since the interconnected entries are usually cross-referenced.
                        But Damon’s <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi> is practically an
                        encyclopedia of the subjects indicated in the subtitle, and anyone who
                        consults the <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi> needs to be able to skim over its
                        entries without turning every page, for one symbol leads into another beyond
                        the cross-references given under any one entry. Only after running through
                        Eaves’s index can one answer the elementary pre-publication question:
                        "Have you checked Damon’s <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi>?" (I
                        did notice an important unindexed mention of Joseph of Arimathea on p. 136;
                        this is fair warning that one must also consult Erdman’s <hi rend="i">Concordance.</hi>)</p>
          <p>Damon was a great scholar because he had read deeply in all the authors Blake
                        himself read and also in more recent authors like Melville and Joyce that
                        Blake would have cared for had he lived long enough. Gossip used to
                        represent Damon as a mystagoge, but nobody who conversed with him thought of
                        him as a crank, even though some of his students admitted they
                        couldn’t work up an interest in subjects he knew deeply. During the
                        meetings I had with him late in his life, Damon was a wonderful <pb id="p14-132" n="132"/> guide and companion, speaking clearly on abstruse
                        subjects and exhibiting a love of life such as many are not capable of, at
                        least in this culture. To be sure, it was not easy to argue a point with
                        him, but this was evidently due to his having become hard of hearing, rather
                        than to a dogmatic or authoritative cast of mind. It must be admitted that
                        nobody could persuade Damon that the evidence for Shelley’s being THE
                        BARD OF OXFORD (<hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi>, pp. 314-15; also eight other
                        references in the index) is weak, but he was also able to recognize the
                        complicating evidence of a letter to Hayley in which Blake had referred to
                        the insignificant Edward Marsh as "the Bard of Oxford." Damon
                        correctly felt that Marsh lacked the stature for the poetic role in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> But in order for Blake to have had any chance
                        of being aware of Shelley, Damon had to imagine <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                        45 [40]: 30 being first issued as late as 1822. Meanwhile early copies of
                            <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> required a Bard of Oxford fit to be
                        entrusted with the leaves of the Tree of Life. What cannot be denied by any
                        lover of Blake is that, if the Bard of Oxford must be imagined as some
                        actual person known to history, Shelley would have fitted the bill and Marsh
                        would not. This is Damon’s essential point and as such the proposed
                        identification fosters rather than contradicts true scholarship.</p>
          <p>The hostile reviewer in <hi rend="i">TLS</hi> 2 September 1965, p. 756,
                        complained that Damon’s Freudian views "seem
                        old-fashioned." Considering the current flood tide of books, articles,
                        and remarks concerning Blake and Freud, Damon’s outlook, has, on the
                        contrary, proven to be prophetic. Neither Blake, Freud, nor Damon can, of
                        course, be held responsible for the sexual politics causing this
                        overproduction. A more specific challenge by the <hi rend="i">TLS</hi>
                        reviewer better identifies a weakness in Damon’s method. Noting that
                        Damon’s expository manner is simply affirmative rather than
                        suggestive, she pointed out that in the awesome picture on <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 41 [46] the formidable flaming chariot—composed
                        of coiled serpents in which are seated an aged couple drawn by humanized
                        leonine bulls against a background of flames—is too flatly identified
                        as a version of Elijah’s fiery chariot (art. ELIJAH, p.
                        118—thanks to Eaves’s index). Indeed, she declared, without
                        counter-evidence, that there is no connection whatever with Elijah’s
                        chariot. She must have persuaded Erdman, who does not mention
                        Elijah’s chariot in <hi rend="i">The Illuminated Blake</hi>, pp.
                        320-21. In this case the redesignation of the color print now called <hi rend="i">God Judging Adam</hi> (formerly <hi rend="i">Elijah in the
                            Fiery Chariot</hi>) has complicated the problem of identifying all the
                        meaningful elements in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 41 [46]. Briefly, the
                        chariot remains either that of Elijah or of "God" even when its
                        vehicular power is supplied by Assyrian-descended bulls and great serpents
                        related to the ones ridden by children in <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> 6 and <hi rend="i">America</hi> 11. But in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 41 [46] the
                        context has become pessimistic and parodistic so that the aged couple are
                        carried along whither the supervising eagle-spirits (related to Los) would
                        have them go. Though Blake’s images change somewhat in the last
                        chapter of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, the reader approaching them on the
                        Fiery Chariot of his Contemplative Thought will recognize that the aged
                        couple must take control again to be transported and transfigured.</p>
          <p>What Damon actually tells us leaves out too many of the refinements and
                        conditionals in this picture. But it is surprising how often he was able to
                        justify the concision of his confident expository manner. Because Blake is
                        normally not mystifying and only complicated according to principles mostly
                        made clear in Damon’s first book, Blake’s ideas and symbols
                        can usually be coherently explained. Damon did not pretend to say the last
                        word about any subject, and few readers will have the impression that he was
                        condescending to them or attempting to lead them around by the nose.</p>
          <p>The best way to assess the continued usefulness of Damon’s <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi> is to follow it in action. As a research tool,
                        it seems never to lose its freshness. Recently I noticed that Bentley, <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Writings</hi> I, 14, glossed the
                        concluding aphorism of <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi>,
                        "God becomes as we are that we may be as he is," with a remarkably
                        apposite quotation from Irenaeus’s <hi rend="i">Five Books Against
                            Heresies</hi>, which Bo Lindberg, <hi rend="i">William Blake’s
                            Illustrations to the Book of Job</hi> (1973), p. 38, also cited in Latin
                        only. In checking the <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi> (p. 402), I found that
                        Damon had chosen to quote Athanasius: "He indeed assumed humanity that
                        we might become God," though he also gives references to Irenaeus (Book
                        III, not Book V, which was preferred by Lindberg and Bentley) and Calvin.
                        Damon’s conclusion, however, concentrates on the difference that
                        keeps Blake’s use of traditional ideas from ever seeming commonplace:
                        "Whereas the theologians all use the past tense, as of an historical
                        event, Blake uses the present tense, for the act is eternal and is always
                        going on." Often the real force of Blake’s ideas can be
                        recognized neither by those of Eliot’s persuasion who suppose that
                        Blake had no tradition nor by those of Raine’s persuasion who suppose
                        that all Blake’s ideas were already in the Perennial Philosophy.
                        Damon is usually right in spirit because he could see the element of truth
                        in both these schools.</p>
          <p>Damon used to insist on the spelling "Tyger" whenever one referred
                        to Blake’s creation: I remember his checking my convictions about
                        this matter before he could relax and speak joyfully about Blake and the
                        other visionaries such as Dante and Dostoevsky (cf. p. 410 re. THE TREE).
                        Curiously, Damon was less scrupulous in referring to design 10 for
                        Dante’s <hi rend="i">Comedy</hi> by the Victorian title, "The
                        Circle of the Lustful" (p. 97)—a traditional solecism that
                        negates Blake’s own (reversed) inscription. The only appropriate
                        title for the greatest of pictorial ideas ever related to this wonderful
                        episode is "The Whirlwind of Lovers." One can be confident that
                        Damon would have immediately corrected this anti-Blakean error if it had
                        been called to his attention, perhaps even troubling to explain why it is
                        misleading, as he did in the case of "Glad Day" (p. 14). Since the
                        old customarily wrong title falsifies Blake’s vision it is an error
                        in the usages of Blake scholarship that must forthwith be corrected.</p>
          <p>Let us suppose that we wanted to look up Blake’s idea of The Covering
                        Cherub. The long way would be to start with Erdman’s <hi rend="i">Concordance</hi>, but Damon’s <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi>, pp.
                        93-94, COVERING CHERUB, gives a good <pb id="p14-133" n="133"/> account of
                        the essence of this basic symbol, which has also been well discussed by
                        Frye, but few others. Unfortunately Damon neglected to cross-reference
                        CHERUBIM (p. 80) where the crucial early reference in <hi rend="i">The
                            Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> 14 is correctly identified so that one
                        can understand that this Cherub has a key place in all Blake’s
                        subsequent symbolism. If one had started at CHERUBIM Damon’s own
                        cross-reference to COVERING CHERUB would have sufficed, but no student would
                        ever hunt to find the fourteen other references given in the Eaves index.
                        (One of these, a reference to IEREUS (p. 194—i.e. <hi rend="i">priest</hi>—is incorrectly spelled "lereus" in the
                        index, p. 478). The Covering Cherub is two-faced and many-faceted. Naturally
                        the Covering Cherub flourishes in an age obsessed with problematics,
                        ambiguities, and anxieties. The most learned of Blake scholars, Sir Geoffrey
                        Keynes, to whom the <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi> was dedicated, even
                        professed to see the Covering Cherub where he is not, on the frontispiece of
                            <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience.</hi> Damon was a great critic because
                        he recognized the face of error and could uncover the difference between
                        what Blake was driving at and much else that can be thought and said about
                        the same thing.</p>
          <p>Damon’s method with pictures is simple and productive: his
                        thoroughness in matching the figures with words had rarely been equaled
                        except by Wicksteed and Roe. As a rule Damon refrained from translating
                        Blake’s pictorial symbolism into terms of Blake’s
                        "system"—the finding of Zoas and Emanations wherever men
                        and women were gathered together—at least when there is no call to do
                        so. For this reason, one can readily sort out truth from error in
                        Damon’s interpretations, whereas the cloudy equivocations of another
                        sort of critic are built on presumed ambiguities and thus are neither hot
                        nor cold.</p>
          <p>In my earlier review in <hi rend="i">Philological Quarterly</hi>, XLV(1966),
                        533-35 I praised Damon’s precision and also called attention to some
                        errors in the exegesis of major pictures, which are an important part of the
                            <hi rend="i">Dictionary.</hi> Damon reproduces and discusses ten major
                        pictures, starting with the greatest, as represented by the Rosenwald
                        drawing of the <hi rend="i">Last Judgment.</hi> For this picture he also
                        provides a shadow picture in which most of the fugures are numbered and
                        keyed, usually with appropriate passages from "A Vision of the Last
                        Judgment" as given in the Keynes text. Among the errors to be noted are
                        that Damon called group 71 Hagar and Ishmael, but they are certainly Sarah
                        and Isaac; the other pair are an unnumbered group between 64, The Church
                        Universal, and 70, Abraham. This error and part of Blake’s
                        description of the lost tempera, which must have differed from the drawing,
                        led Damon to identify the winged and bearded record keeper below them as
                        Mohammed. This is a major error, for the figure accords clearly with
                        Blake’s own description (which follows directly after that for 64,
                        the Church Universal): "The Aged Figure with Wings, having a writing
                        tablet and taking account of the numbers who arise, is That Angel of the
                        Divine Presence mentioned in Exodus XIVC., 19 v. and in other Places; this
                        Angel is frequently called by the Name of Jehovah Elohim, The ‘I
                        am’ of the Oaks of Albion" (<hi rend="i">N</hi> pp. 80-81, K
                        610). Damon must have realized that the Angel of the Divine Presence had to
                        be somewhere so he put him in at the upper right as number 12; unfortunately
                        this is a <hi rend="i">pair</hi> of kneeling figures associated with the
                        Communion above the clouds where damnation begins to operate. I am sorry to
                        say that this severe dislocation of Blake’s master design went
                        unremarked at the MLA meeting devoted to the <hi rend="i">Last Judgment</hi>
                        some years ago. All of us who were there seem to have had our minds on other
                        matters that Damon had handled with ease. I must add, however, that
                        Damon’s article on THE ANGEL OF DIVINE PRESENCE, p. 23, is concise
                        and suggestive.</p>
          <p>A word of caution for anyone who sets out to correct Damon’s <hi rend="i">Last Judgment</hi>: the picture in the <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi> is fairly clear but in the Shambhala format it is so
                        much reduced that one must use a magnifying glass. Even in the more elegant
                        treatment of the Brown University Press edition where the shadow picture and
                        key fold out and face the reproduction, not enough is visible for certainty.
                        Much preferable is the reproduction in Keynes’ <hi rend="i">Pencil
                            Drawings</hi>: Second Series (1956), pl. 27, or Keynes’s 1970
                        Dover edition of the <hi rend="i">Drawings</hi>, illus. 51; both, though
                        considerably reduced, are a good deal clearer. Though we must lament the
                        loss of the great tempera of the Last Judgment, we ought to realize just how
                        good the Rosenwald drawing is in its own right, not just as an indication of
                        what is lost. Roe’s description is entirely justified: "A great
                        masterpiece of design and linear draftsmanship, with an amazing feeling for
                        delicate and swift movement which weaves through the wonderfully organized
                        multitude of figures, preserving complete clarity amidst complexity, this
                        drawing ranks as one of the outstanding achievements of Blake’s
                        life" (A. S. Roe, "A Drawing of the Last Judgment," <hi rend="i">Huntington Library Quarterly</hi>, 21 [1957], 40; reprinted in
                        R. N. Essick, ed., <hi rend="i">The Visionary Hand</hi>, 1973, p. 205).</p>
          <p>Elsewhere, often in this journal, I have written at some length on five other
                        pictures reproduced in the <hi rend="i">Dictionary.</hi> In every case I
                        have profited from Damon’s observations, yet I have usually had to
                        disagree with or refine some aspect of his basic interpretations. As regards
                        the central figure in the Spenser cavalcade, for example, I show that she is
                        undoubtedly Britomart, not Amoret, as Damon had proposed (see <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi>, illus. VIII and p. 384, vs. Grant-Brown in <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi> 31, 8 [Winter 1974-75], 66-67). And in
                        the Arlington Court Picture, referred to by Damon as "The Circle of
                        Life," I have argued that the figures at the center must be Los and
                        Jerusalem, not Luvah and Vala (see <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi>, illus. IV
                        and p. 87, vs. Grant in <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi> 11, 3 [May 1970],
                        98 and 13, 4 [August 1970], 17-18; also <hi rend="i">Studies in
                            Romanticism</hi> 10 [1971], 21-26—repr. <hi rend="i">The
                            Visionary Hand</hi>, pp. 483-91). As for my discussions of the designs
                        for <hi rend="i">L’ Allegro</hi> and <hi rend="i">Il Penseroso</hi>,
                        two of which Damon reproduces, which appeared in <hi rend="i">Blake
                            Newsletter</hi> 16, 4[1971], 117-34, repr. <hi rend="i">The Visionary
                            Hand</hi>, pp. 418-48, and <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi> 19, 5
                        [1971-72], 190-202—Eaves’s index shows me that my note
                        references to passages in the <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi> were incomplete,
                        but that luckily what I had over-looked does not affect my understanding of
                        Damon’s position. In his article on PLATO Damon saw well enough that
                        in <hi rend="i">Il Penseroso</hi> 9, "Milton and the Spirit <pb id="p14-134" n="134"/> of Plato" (illus. IX and pp. 327-28), Blake
                        was attacking Plato, not defending him, as Raine had wished to suppose. Yet
                        Damon remained enough affected by the Platonizers to declare that Plato was
                        Blake’s "former idol," whereas he should have said Blake
                        had never been a Platonist.</p>
          <p>In my <hi rend="i">Philological Quarterly</hi> review of the <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi> I complained of Damon’s identification of the
                        male figure who stands on the curve of the earth and receives a schroll from
                        Jesus in the <hi rend="i">second</hi> version of the Genesis title page as
                        the Holy Ghost. As a caption for the picture, illustration II, Damon refers
                        to the article ZOA, p. 459, but the discussion in the article GENESIS, p.
                        151, is more informative, indicating also that Damon had confused the first
                        and second versions of the title page. The additional five references
                        identified in Eaves’s index do not make the theory more persuasive
                        that the receiver of the scroll should be identified as the Holy Spirit.</p>
          <p>Curiously, Damon neglected to mention the third divine figure in the heavenly
                        regions who is represented as rushing with outspread wings above the top of
                        the picture, thus appearing in a position of superiority both to the Son on
                        the left and the Father on the right. While the body of this superior figure
                        is quite distinct, his actions and circumstances are only sketchily
                        indicated. First we must recognize that the Father (with his
                        compasses—not a bow, as I had asserted—held at his side) who
                        stands in a mandorla above the Tree of Life, is dividing the waters above
                        the firmament from those below. It is an extension of the supernal waters
                        that the superior spirit is rushing across as, with outstretched arms, he
                        wields a gigantic bow-shaped object that arcs around him and even over the
                        horizontal line sketched across the top to indicate the planned limit of the
                        picture.</p>
          <p>The figure himself is a direct quotation (reversed) from <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> 3 and <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> 3—as noted in
                        Erdman’s <hi rend="i">The Illuminated Blake</hi>—but in the
                        final context he is freed from the flames that variously crippled the
                        attempts of both Orc and Los to resist the devastating hegemony of Urizen.
                        The sketched bow-shaped object he deploys is perhaps best understood as a
                        more regular version of the involved scroll that curves around the genial
                        self-image Blake drew in the Upcott autograph book on 26 January 1826. From
                        the directing right wing of the Holy Spirit descend two continuations of
                        this scroll: they blend into the second letter of the "Genesis"
                        title and thence pervade the whole word, being also passed on below in the
                        smaller scroll from Jesus to regenerate man who has arisen above the curve
                        of the Earth and even the sphere of air to receive it. The wings and
                        position of the originating figure alone show that in the end (on paper
                        watermarked 1826) Blake wanted to depict the Holy Spirit not as a bird (as
                        he had done as recently as the <hi rend="i">Last Judgment</hi>, and
                        elsewhere)—and certainly not as a vacuum—but as a virile man
                        with the power to disseminate the spirit of prophecy.</p>
          <p>Damon tried to draw some of these implications out of the fourth figure who
                        stands on the curve of the earth wearing as a loincloth the phallic letter
                        "I" of the title, but his position as the receptor of a scroll
                        from Jesus shows that he is human, not a Spirit. He is, to be sure, a
                        glorified human who wears a large plate halo, which is perhaps the Sun
                        itself, as he reaches up to receive the scroll from the Son while drawing
                        sustenance with his outspread left hand from the mandorla of the Father. I
                        am convinced, though I cannot prove it, that the scroll must contain the
                        Everlasting Gospel, which was promised to regenerate man in the Book of
                        Revelation and partly written out in Blake’s own Notebook. The new
                        Adam who receives it is the energetic embodiment of Albion who has arisen
                        and, after his dance, is fit to return to paradise, to make a human fourth
                        with the three persons of the Trinity. His posture is nearly identical with
                        that of the giant man who reaches up in <hi rend="i">The Angel of
                            Revelation</hi> and declares "that there should be time no
                        longer."</p>
          <p>In the first version of the Genesis title page (watermarked 1821) there are
                        many different ideas and symbols which Blake refined and also altered in the
                        second version. Here three of the Four Zoas at the bottom also raise their
                        arms, thus echoing the gesture of the central man, while the fourth, though
                        bound, looks inward to witness the transfer of wisdom. But in the final
                        version the Four Zoas appear in animal forms and only one, a dishumanized
                        serpentine man, raises his (left) arm toward the Tree of Death, which is
                        added in this later version. Here it appears that even Los as the Eagle can
                        sight with only one eye the redemptive transmission of the Everlasting
                        Gospel, which in the last day can tell unobfuscated truth. These bestial
                        Four Zoas appear still bathing their feet in the waters outside of Eden, but
                        the flames that play over their figures in the earlier version of the title
                        page are no longer shown. The spectator is to infer that until after all the
                        Zoas have bathed in the other waters, the waters of life evident above the
                        firmament, the Zoas constitute bestial impersonations of the Covering
                        Cherub, as yet unable to find their places within the bosom of Albion.</p>
          <p>Still, the story of "Genesis" that Blake wished at last to show
                        correctly must have been that of paradise regained rather than of paradise
                        still lost. It will be interesting to see whether the edition of the Genesis
                        manuscript that has been promised for some time by the American Blake
                        Foundation has been conceived so as to reveal the extent of Blake’s
                        purposes in this project of the wonderful last year of his life. If so,
                        correct understanding will have grown out of the leads Damon left us by
                        calling attention to what is important and, what is even rarer, in
                        communicating the right spirit of interpretation even when details, even
                        major details, of the interpretation offered were inaccurate. Because
                        Damon’s imagination was always in the right place, the need for his
                            <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi> will continue to be felt by every Blake
                        scholar. With Eaves’s assistance in locating all Damon had to say, we
                        cannot envision a time when it will be possible to get along without the <hi rend="i">Dictionary.</hi><ref target="p134u1" type="note">*</ref><note id="p134u1">* Evidently my concluding and opening exhortations do not
                            quite express a consensus. Michael J. Tolley, for one, does not agree.
                            He calls my attention to his review of Damon’s <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi> in <hi rend="i">Southern Review</hi> (Australia) 2
                            (1967), esp. 271-74, which showed in detail that Damon was often wrong
                            about Blake’s understanding of the Bible. Perhaps the number of
                            scholars who, like Tolley, can forego use of the <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi> is larger than I have supposed. Still, I can think
                            of few books or articles published during the last fifteen years that
                            would not have been better if the elementary pre-publication question I
                            ask in my second paragraph could really he answered
                            "yes."</note></p>

          <p>Maureen Quilligan’s <hi rend="i">The Language of Allegory</hi> nowhere
                        mentions Blake, yet it should prove highly rewarding to those students
                        interested in Blake’s verbal art, and particularly to those pursuing
                        his murky distinction between "vision" and "allegory"
                            (<hi rend="i">VLJ</hi>, E 544).</p>
          <p>Quilligan’s thesis is that the defining characteristic of
                        non-mechanical allegories—what links them into a genre—is
                        "their very particular emphasis on language as their first focus and
                        ultimate subject" (p. 15), and her book unfolds the consequences and
                        operations of that focus through a theoretical framework (the book moves
                        from sections on "The Text" to "The Pretext," "The
                        Context," and "The Reader") larded with discussions of
                        "allegories" as diverse as <hi rend="i">Piers Plowman</hi>,
                        Melville’s <hi rend="i">The Confidence Man</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The
                            Crying of Lot 49.</hi> For Quilligan, the kind of language which is the
                        subject (and object) of allegory displays three interrelated features: it is
                        polysemous, non-arbitrary, and—striking to read in a work of
                        contemporary literary criticism—it asks for a reader "willing to
                        entertain the possibility of making a religious response to the ineffability
                        invoked by [allegory’s] polysemous language" (p. 223).</p>
          <p>Emphasizing "the possibility of an otherness, a polysemy, inherent in
                        the very words of the page," Quilligan proposes to reorient the idea of
                        allegory "away from out traditional insistence on allegory’s
                        distinction between word said and meaning meant, to the simultaneity of the
                        process of signifying multiple meaning" (p. 26). The allegory can then
                        be seen as a kind of extended pun, generating its narrative out of wordplay,
                        unfolding "as a series of punning commentaries, related to one another
                        on the most literal of verbal levels—the sounds of words" (p.
                        22; though here one must query, why not the graphic shapes of words as well?
                        sound is not the most literally <hi rend="i">literal</hi> of verbal levels).
                        A Blakean example might be "Of the primeval Priests assum’d
                        power" (<hi rend="i">BU</hi> 2.1), where you must wonder about prim and
                        proper evil priests and then the power they assumed or that you assume they
                        have—fit questions to open the book of your reason (among other
                        possibilities). Such a text—manifesting Quilligan’s suggestion
                        regarding the function of wordplay in allegory—addresses the
                        reader’s production of meaning and forces him "to become
                        self-conscious of his own reading" (pp. 21, 41). The end result of this
                        dynamic is to make the reader aware of his or her own interpretative acts,
                        to force the reader to reflect on how the text has been read, and in
                        reflecting on this operation to realize the choices he or she has made about
                        the text and, finally, the kinds of choices the reader makes in life (p.
                        253). The effect of the confused "Argument" (which means, <pb id="p14-136" n="136"/> "literally," "to make clear")
                        of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> perhaps offers an
                        oblique example for Quilligan’s contention that "the effect of
                        wordplay is to make the reader self-conscious of reading by indicating the
                        primary importance of the verbal surface rather than the imagined action.
                        The narrative’s self-reflexiveness to its own verbal medium (not to
                        its action) by decentering the reader’s interest, unsettles the
                        focus, so the reader becomes more conscious of his own production of
                        meaning" (p. 254). "Rintrah roars &amp; shakes his fires in the
                        burdend air" seems as much about verbal (and graphic) media as about
                        any imagined action.</p>
          <p>The two remaining defining features of the language of allegory are expressed
                        in the contention that <q> Allegories are not only always texts, predicated
                            on the existence of other previous, sacred texts, they are always
                            fundamentally about language and the ways in which language itself can
                            reveal to man his highest spiritual purpose within the cosmos. As such,
                            allegory always presupposes at least a potential sacralizing power in
                            language, and it is possible to write and to read allegory intelligently
                            only in those cultural contexts which grant to language a significance
                            beyond that belonging to a merely arbitrary system of signs. Allegory
                            will not exist as a viable genre without this "suprarealist"
                            attitude toward words; that is, its existence assumes an attitude in
                            which abstract nouns not only name universals that are real, but in
                            which the abstract names themselves are preceived to be as real and as
                            powerful as the things named. Language itself must be felt to have a
                            potency as solidly meaningful as physical fact before the allegorist can
                            begin; out of its magic phenomenality—out of language sensed in
                            terms of a nearly physical presence—the allegorist’s
                            narrative comes, peopled by words moving about an intricately reechoing
                            landscape of language. (p. 156) </q> Quilligan’s belief that
                        "Allegory calls attention to the other—in a word, to God, or to
                        some sort of possible sacredness" should be related to her argument
                        that the Bible is the necessary "pretext": "All allegories
                        incorporate the Bible into their texts . . . and its problematic
                        incorporation into the text becomes therefore a defining characteristic of
                        the genre" (p. 96). I confess some puzzlement here—it is as
                        though Quilligan wishes to characterize allegories as
                        "logocentric" exercises, deferring to "the word,"
                        "scripture," "the book," but chooses instead to localize
                        those signifieds as the Bible. This formulation is one of several that
                        cannot easily be applied to Blake, despite his belief in the Eternal Vision
                        contained in the Bible. Milton, Shakespeare, Paracelsus &amp; Behmen, the
                        American and French Revolutions are equally among Blake’s informing
                        pretexts; and these in turn are equally manifestations of imagination, the
                        pretext (or, preludium) of an imminent and immanent sacred power. Besides,
                        Blake’s early statement about creating a "Bible of Hell,"
                        and his later assertion that "that God from whom [all books are
                        given]" is again speaking through him, suggests that not the Bible
                        only, but all works of imagination are privileged. Quilligan herself seems
                        to admit this wider scope of allegory, recognizing that "since
                        allegories take as their province all the wisdom stored in the repository of
                        man’s language, they, of necessity, tend to an encyclopedic
                        sprawl" (p. 141).</p>
          <p>Quilligan’s remark concerning "those cultural contexts"
                        necessary for the intelligent reading and writing of allegory is also
                        unsatisfyingly vague. She refers to "those periods when language is
                        felt to be a numinous object" (p. 281); furthermore, allegory attempts
                        to place the reader in relation to self and to society as a whole
                        ("which is considered as well to be part of a cosmic play"), and
                        "this whole process relies on a public acceptance of the polysemous
                        potency of language to connect these (now, to us, disparate) realms"
                        (p. 192). This feels true as far as it goes, but one is driven to wonder:
                        when were those periods? what is the psycho-social-economic-spiritual matrix
                        behind the context she posits? Nineteenth-century New England was evidently
                        one of the periods—judging by the presence of examples from
                        Hawthorne, Emerson, and Melville (but who was reading <hi rend="i">The
                            Confidence Man</hi> "intelligently" when it was published?)
                        Examples from Nabokov and Pynchon, and quotations from Foucault suggest that
                        we are again entering one of the periods. Medieval and Renaissance England
                        of course. The correspondences get difficult to see. Obviously, the one
                        glaring example (since it offers no sample of real allegory) of an <hi rend="i">un</hi>privileged period is eighteenth-century and romantic
                        English literature. Given "the essential affinity of allegory to the
                        pivotal phenomenon of the pun" (p. 33), that period’s strictures
                        on the pun manifest its rejection of allegory. For Quilligan, that wide body
                        of literature serves only to make a negative point: "After Pope,
                        poetry’s main value lies in the intricate process by which words
                        uncreate darkness, bringing up from private recesses the previously
                        unacknowledged fundament of human experience. The privacy of the romantic
                        lyric, its devaluation of didactic purpose, along with the often-stated
                        romantic distaste for a mechanically conceived allegory, reveal what might,
                        in another context, be unlikely to be perceived as a generic fact about
                        allegory—that its purpose is always public, at the least,
                        ‘national’" (p. 191). Whatever else may be objected, one
                        sees vividly the liability of generalizing without taking account of the
                        Blakean particular (<hi rend="i">M</hi> 1, "Public Address," <hi rend="i">inter alia</hi>).</p>
          <p>Indeed, the issues raised by Blake’s "Sublime Allegory"
                        (letter, 7 July 1803) are, so to speak, <hi rend="i">isomorphous</hi> with
                        the questions suggested but not answered by Quilligan’s provocative
                        book. Or perhaps simply—although it manages to embrace <hi rend="i">The Crying of Lot 49</hi>—Quilligan’s conception of
                        allegory would not include Blake; for all its emphasis on
                        "polysemy" Quilligan’s book seems to involve a conception
                        of the text curiously closed to "dissemination"<ref target="n5" type="note">1</ref> and even poetry (after Spenser). Quilligan notes
                        "allegory’s characteristic concern for process," which
                        "can be spoken of only in terms of . . . language" (p. 221), yet
                        her reader feels in the end that despite the invocation of "the
                        sacred," "language" is just another name for process to
                        facilitate the academic concern for defining a genre. <pb id="p14-137" n="137"/> She says that her interpretation "suggests that allegory
                        goes beyond mere literary categories" and that "The approach to
                        allegory I have been describing attempts to show how each work provides a
                        conscious portrait of the reader in the act of reading" (p. 241).
                        Portrait for whom? is the text merely a profound mirror in which the reader
                        sees his or her manipulations of the text? Or, what seems closer to the
                        almost mystical, unspoken vision of the book (and closer also to Blake), is
                        the "portrait" itself "conscious," taking its life as
                        "a Representation of what Eternally Exists. Really &amp;
                        Unchangeably" (<hi rend="i">VLJ</hi>, E 544). For Blake, of course,
                        this is a description of "Vision &amp; Imagination" as opposed to
                        "Fable or Allegory . . . a totally distinct &amp; inferior kind of
                        poetry." But it strikes this reviewer that Quilligan has in part
                        written about just such Vision, seen as "concern for process, for the
                        complicated exfoliation of interdependent psychic, intellectual, and
                        cultural revelations, which can all be spoken of only in terms of the force
                        that shapes them all: language" (p. 221). Ultimately, however,
                        "Process," "langauge"—"going forth &amp;
                        returning wearied," "the Words of Eternity"—seem in
                        Quilligan’s conception to be separate from some pre-existing
                        "sacred": the genre she is limiting is marked by "a truly
                        allegorical concern for a sacred pretext" (p. 284). The ambiguity of
                        the last quotation would be appreciated by the Devil of <hi rend="i">The
                            Marriage</hi>, for whom "All Bibles or sacred codes. have been the
                        causes of . . . Errors." For Blake, "language" itself,
                        "process" itself is sacred and holy, and the true perception of
                        such states, Vision: to defer with Quilligan to some earlier sacred is to
                        invoke "an allegorical abode where existence hath never come" (<hi rend="i">Eur</hi> 6.7). Read diabolically (allegorically?),
                        Quilligan’s book helps us to understand why "Allegory &amp;
                        Vision ought to be known as Two Distinct Things &amp; so called for the
                        Sake of Eternal Life." <note id="n5"><hi rend="s">1</hi> The word is
                            glossed by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak in the introduction to her
                            translation of Jacques Derrida, <hi rend="i">Of Grammatology</hi>:
                            " . . . Derrida offers this version of textuality: A sowing that
                            does not produce plants, but is simply infinitely repeated. A semination
                            that is not insemination but dissemination, seed spilled in vain, an
                            emission that cannot return to its origin in the father [i.e. author].
                            Not an exact and controlled polysemy, but a proliferation of always
                            different, always postponed meanings" (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins
                            University Press, 1976; p. lxv).</note></p>
          <p>Lest I leave the reader with the impression that Quilligan wanted to write on
                        Vision but ended up trying to define allegory, let me repeat that <hi rend="i">The Language of Allegory</hi> offers a great many inspired
                        moments and deserves close consideration by any reader interested, as all
                        readers of Blake must be, in "all-powerful Human Words!" (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 24.1). The last words here ought to be hers: <q> Perhaps
                            language cannot redeem language, so that poetry cannot redeem society;
                            fiction may only entertain. But all allegorists do aim at redemption;
                            and because they must work with language, they ultimately turn to the
                            paradox at the heart of their own assumptions about words and make the
                            final focus of their narratives not merely the social function of
                            language, but, in particular, the slippery tensions between literalness
                            and metaphor. They scrutinize language’s own problematic
                            polysemy. (p. 64) </q></p>

                        achievement as poem, and again it is an exemplary casebook for exploring the
                        complex relations of text and design in Blake’s work. Up to this
                        point teachers have had to rely on the indifferently reproduced
                        black-and-white redaction of copy G, the Rosenwald copy, edited by Clark
                        Emery for the University of Miami Press, or the reproduction of copy B in
                        Erdman’s <hi rend="i">Illuminated Blake</hi>, generally better in
                        printing but uneconomical for a class not concentrating on Blake. With a
                        strong library, of course, one can coordinate the energies, the clean
                        fingers, and no. 2 pencils of one’s students in a stampede on the
                        rare book room, where the Trianon facsimile of copy G merits an annual
                        dusting. None of these alternatives, however, can vie with a reasonably
                        priced and reasonably presented color reproduction of copy G, for which
                        there is a student, and (not to be discounted) a fair public, demand. To
                        have an edition backed by a major trade publisher heralds wide acceptance,
                        and one might accordingly anticipate wide applause. That is, I think,
                        unlikely. Unfortunately, the defects of this edition, which will undoubtedly
                        dismay purists, are such as to disturb even those who take long views and do
                        not foresee residence in Jerusalem next year or for the determinable future.
                        No aspect of the edition—the reproduction, the edited text, or the
                        commentary—escapes them. Since this review is intended for the
                        journal of record for Blake, I will tax the reader’s patience with a
                        specification of the problems that this edition poses for use in teaching,
                        scholarship, and (lest it be forgotten) one’s aesthetic experience of
                        an undeniable masterpiece.</p>
          <p>The Eassons’ decision to present us with yet another facsimile of copy
                        G is not to be disputed: this latest known complete copy, despite the
                        absence of Urizen’s soliloquy in the problematical plate 4, has come
                        to be thought of as the standard copy, for, unlike earlier copies
                        colorprinted in pastel, here Blake employs a richly layered watercoloring
                        and even the overlay of gold and silver leaf. Copy G is, quite simply, one
                        of the great triumphs of Blake’s art. It does not, however, appear
                        such in this edition. One’s first inclination is to waive minor
                        discrepancies in color, arguing that film technology is still unreliable
                        when it comes to absolute fidelity with four-color plates. This is, of
                        course, the justification for the laborious and expensive
                        collotype-and-stencil process undertaken by the Trianon Press series of
                        facsimiles. In the <pb id="p14-139" n="139"/> Shambala/Random House <hi rend="i">Book of Urizen</hi>, with color plates printed by Lehigh Press,
                        economy has prevailed over even a minimum standard of fidelity. To begin
                        with, as was noted previously in these pages with the like edition of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> copy B, glossy photographic paper insures a
                        flatness of effect in place of Blake’s subtle texturing. One might
                        imagine the editors protesting but having to acquiesce in such an economy,
                        but as fair trade they should have demanded a true color negative. There is
                        scarcely a plate in which significant departures from the original are not
                        manifest. In general, one may summarize them as a loss of layered texture
                        and a pronounced tendency toward primary hues, Blake’s subtle color,
                        especially in earth tones, being deepened into heavy reds and oranges. Even
                        a cursory glance through the colored plates here will reveal how dominated
                        they are by red. It is not altogether facetious, given this reproduction, to
                        suggest that Fuzon evacuated Egypt to escape the plague of measles ravaging
                        its inhabitants.</p>
          <p>For the purposes of this review, somewhat delayed by the death of Lessing J.
                        Rosenwald, I have compared the Easson reproduction closely with the Trianon
                        facsimile and with the original copy G, recently transferred from the
                        Alverthorpe Gallery to its permanent residence in the Library of Congress.
                        It should be noted from the start that Blake’s familiar siena, the
                        printing base for copy G, is transmuted more or less (the values change from
                        plate to plate) to a strident red.</p>
          <p>1. Title-page. A premonition of what is to follow is figured in the anomalous
                        change of the plate numeral "1" in the upper right from an
                        orangered to bright green. The sky in the upper right is changed from muted
                        blue to azure; indications of pale green vegetation above an otherwise
                        barren tree in the upper left are lost in blotches of orange over olive. A
                        similar swathe of pale green across the bottom is changed to olive.</p>
          <p>2. Preludium. Ugly red stipple disfigures the flesh of woman and child as
                        well as the central background: these are subtle flesh tones in the
                        original. The woman’s outlandish henna hair should be auburn. To her
                        upper right gray-blue sky adopts a greenish tinge toward the top: here all
                        is azure. The flame-like vegetation surrounding the text is a lovely spring
                        green in the original: here, olive-orange, it suggests only fire.</p>
          <p>3. Headpiece of youth racing through flames: in the original pen lines and
                        gold flecking give a textured sense of the body’s immersion in the
                        medium.</p>
          <p>4. Full-page design of crouched Urizen surrounded by rock. The splendid gold
                        flecks in the rock, of obvious iconographical significance, are lost here.
                        Gray-blue in upper left, consistent with rock, here looks like the intrusion
                        of sky. Urizen’s body is simply not rose-purple.</p>
          <p>5. Headpiece of haloed Urizen holding open book. Again, the loss of gold in
                        the halo and in the text of the book removes iconographical significance.
                        The very top should be wholly dark blue, not mostly black. The opaque black
                        blotch across the book is in the original a translucent shadow.</p>
          <p>6. Full-page design of Urizen in semi-cruciform position, immersed in water.
                        This is far from the original with all colors transmuted. Red on face and in
                        hair replaces subtle orange: Urizen’s eyes are not, as here, madly
                        blood-shot. Where there is white, read gray throughout; where electric blue,
                        a faint azure tint. Considerable overpainting with silver leaf (in water to
                        right of Urizen, on his right foot, right knee, and on his beard) and gold
                        (on nose, right big toe, and below him) is lost and with it the
                        three-dimensional sense of immersion.</p>
          <p>7. Three-quarters page design of three falling figures encoiled by serpents.
                        The basic background color of the medium through which they fall should be
                        green, not as here orange. Considerable gold flecking arching over the left
                        figure and accentuating the serpents is absent. The wonderful effect of a
                        scarlet overwash on gold leaf at the bottom is lost. (Incidentally, even the
                        Trianon facsimile erred here by inverting the overlay.) Again, the figures
                        have a blotchy red rather than the grayish flesh tone of the original.</p>
          <p>8. Full-page design of figure balanced on hands surrounded by rock-cloud
                        medium: as a whole much too bright and stark. Where Blake uses a gray or
                        pink-white this has simply white. Red striations are too emphatic. The chief
                        loss is the overwash of lines on the left leg, suggestive of a veil or
                        cloud.</p>
          <p>9. Three-quarters design of agonized Los (?), hands crossed over ears: far
                        too red. Gold flecking above head, to the right of and below the body, is
                        lost.</p>
          <p>10. Two-thirds design of crouched skeleton. Background of text should be
                        light blue, not violet, with azure rather than black above skeletal circle.
                        The basic hue of the skeleton is gold to green, not, as here, orange to red.
                        Flecked gold accentuating cranium and other parts of skeleton is lost.</p>
          <p>11. Full-page design of shackled, weeping old man. The figure sits on golden
                        vegetation, with golden rocks next to his right shoulder, and gold also
                        implicated in the halo-sunburst surrounding his head. That burst is bright
                        red here, but orange to deep red in the original. The face and body have a
                        basic gray cast in the original: here there is much pink and red.</p>
          <p>12. One-third headpiece of figure in rear view supporting rocks. Again as
                        before, the rock should be suffused with gold.</p>
          <p>13. Two-thirds tailpiece with emaciated figure and Los, surrounded and
                        divided by flames. The text has a gray, not violet, wash. The skeletal
                        figure, here an olive brown, has a distinctly green cast with silver flecks
                        on his legs. Los, in contrast, has gold flecks on his legs. There is also
                        gold to far left and in flames above Los; the flames have a lighter rose
                        tint.</p>
          <p>14. Full-page design of crouched nude, arms behind head, has too much red and
                        white. There is gold <pb id="p14-140" n="140"/> leaf throughout the corona
                        surrounding the figure.</p>
          <p>15. Central design of figure holding apart clouds lacks gold in clouds and on
                        rear of head and left shoulder.</p>
          <p>16. Three-quarters design of four heavenly figures looking down to earth. The
                        cloud drapery out of which the two on the right emerge should be a
                        gray-azure, not rich blue. Gold leaf surrounds the descending arm of the one
                        figure. The medium in which his hand trails should be a gray-blue suggestive
                        of water, not green. An anomalous red bull’s-eye intruding just to
                        the left of the plunging beard of the figure to the far right suggests
                        defective film or unprofessional processing: Blake is not responsible for
                        it.</p>
          <p>17. Full-page design of globe emerging from hair of bent figure is perhaps
                        beyond the capacity of a photograph to reproduce. Considerable gold leaf
                        distinguishes the globe.</p>
          <p>18. Three-quarters tailpiece of a cruciform Los in flames, with hammer in
                        left hand and right hand on rock. Gold leaf is missing from the bottom.
                        There is some success in capturing his immersion in flames here.</p>
          <p>19. One-third headpiece of ascending Enitharmon and crouched Los. The text is
                        backed by a much more pronounced gray wash. Background in the design should
                        be gray-black with azure, not turquoise, shading. In the original, gold at
                        Enitharmon’s foot suggests fire, with gray smoke billowing to her
                        left: this simply is lost.</p>
          <p>20. One-third tailpiece of infant falling in fire. A blotchy woodcut quality
                        at the bottom is without basis in the original. The dominant color of the
                        fire is yellow, not as here orange, with streaks of gold.</p>
          <p>21. Full-page design of Los-Enitharmon-Orc. The true cast of these bodies is
                        gray: the whitishred tones here are still preferable to the inexplicable
                        chocolate to which they are darkened in the Trianon edition.</p>
          <p>22. Two-thirds tailpiece of Urizen exploring his dens. The blue is too
                        strong, and red splashes in the rocks behind Urizen are missing, but this
                        plate is relatively close to the original.</p>
          <p>23. Full-page design of heavily draped, moving figure, viewed from the rear.
                        Heavy red striations on the drapery, overpainted in the original, have a
                        distinct and ugly presence here.</p>
          <p>24. Full-page design of Urizen’s four children, the elements, is a
                        very poor reproduction. Green at the top is transmuted to orange; bluish
                        gray sky to heavy blue; the gray-green vegetation out of which Grodna arises
                        is olive, with his hand surrounded by scarlet, not orange. The muted orange
                        flesh tones in the original are altered to ugly pinks and reds.</p>
          <p>25. One-third headpiece with figures immersed in green medium and entwined
                        with serpent coils. The original gray-green has become forest green, with
                        the purple wash at the bottom a gray-blue.</p>
          <p>26. Full-page design of boy and dog before immense door. The bottom half of
                        this plate looks as if it were splattered with bright red paint: these are
                        subtle accentuations of hue, done with orange, in the original.</p>
          <p>27. Two-thirds tailpiece with Urizen caught in his nets is in general too
                        olive in hue.</p>
          <p>Plate a of copy C—plate 4 of the reading text—is reproduced
                        following plate 27.</p>
          <p>To summarize briefly: one may ignore the aesthetic consequences of the
                        considerable transmutation of color values throughout the plates, but the
                        infidelity has interpretive significance as well. Fully a quarter of the
                        plates have lost detail essential to their meaning (plate 19 being
                        especially obvious), while the marked alteration in hue in several (e.g.
                        plates 2 and 16) obscures their import or subjects them to serious
                        misinterpretation. In effect, this is not a reliable facsimile for scholarly
                        purposes, nor can it be used with confidence in the classroom.</p>
          <p>The twenty-eight color plates are followed by a handsomely printed edition of
                        the text. The "Textual Note" acknowledges that "the nature of
                        the punctuation often shapes the reader’s perception of the meaning
                        of Blake’s words" (41), but that recognition has insufficiently
                        shaped the editors’ attitude toward their task. They appear not to
                        have been guided by the accrued consensus of modern editorial procedure,
                        which emphasizes a selfless modesty as the editor’s abiding virtue.
                        Instead, there is considerable editorial intrusion here, the main feature
                        being a lavish (and at times ungrammatical) sprinkling of commas throughout.
                        These have a palpable rhetorical effect, separating integrated components,
                        slowing the momentum, and often removing a studied ambiguity of modification
                        that is distinctly Blakean. One recognizes that Blake’s
                        idiosyncrasies, like those of Emily Dickinson, pose insoluble problems for a
                        systematic editor. Still, the caveat should be that less is more. Here, the
                        rule is that an editor’s job is to make editorial decisions wherever
                        possible. Many are curious; some are clearly wrong.</p>
          <p>A few examples, compared with the original, will illustrate the effect of
                        such fussing with the text. (I identify line numbers, which are not included
                        in this edition, for convenience.) <q> And self-balanc’d,

                            cruel delight<lb/> She fled from his arms, yet he followd </q> In both
                        these cases Blake’s intentions are clear. The misunderstanding of
                        Blake’s point of emphasis for an end-stop in plate 4 forces
                        "Bound" to do service as a passive participle, a wholly
                        unnecessary barbarism. The second case speaks for itself; it is a model of
                        the success often attained by Blake’s peculiar ideas on punctuation.
                        The intruded stoppage obliterates the rapid succession of interdependent
                        actions and the double import of line 12.</p>
          <p>If the Eassons were consistent in regularizing Blake’s punctuation,
                        one might overlook cases where they deliberately remove it. But they retain
                        and dismiss seemingly at will. These two examples, for instance, violate
                        Blake’s apparent intentions, and one is simply puzzled to understand
                        what would motivate or justify such unsupported emendations. <q> In

                            round;<lb/> His nervous brain shot branches<lb/> Round the branches of

                            (22:2-7)<lb/><lb/> And his world teemd vast enormities<lb/> Frightning;
                            faithless; fawning<lb/> Portions of life; similitudes<lb/> Of a foot, or

                            Dread terrors! delighting in blood </q> Similarly, the end-stop of
                        15:53-54 is wrongly placed, as the parallel repetition of 18:5 surely
                        indicates. Sometimes, such rhetorical leads are all that Blake offers a
                        reader or editor, and they cannot be disregarded. But sometimes, too,
                        emendation cannot be avoided. Faced with a shambles, does it make sense to
                        create another? I quote the original first, then the Eassons’
                        version: <q> Shudd’ring, the Eternal Prophet smote<lb/> With a
                            stroke, from his north to south region<lb/> The bellows &amp; hammer
                            are silent now<lb/> A nerveless silence, his prophetic voice<lb/>
                            Siez’d; a cold solitude &amp; dark void<lb/> The Eternal Prophet
                            &amp; Urizen clos’d<lb/><lb/> Shudd’ring, the Eternal
                            Prophet smote<lb/> With a stroke, from his north to south region.<lb/>
                            The bellows &amp; hammer are silent now,<lb/> A nerveless silence, his
                            prophetic voice<lb/> Siez’d, a cold solitude &amp; dark
                            void<lb/> The Eternal Prophet &amp; Urizen clos’d. (15:35-41)
                        </q> Adding two periods and reducing a semicolon to the force of a comma do
                        not bring sense to the passage. But if one reads Blake’s punctuation
                        as indicative of stress and also gives due force to line-endings, one might
                        come up with something like the dark, dramatic force that Hazard Adams
                        realizes for his Rinehart reading text: <q> Shudd’ring, the Eternal
                            Prophet smote<lb/> With a stroke from his north to south region.<lb/>
                            The bellows &amp; hammer are silent now.<lb/> A nerveless silence his
                            prophetic voice<lb/> Seized, a cold solitude &amp; dark void.<lb/> The
                            Eternal Prophet &amp; Urizen closed. </q></p>
          <p>Finally, I cite a passage whose punctuation makes no sense at all: it could
                        have only one source, the raising in the photographic print of a faint dot,
                        accepted as such by most previous editors, into a full-fledged comma in
                        plate 25, line 12. One supposes, then, that the inadequacies of reproduction
                        have had their unfortunate effect on the text as well. <q> And where-ever he
                            wander’d in sorrows<lb/> Upon the aged heavens,<lb/> A cold
                            shadow follow’d behind him,<lb/> Like a spider’s web,
                            moist, cold, &amp; dim,<lb/> Drawing out from his sorrowing soul<lb/>
                            The dungeon-like heaven dividing,<lb/> Where ever the footsteps of
                            Urizen<lb/> Walk’d over the cities in sorrow. (25:7-14) </q> If
                        one transposes the comma of line 12 to follow "heaven" rather than
                        "dividing," the passage makes perfect sense.</p>
          <p>The passages cited here are striking representations of a list that could be
                        extended considerably with more minor examples. One does not wish to be
                        either uncharitable or excessively pedantic, but my own sense is that the
                        list is too long to be dismissed with a shrug. Nor is its presence to be
                        extenuated by arguing that, in critiquing it, the critic wants absolute
                        fidelity in one place and emendation in another. If editors are to command
                        authority, they must proceed from clear principles and with critical
                        perception. These are not the hallmarks of this edition. Neither
                        conservative nor loose in practice, the edition has a tendency to violate
                        common sense and a distinct unwillingness to leave "well enough"
                        alone.</p>
          <p>The commentary exhibits the same penchant on a grand scale, and again one
                        surmises that the purposes for which such a commentary exists have been <pb id="p14-142" n="142"/> inadequately considered. Rather than establish a
                        basic set of premises for reading <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi>,
                        suggesting areas for exploration and leaving the reader to distinguish plain
                        from swamp, the Eassons have attempted an exhaustive reading of the poem in
                        thirty-five pages of print. To many it will perhaps appear as an exhausted
                        misreading, for where the commentary might have been simply provocative of
                        new possibilities for looking at the poem, it becomes rigidly dogmatic,
                        riding its various theses into a lather.</p>
          <p>For all their fulminations against Urizen, "The Adversary," and
                        their enjoinders to their students to look within, the Eassons seem not to
                        have recognized that it is all perfectly fine to cast him as the barrier to
                        spiritual travel, whatever that is, but that, more to the point and closer
                        to home, Urizen’s spirit dominates this commentary. The primeval
                        Priest is the first to ride a thesis, the creator of formulae that
                        obliterate necessary distinctions in search of inflexible pattern, the
                        regularizer who converts analogy into systematic identity, metaphor into
                        doctrine. This commentary boasts the most thorough analysis yet attempted of
                        the import of embryology for <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen.</hi> As
                        potentially significant as such an investigation might be, it is
                        inappropriate here on two accounts. First, the proper home for such an
                        elaboration is a learned journal: here, though there is considerable
                        assumption of eighteenth-century scientific knowledge, there is not a single
                        reference to substantiate it, and thus one has no solid terms by which to
                        judge the accuracy or sensitivity of the application. Second, there is a
                        crucial misunderstanding of the aims and limits of metaphor, which need have
                        neither the factual truth, the consistency, the elaborateness, nor the
                        scientific credibility of a treatise on gestation. <hi rend="i">The Book of
                            Urizen</hi> is pummeled from all sides to accord with such a model. If
                        contemporary physiology demands, as the editors say, that halfway through
                        the nine-month period of human gestation the sensorium be developed, then
                        halfway through this nine-chapter progression that must be seen to happen.
                        "The brain case is produced in the fifth chapter; the soul appears in
                        the sixth chapter. The soul, having been introduced, is enclosed within the
                        sensorium in the seventh chapter, and the brain begins to function"
                        (76). This seems disarmingly simple—until one looks at the
                        appropriate texts; for this particular brain-case goes by the name of
                        Enitharmon, and her son Orc is, by force of logic, the soul. Having begun
                        the trail of a logical fallacy, the commentary must take it to its end.
                        "When Orc, the soul, is formed, Urizen, hearing the voice of the child,
                        awakens. Apparently, Blake believed the fetus quickened, came to life, began
                        to move, in its seventh month" (79).</p>
          <p>A second metaphorical elaboration, of "The Book of Error" and
                        "The Book of Transformation," is even more elaborate, and, not
                        having even the textual basis of embryology to go on, is correspondingly
                        more eccentric. Picking up the witty self-referential comments on engraving
                        in <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, the Eassons pursue the
                        extent to which <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> is a critique of
                        traditional bookmaking. And there is virtually no limit to it, though there
                        is also not a single piece of evidence to support the supposition.
                        Typesetting is seen as almost the ultimate in Urizenic behavior, with no
                        greater sin than that of justifying margins. A quick glance at Calvinist
                        justification is enough to wither Milton by metaphorical transfer, and we
                        turn to the plates for pages of corroboration. <hi rend="i">Post hoc, ergo
                            propter hoc</hi>: the fetal skeleton of plate 10 is the very type of the
                        book; the trees to be found here and there in the plates represent books,
                        inasmuch as trees have leaves; the preponderance of tailpiece designs surely
                        indicates that "the foot of the artist/prophet is bruising the head of
                        the typographer/serpent" (91); and a little in-depth inspection of the
                        falling, serpent-bound trio of plate 7 reveals that the plate is actually
                        about books, the spine of the central figure (who is, let us recall, facing
                        us) coming in the center of the plate and the spectral faces between the
                        figures being here called flayed skins, which are the materials for
                        book-binding, the entire plate representing "Blake’s visionary
                        joke" (99) about royal folios.</p>
          <p>I don’t get it. The real joke is that such an extensive travesty of
                        the rules of evidence and of logical development should be serious and that
                        it should be accepted without question by a reader—or a
                        press—on the grounds of "mad Blake." Students, with an
                        unerring instinct for the outrageous and obscure, will be quoting this stuff
                        to their teachers for decades, especially since much of the tone of the
                        commentary is ostentatiously pitched down to a freshman level. Urizen
                        "is incapable of meaningful communication . . . meaningful
                        conversation" (69), just like Charley down the hall in the dormitory;
                        but if Charley responds best to Daffy Duck, remember that "<hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> has . . . a seeming comic book clarity.
                        However, while <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> is comic, Blake intentionally
                        compounds its comic clarity with prophetic obscurity" (88).</p>
          <p>The Eassons, who are experienced journal editors, have ventured into editing
                        Blake for the first time, and unquestionably they and their projects would
                        have profited from experienced editorial oversight. Half of the commentary
                        should have been suppressed, and a rigorous scrutiny—not that of
                        Urizen, but of Los—applied to the whole. You do not advance
                        scholarship or knowledge by indulging in high-school cant or culture, nor by
                        placing the claims of perverse ingenuity above the formal demands of logic,
                        nor by speculating wildly without a shred of support under the pretense of
                        editorial authority. You do by such indulgences set a decidedly negative
                        example for students, one that I would predict most educators would prefer
                        not to have to counter.</p>
          <p>It would have been good for the Eassons to have pondered the local
                        application of the sentence with which they begin their long exposition of
                        "The Book of Error": "According to Blake, the medium of the
                        book is predisposed to generate error, though it is not necessary that the
                        medium of the book cause error" (81). The fact of the matter is that
                        this edition generates and dispenses a remarkable amount of error in each of
                        its three divisions. It was not necessary that it do so, nor that any
                        successors, if there are to be such in this series, should do so. There is
                        commendable ambition in this series: the <pb id="p14-143" n="143"/>
                        opportunity to do lasting service to Blake studies is manifest. But there is
                        a commensurate responsibility on the part of the editors, a responsibility
                        to which in this volume they appear wholly unconscious. Reviewers, who in
                        their professional existence prefer the dulcet tones of Palamabron to the
                        hard judgments of Rintrah, nonetheless must assume their
                        responsibility—with the hope that both editors and reviewers, the
                        next time around, will discover the States that please both them and the
                        Blake community.</p>

          <p>The purpose of this study, Jackson says in his introductory chapter, is
                        "to propose yet another approach to the complicated subject of English
                        poetry and criticism in the later years of the eighteenth century, my
                        inquiry guided by sustained reference to the informing theme of the probable
                        and the marvelous" (p. 3). At the beginning of his concluding chapter,
                        he suggests that the usefulness of the work lies not "in the way of
                        discrete analysis," of which there is a considerable amount but for the
                        most part not unfamiliar to students of the period, but rather "within
                        the area of general interpretation" (p. 169). The interpretation he
                        offers is historical, laying out a kind of map of the changes occurring not
                        only in the ways in which poems were made and responded to but in
                        assumptions about the arts, human nature, and the relation between the ideal
                        and the real. The changes are focused in two revolutions, the first in the
                        middle and the second at the end of the eighteenth century.</p>
          <p>The contours of Jackson’s map can be clarified by comparing it with
                        that presented by the students of "pre-romanticism" seventy or
                        eighty years ago, who covered the same time-span and the same critics and
                        poets. Beers, Phelps, Gosse, Saintsbury, and others of that school were like
                        Jackson in seeing the mid-century writers as "intentionally and
                        radically disruptive of the complex equilibrium maintained by the major late
                        seventeenth-and early eighteenth-century writers" (p. 15)—as in
                        revolt against what Saintsbury called the "neo-classic creed" and
                        Jackson "neoclassical restraint" (p. 30) or "Augustan
                        humanism" (p. 62). They differ from him in their
                        late-nineteenth-century assumption, tacit but unshakable, that the Romantics
                        had discovered the true nature of poetry and in their contention that
                        Collins, Gray, the Wartons, Hurd, and other contemporaries had at least
                        partially glimpsed the same truth and striven to follow it; as Gosse
                        quaintly remarked, they were "bicyclist scouts who prophesied of an
                        advance that was nearly fifty years delayed." Jackson is much too
                        sophisticated to make the first assumption, and he finds much more
                        difference than resemblance between the mid-century poets and the Romantics.
                        In his view, the revolution of Blake and Wordsworth was made necessary by
                        "a mid-century poetic of such drastic limitations that it offered the
                        poet no specifically contemporary act of mind and no imitative models other
                        than the extrapolated sublimities of past poets" (p. 80; cf. 87, 144,
                        180-81, etc.), and the reform was directed at least as <pb id="p14-144" n="144"/> much against that poetic and the art it produced as it was
                        against Dryden, Pope, and Swift. If anything important was shared by the two
                        revolutions, it was a desire to restore passion to poetry, but they differed
                        radically on the nature of passion and the means by which it could be
                        realized poetically.</p>
          <p>Jackson argues for a historical continuity from Shakespeare, Spenser, and
                        Milton through the eighteenth century to Blake and Wordsworth, but in a
                        curious way most of the causal connections seem to lie in the kind of
                        influence that Harold Bloom has called "creative misprision." Each
                        generation made its own selection from and interpretation of its
                        predecessors. Collins and Gray found inspiration and a model in
                        Milton’s minor works, especially <hi rend="i">L’Allegro</hi>
                        and <hi rend="i">Il Pensoroso</hi>, but were blind to the Christian and
                        Platonic elements that were essential to Miltonic sublimity. As Irene
                        Tayler, John Grant, and Kathleen Raine have previously observed,
                        Blake’s illustrations of Milton, Gray, Young, and Blair reveal the
                        terms in which he preferred to read their poems, often contrary to their
                        authors’ intentions, reinterpreting and reorganizing "the latent
                        potentialities of vision which Blake discerned within them" (p. 90; cf.
                        88, 89, 91). In his own poems he returned to the subject of <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> and <hi rend="i">Paradise Regained</hi>, but he
                        rewrote the Miltonic theme of innocence and experience, correcting what
                        seemed to him the limitations and misconceptions of his great predecessor
                        (pp. 112-14). Jackson does not make this kind of point about Wordsworth,
                        however.</p>
          <p>Since his interest is in historical continuity, it is understandable that
                        Jackson should concentrate on the early works of the two Romantic poets whom
                        he discusses, without attempting any comprehensive treatment of their total
                            <hi rend="i">oeuvres.</hi> In the chapter on Blake (ch. 4) his main
                        concern is with the <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> and <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>, with some supporting evidence from the early, shorter
                        prophetic works and a few references to the still earlier <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches.</hi> On the side of general interpretation,
                        Jackson’s main contentions are that Blake built his revolution on
                        that of the mid-century poets, inheriting the passions from them but
                        mythologizing the gift and transforming it into the terms of his own vision;
                        that the emergence of Romanticism is best accounted for by the confluence of
                        mid-century passion with the dissenting religious tradition, heterodox
                        Christianity; and that Blake’s lifetime task was to reimagine
                        Milton’s myth of innocence and experience (pp. 108-14). On the side
                        of discrete analysis, as Jackson calls it, his readings are interesting but
                        somewhat unorthodox. He thinks that E. D. Hirsch is misleading in
                        recommending that the poems of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> should be read
                        seriatim and as an autonomous whole, and Robert Gleckner mistaken in
                        claiming that the meaning of Blake’s symbols is accretively
                        established from occurrence to occurrence. In Jackson’s less unitary
                        view, the <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> are not exclusively about
                        innocence, although they unmethodically explore that state, and the various
                        speakers see it in different perspectives. In "The Chimney
                        Sweeper," for example, the speaker is a corrupt, rationalizing voice of
                        experience which offers a hypocritical moral about "duty" at the
                        end of the poem. The morality of "pity" in "Holy
                        Thursday" is similarly corrupt, "the rigorous and stony-eyed truth
                        of an abstract morality" (pp. 97-99). It would be interesting to see
                        some responses to these readings.</p>
          <p>In the chapter on Wordsworth (ch. 5) Jackson’s evidence is primarily
                        drawn from the <hi rend="i">Lyrical Ballads</hi> and <hi rend="i">Poems in
                            Two Volumes</hi>, 1798-1807, though with full awareness of the <hi rend="i">Prelude</hi> and <hi rend="i">Excursion.</hi> The argument is
                        more diffuse than that of the Blake chapter, almost half of it being a
                        prolegomenon (pp. 123-44) on the mid-century poets, with a few pages on
                        Coleridge; much of this background material repeats points already made in
                        chapters 2 and 3, and its pertinence to Wordsworth is not always clear.
                        Although Wordsworth had apparently not read Blake until 1807, after the
                        publication of <hi rend="i">Poems in Two Volumes</hi>, Jackson finds the
                        poems in that work to be commonly concerned with innocence and experience as
                        states of the soul. "To a Butterfly," "The Green
                        Linnet," "To a Young Lady," "The Sparrow’s
                        Nest," Written in March," and "To the Cuckoo" are all
                        songs of innocence, while "The Small Celandine" and "A
                        Complaint" describe the contrary state. Wordsworth’s conception
                        of the fall from innocence to experience is different from Blake’s,
                        according to Jackson, since the latter recognizes it as not only inevitable
                        but productive of good through the prophetic imagination and the mental
                        warfare it generates, while Wordsworth "seeks ways to minimize its
                        reality, to limit and curtail its effects by strategies that begin with
                        recovery and lead to transcendence" (p. 156). Jackson supports this
                        interpretation by extended exegeses of the Lucy poems, "Resolution and
                        Independence," and the "Immortality" ode. In this major phase
                        of his career, Jackson concludes, Wordsworth "has recreated an image of
                        human nature both probable and marvelous, the fusion of the ordinary and the
                        sublime within the permanent image of man" (p. 168).</p>
          <p>If I have any serious reservations about this well-written and challenging
                        study, they arise from two distortions, as they seem to me, which he shares
                        with the old-fashioned students of pre-romanticism. The first is to
                        exaggerate greatly the revolutionary thrust of mid-century critics, as when
                        he asserts that their position on the relation between the probable and the
                        marvelous was "hardly tempered at all by moderate neoclassic
                        principles" (p. 26). Hurd sounded radical to Beers and Phelps when he
                        defended Gothic elements in Renaissance epic poems, but he did so in terms
                        of imitation, nature, the rules, and poetic effects proportioned to the
                        kinds. In spite of his belief that the chief nerves of genuine poetry are
                        the sublime and the pathetic, so that <hi rend="i">Eloisa to Abelard</hi>
                        and the <hi rend="i">Elegy to an Unfortunate Lady</hi> are superior to
                        Pope’s satires and moral epistles, Joseph Warton still operates
                        within the traditional framework summed up in Dryden’s definition,
                        "just and lively images of human nature" and Johnson’s
                        "just representations of general nature." The Time-Spirit may have
                        been carrying Warton along, as Saintsbury said, but it did not sweep him far
                        out to sea.</p>
          <p>The fundamental error of the Beers-Phelps school was to apply
                        nineteenth-century categories and criteria in interpreting the thought and
                        art of the mid-eighteenth century. In my opinion, Jackson <pb id="p14-145" n="145"/> distorts Blake and Wordsworth by a similar but converse
                        anachronism, interpreting them through the theme of the probable and the
                        marvelous, an issue and a terminology that belong to a different, earlier
                        realm of thought and discourse. The resulting account, which he describes as
                        "no distortion of literary history"—"not a
                        historian’s invention but a discovery"—has some prima
                        facie descriptive plausibility as applied to Wordsworth, since he avowedly
                        attempted in the <hi rend="i">Lyrical Ballads</hi> to present ordinary
                        things to the mind in an unusual aspect, throwing a certain coloring of
                        imagination over incidents and situations from common life (Preface of
                        1800). He can even say, in a letter defending <hi rend="i">Peter Bell</hi>,
                        that the action of the imagination does not require supernatural agency but
                        may be called forth "by incidents within the compass of poetic
                        probability" (quoted by Jackson, p. 146). But neither he nor Blake
                        thought habitually or systematically in terms of such an opposition; it is
                        drawn from a radically different intellectual context and is alien to their
                        new ways of conceiving man, God, nature, and art. If we may adopt M. H.
                        Abram’s fruitful contrast, the notion of a mean or balance between
                        the probable and the marvelous belongs to the aesthetics of the mirror, not
                        to the Romantic poetic of the lamp.</p>

          <p>Joseph Johnson was a major publisher, a friend of Henry Fuseli and William
                        Godwin, patron of William Cowper and Mary Wollstonecraft and William Blake,
                        publisher of Erasmus Darwin and William Wordsworth, of S. T. Coleridge and
                        Joseph Priestley, of Tom Paine and Horne Tooke, of Humphrey Davy and T. R.
                        Malthus, of Maria Edgworth and William Beckford. The most advanced poets,
                        political, medical, and religious writers, and scientists of the last
                        quarter of the eighteenth century in London were his authors, his customers,
                        and his friends. Any work seriously concerned with such authors or such
                        books must deal with Joseph Johnson and his publishing house. And until Dr.
                        Gerald Tyson published <hi rend="i">Joseph Johnson</hi>: A Liberal Publisher
                        in May 1979, very little was known of either.</p>
          <p>A symptom of the neglect of Johnson is the fact that Joseph Aikin’s
                        obituary of him in <hi rend="i">The Gentleman’s Magazine</hi> in 1809
                        "found its way unchanged into the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of National
                            Biography</hi>" ninety years later (pp. 215, 217). There have been
                        a few articles about him in the last decade and a half, by Tyson, Phyllis
                        Mann, Jane Smyser, Paul Zall, and especially Leslie Chard, but previous to
                        this there <pb id="p14-146" n="146"/> was little in print about Johnson
                        beyond what Gilchrist published in his biography of Blake in 1863.</p>
          <p>To tell the truth, there is <hi rend="i">still</hi> not much known about
                        Joseph Johnson as an individual, for clearly he was a genial but
                        self-effacing man. He did not write books himself, very little of his
                        correspondence has been traced, and his contemporaries did not write much
                        about him. This book is not so much about Joseph Johnson as it is about his
                        publishing house, or rather about the books he published and his
                        relationships with their authors. It is a topological paradox, a circle
                        without a center. Of the books Johnson published, what contemporaries
                        thought of them, Johnson’s generosity to their authors, we learn a
                        good deal. But of the man who focused and fostered so much of this activity,
                        we still know surprisingly little.</p>
          <p>This is not for lack of energy or thoroughness on Dr. Tyson’s part. He
                        has used an impressive range of original sources, from reviews of the most
                        important books Johnson published to manuscript diaries of their authors,
                        and he has consulted manuscripts in Guildhall Library, Stationers’
                        Hall, the Public Record Office, Houghton Library, Bodley, Dr.

                        Congress, as well, of course, as the most important books Johnson
                            published.<ref target="n6" type="note">1</ref> We must reconcile
                        ourselves to knowing little of Joseph Johnson the man, for if Dr. Tyson has
                        not found such information it is not likely to survive. And in any case,
                        even though Fuseli lived with Johnson for eight years and Mary
                        Wollstonecraft treated him as father, brother, and priest, his chief
                        importance is as a publisher and a patron of authors. In these roles we see
                        him in considerable detail. <note id="n6"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Despite this
                            admirable research, a good deal of the information in the book,
                            particularly about Johnson’s authors, still derives from <hi rend="i">The Dictionary of National Biography.</hi> It might

          <p>Of his life outside publishing, there are comparatively few facts. Among the
                        more intriguing are that he was apprenticed in 1754 for a fee of £63 to
                        the Musicians’ Guild (p. 6), not to the Stationers’ Company,
                        that he was a stout Unitarian and numbered many Unitarians among his
                        authors, and that the epitaph on his tombstone was composed by Fuseli (p.
                        215).</p>
          <p>His generosity and hospitality were instinctive to the man and were
                        enormously important in attracting and securing authors to him. In 1839
                        William West wrote: <q> Under his roof were, perhaps, as much genius, taste,
                            and talent combined among the distinguished writers who assembled at his
                            weekly literary parties, as at any house in the kingdom. . . . I believe
                            the only picture that ornamented his plain old dining room was
                            Fuseli’s original painting of the Nightmare. . . . Mr.
                            Johnson’s business was for some time conducted by a person of the
                            name of Redman, who had, I believe, originally followed the Profession
                            of a schoolmaster, and retained the cross habits and manners of the
                            pedagogue. . . . [<hi rend="i">Once when I owed Johnson money</hi> which
                            I could not immediately <hi rend="i">pay</hi>] He handed me a check on
                            Coutts for upwards of 300 <hi rend="i">l.</hi>; told me to take what I
                            required, bring him the difference, and pay the remainder as soon as I
                            conveniently could.<ref target="n7" type="note">2</ref></q> Cowper wrote that "his behavior to me has been so liberal, that I
                        can refuse him nothing," and when Johnson corrected the poetry of <hi rend="i">The Task</hi> Cowper was profoundly grateful: <q> as often as I
                            could, I paid all possible respect to his animadversions. . . . I do not
                            know where I could have found a bookseller who could have pointed out to
                            me my defects with more discernment. . . .<lb/><lb/> (William Hayley,

                        Coleridge wrote that "purely out of affection conceived for me, &amp;

          <p>The facts about Johnson as a radical are particularly well handled. Johnson
                        was not only a publisher of radicals such as Tom Paine and Horne Tooke, but
                        he was active privately in radical causes as well. For instance, he
                        contributed £2. 11.0 for boots for the French Army in 1792 (p. 155), at
                        a time when official England was mobilizing its resources for war with
                        France. Dr. Tyson has found the documents in the Public Record Office
                        concerning Johnson’s trial for sedition under the gag laws, and he
                        quotes Johnson’s modest description of himself there: <q> this
                            Deponent further saith that his connections have been with respectable
                            and scientific Writers and his publications generally of a Moral,
                            Philosophical, and Medical Nature, many of which as this Deponent is
                            informed are an honour to his Country.<lb/> (p. 160) </q> Such has been
                        the verdict of history, but a packed jury found him guilty of selling a
                        radical book, and he was sentenced to six months in prison. During his
                        incarceration, his business was carried on, doubtless to the
                        Government’s chagrin, but, as William Gifford exulted in <hi rend="i">The Anti-Jacobin Review</hi>, the <q> objects of our immediate attacks,
                            the <hi rend="i">Analytical Review</hi> [published by Joseph Johnson],
                            has received its death-blow, and we have more reason to congratulate
                            ourselves upon the share which we have had in producing its dissolution,
                            than it would be expedient here to unfold.<lb/><lb/> (p. 167) </q><pb id="p14-147" n="147"/> As Dr. Tyson remarks, <hi rend="i">The
                            Anti-Jacobin Review</hi> was a treasury journal (p. 166).</p>
          <p>Joseph Johnson’s name appears on several thousand imprints. About half
                        of these were pamphlets, and more than half of the total were reprints.
                        About a quarter of the titles were anonymous, mostly religious and political
                        works, and the largest single category was religion. Johnson published
                        comparatively little fiction, and most of the fiction he did produce was
                        propagandistic. (Dr. Tyson does not mention Johnson’s important
                        relationship with Charlotte Smith as publisher of her novels.) The most
                        important lack in the book is a bibliography, or even a list, of
                        Johnson’s publications. Clearly such a list would have been enormous
                        and would have quite altered the character of the book, but without details
                        of either publisher or publications the reader often feels himself to be in
                        a twilight land, seeing uncertainly in the half-light and unable to
                        distinguish for himself the woods from the trees. We may hope that Dr. Tyson
                        will publish the list of Johnson’s publications which, according to
                            <hi rend="i">his</hi> publisher’s blurb, he has already
                        collected. Only then will we be able to place this book in a proper
                        context.</p>
          <p>It should also be recognized that there are few technical details here about
                        Johnson’s publishing house. There is no list of the printers he used,
                        cost analyses, description of his house style, account of the paper in the
                        books, the mode of issue (stitched, in parts, by subscription, etc.), or the
                        publishers with whom he joined in partnership or in congeries. This is a
                        publishing history in the perfectly legitimate old-fashioned sense of an
                        account of patronage and friendship and how they affected literary
                        substance. <hi rend="i">Joseph Johnson</hi>: <hi rend="i">A Liberal
                            Publisher</hi> is a worthy publication of modest pretensions and
                        dimensions, and careful scholars concerned with the last quarter of the
                        eighteenth century will long be indebted to Dr. Tyson’s devoted
                        labors. We are unlikely to have a more comprehensive account of
                        Johnson’s circle, and that circle was of major importance in the
                        political, religious, medical, intellectual, and poetic life of his time.
                        But a circle without a center is a ring, and in this book it is the ring
                        which is important. And doubtless this is as Joseph Johnson would have
                        wished. A publisher lives through his publications and his authors, and it
                        is astonishing how many of Johnson’s authors are considered, in 1800
                        and in 1980, to be of major importance. It is through this ring of bright
                        authors that Johnson lives today.</p>

          <p><hi rend="i">Blake’s Writings</hi> is the natural yet transcendent
                        culmination of the monumental trilogy which Professor Bentley has been
                        constructing for us since he began his work on Blake some twenty-five years
                        ago. As the capstone to a library cromlech otherwise comprised of <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> (1969) and <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>
                        (1977), it inevitably participates a good deal in the essential matter of
                        the double pillars which support it, and, as Bentley suggests, is meant to
                        be supplemented by them when economies of time, space, and editorial policy
                        curtail bibliographical description and certain annotative and referential
                        materials. The editor’s primary purpose here has been to
                        "present Blake’s writings in a form as close to his originals as
                        type will permit." Volume I contains the engraved and etched writings,
                        with all (or nearly all) significant illuminations reproduced in black and
                        white. Volume II contains all writings in conventional typography and in
                        manuscript, including the letters and marginalia. The Introduction includes
                        a brief account of previous important editions, statements of purpose and
                        editorial methods, and is followed by comparably brief accounts of the
                        printing and coloring of the illuminated works. Typically, the
                        Bibliographical Notes for each illuminated work provide information about
                        date, publication, coloring, catchwords, order, significant variants,
                        errata, and copytext, with <hi rend="i">ad hoc</hi> notices of running
                        heads, designs, and plate sizes, as they seem necessary or helpful. The
                        Notes for the writings in conventional typography and in manuscript vary
                        considerably according to the demands of the text described, but generally
                        include location, watermark, leafsize, date, and description, with specific
                        notice as needed of copytext, page and line numbering, design, running
                        heads, full title page, collation, press figures, catchwords, corrections,
                        ornaments, stab-holes, and order, while certain works are provided with
                        selectively expansive commentary: <hi rend="i">Vala’</hi>s dating,
                        description, and variant handwriting; the <hi rend="i">Notebook’</hi>s designs, description, and location. Supplementary
                        materials include a chronologically arranged table of contents which locates
                        both texts and corresponding bibliographical notes, a list and description
                        of lost works, a list of the source and location of each plate reproduced,
                        an alphabetized list of present-day locations of contemporary copies of
                        Blake’s writings, tables of ambiguously broken words, of repeated
                        lines and designs, along with keys (maps) to Blake’s London, Britain,
                        and Holy Land, and a preface containing about sixty addenda and corrigenda,
                        which selectively update through 1967 a text that went to press in 1971 and
                        achieved its galley-proof definition in 1974.</p>
          <p>In the body of the text each illuminated work is provided with brief
                        footnotes describing the design, variants in different copies (repeated in
                        the Notes), as well as cross references, verbal changes, and identifications
                        of people and places (usually historical or biblical). As a rule, the design
                        descriptions are physically representative and conservative rather than
                        symbolic and expansive, while the informational notes are relatively lean
                        when compared with, say, those in the Longman <hi rend="i">Complete
                            Poems.</hi> Volume II does not categorize its notes in the same way, but
                        it provides, when apt, essentially the same kind of information. With a few
                        exceptions, the design reproductions compare favorably with those in <hi rend="i">The Illuminated Blake</hi>, though one may feel Bentley has
                        omitted some plates significant enough for reproduction, and one may lament
                        the fact that it was apparently necessary on <pb id="p14-149" n="149"/>
                        occasion to divide the top and bottom designs on a given plate by placing
                        them on successive pages. While the notes make no attempt at variorum
                        inclusiveness by providing a history of editorial readings and misreadings,
                        they do often (though perhaps not often enough) retail the textual
                        recoveries and alternative readings of David Erdman, at times with a hint or
                        statement that the Erdman eye has seen what Bentley does not believe is
                        strictly there to be seen.</p>
          <p>While there is still some disagreement about a very small number of
                        substantive readings in Blake’s illuminated works, the fact that for
                        virtually all their extant impressions there was in the beginning only one
                        (lost) archetypal source—the original copperplates—means that,
                        except for a few notorious scratchings out and maskings over and even fewer
                        verbal alterations, there is little question about the words of
                        Blake’s text from copy to copy, nor is there likely to be, even when
                        a substantive (e.g., <hi rend="i">Thel</hi>’s "Mne" and
                        "o’erfired") balks all effort at extracting any definitive
                        sense from it. Perhaps Bentley or Erdman or another keen-sighted adept in
                        Blake and in mechanical aids to perception will recover an erasure here and
                        a blot-out there—or perhaps rectify a word or two on the basis of
                        relevant collations—but diminishing returns from this much-gleaned
                        field may hardly seem to repay the scholarly effort at work in it.</p>
          <p>The continuing uneasiness which must afflict the conscientious editor as he
                        moves from impression to impression of a given copperplate will most likely
                        be inspired by the punctuation. At first glance, several reproductions from
                        a single archetype may seem to provide an editor with the maximum
                        opportunity for a punctilious fidelity to an author’s text but, in
                        this instance, wind up providing him with a minimum temptation to take
                        advantage of it. What abstractly considered seems to represent an ideal
                        combination of author, illustrator, printer, and publisher—a
                        veritable fourfold vision of a canon from its conceptual origin in Eden to
                        its empirical dissemination in Ulro—disorganizes into a mere chaos of
                        variable signs and inferences, chance associations, and contextual guesswork
                        which not only makes a given editor (and his readers) the victim of the
                        impression he chooses to rely on but threatens besides to invite the spectre
                        of deconstructionism into the very sanctum of bibliographical objectivity by
                        making every editor his own copytext, at least insofar as it matters what
                        impression he decides to call his copytext. While times and expectations
                        have changed since Geoffrey Keynes could tell us that he was redeeming
                        Blake’s text from the multitudinous accretions of error piled on it
                        by previous editors in providing a thoroughly accurate text which, in
                        effect, ignores Blake’s pointing, it is not yet certain that times
                        and expectations have therefore changed for the discernible better. How far
                        beyond varying kinds and degrees of editorial ignorance have we moved, and
                        can we move, when we find both Erdman and Bentley in fundamental agreement
                        about one major premise at least—that there is no telling from copy
                        to copy whether a given point at a given place in a given work by Blake is a
                        comma or period, or, by logical extension, a semicolon or a colon?</p>
          <p>The fact that the problem is compounded beyond a given editor’s choice
                        of copytext may be briefly highlighted by noting the different pointing
                        inferred from the unique copy of <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> by Erdman
                        (E) in his "diplomatic" text (1965) and by Bentley (B) in this
                        present "reconstructable" one. That is, E reproduces the pointing
                        (or lack of it) as he reads it from the impression(s) he uses; B provides
                        italics and half-brackets to indicate where he departs from the pointing in
                        his copytext. (I assume throughout that B relies on his copytext even in
                        accidentals unless he tells us otherwise.) Ideally—or perhaps as a
                        matter of course—we would expect that two such editors exercising
                        their eye-sight on a single mirror image of the archetypal copper would
                        evidence a fairly high degree of correlation when their points were
                        juxtaposed and added up. In fact, the editors disagree about nearly one
                        third of the pointings possible in the three relevant plates. What may we
                        infer? First of all, that Blake’s pointing is often so ambiguous in
                        its appearance that there is no defining it except arbitrarily.
                        Consequently, we may suppose that the editors tend to read these ambiguous
                        points differently, for whatever subjective, objective, or contextual
                        reasons. There is of course the possibility that one editor sees more keenly
                        than another, but insofar as that may be an applicable criterion, it
                        probably does not generally enter into differing inferences about
                        punctuation marks. The relative daring which E displays elsewhere in some of
                        his suggested recoveries and the conservatism evident in B’s sometime
                        dismay at what E has so recovered may be ascribed to other causes than
                        eyesight, not all of which are bibliographically relevant. What may be
                        bibliographically relevant is the fact that E, in reproducing his diplomatic
                        text, confesses to "wobbling" perhaps more than he should have in
                        the direction of "usual expectation" when grooming Blake’s
                        dots and digs to the periods and commas of a letterpress edition. B, on the
                        other hand, may save himself and his readers) from a temptation to so wobble
                        by his use of italics and semi-brackets, which allow him to print a
                        functional reading text for a modern audience while still preserving for the
                        scholar the underlying text as B thinks Blake etched it and which the
                        scholar can then reconstruct at his need and leisure. The happy result may
                        then be that B here provides a more accessible diplomatic text because he is
                        not beguiled by his concern for modern expectations into departing from a
                        computer-eyed rigor exercised on behalf of a consistent determination of a
                        given appearance of a Blakean point, at least within the confines of a given
                        context. That is the way it might have been. It does not really work out
                        that neatly in practice, nor is there any unassailable argument in favor of
                        its doing so.</p>
          <p>To return to <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi>, we may first note in passing
                        that here (as often elsewhere) substantive disagreements between B and E can
                        be definitively arbitrated in E’s favor: E’s "Not"
                        (10), "organs" (113), "the floods" (122),
                        "those" (146) are right, B’s readings wrong. Because the
                        copy rates in the upper percentiles among Blake impressions for its finely
                        etched clarity, a reviewer may take advantage of the invitation or challenge
                        provided by the numerous pointing disagreements between B and E by further,
                        if not definitive, arbitration, as a way <pb id="p14-150" n="150"/> into
                        more circumstantially focusing on one or more of the sources of those
                        disagreements. As I see them, E’s points are preferable in 11. 9, 40,
                        50 (after "not"), 62 (after "durance"), 83
                        ("tho’"), 105, 109, 125, 151, but in another twenty-odd
                        instances of disagreement B seems to me to have read the points as Blake
                        made them—e.g., 11. 18, 20, 58, 65, 69, 73, 112, 132, 175. At times,
                        even in this relatively clear impression, the pointing may be seen as either
                        B or E sees it (e.g., 80, 164, 171); at times they may both seem wrong
                        (e.g., 117 a semicolon or colon, 123 a period). On balance, B’s
                        punctuation looks most like what appears in the unique copy more often than
                        E’s does, partly because B more often allows us to have or
                        reconstruct the dot Blake seems to have made whereas E tends to opt for the
                        commas he and his anticipated readers may feel more comfortable with, though
                        this tendency is not so marked here as it is elsewhere. To what extent this
                        evaluation applies to other works will be partly indicated by what I say
                        later, but it should be noted at once that as the potential
                        "copy-texts" multiply, so do the variant apparitions of commas and
                        dots that dance before one’s eyes in the same place in different
                        copies. Given the high incidence of discrepant appearances of a given point
                        in different impressions from the same copperplate, it may well be that a
                        second copy of <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> could have sanctioned more
                        of E’s commas and fewer of B’s dots than the unique copy
                        warrants. Lo, what should an editor do? The answer may seem to
                        be—whatever he wants.</p>
          <p>Both B and E remind us, in their degree, that to supply punctuation is to
                        change it—and of course to change it is to change it. But if
                        it’s not a clear or consensus case that the mark Blake etched is a
                        comma or a period (as we may finally be obliged to call the indubitable dot,
                        even where it is fairly clear that Blake did not use it that way), how can
                        we be at all sure we are not changing his punctuation with every decision we
                        make? Even in supplying bracketed pointings an editor is often on the brink
                        of a misleading assumption simply because he is trying, however tentatively,
                        to suggest a needed relationship (according to modern needs, that is) which
                        may well have nothing at all to do with Blake’s asyntactical flow (or
                        blockage), and, who knows, may actually interfere with a submerged
                        rhetorical significance which a given reader might, if unaided,
                        apprehend.</p>
          <p>A related problem which may at first worry the editor and later occur to the
                        reader is that it is not at all clear that Blake was himself typically
                        concerned whether his etching tool discriminated a given point as a comma or
                        a period—whether in fact he distinguished between them either by
                        themselves or as bases for a semicolon or colon (or exclamation). What does
                        one finally make of those series and catalogs of epithets and names wherein
                        half the marks are well-rounded dots and half are stabbed out in the general
                        direction of a comma tail? Or how does one respond to a comparable series of
                        parallel phrases or clauses which initially separate their components with a
                        neat colon that evolves from point to point into a full-fledged exclamation
                        mark at series end? It may be that we are being so presented with a
                        progressive revelation of Blake’s growing emotional involvement with
                        his text and tool—something in the manner of Henry Moore’s
                        sculpting into his stone until the sky broke through—so that we might
                        engage all the more vitally in the immediacy of the poet’s creative
                        act. Perhaps. On the merely mechanical side, one may conjecture that not
                        only does a clearly imprinted comma in a given "best" or consensus
                        copytext look like a period in a few seemingly less preferable impressions
                        but also that it might have been made in the shape of a period in the
                        original copper. Peripheral hindrances to an accurate sighting on
                        Blake’s points appear in some impressions as stray splatter, wash
                        smudges, designing bits of vine, chaff, or pestilential blight, which,
                        depending on where they occur, could as well be dots and commas.</p>
          <p>As noted, B’s principles allow him to supply suggested punctuation as
                        he feels it desirable. More specifically, he supplies points where Blake had
                        none at all or he supplies alternatives to Blake’s ubiquitous dot as
                        he deems necessary. Besides the comparative virtues of this method as
                        already noted, another blessing is that intrusive signs of editorial
                        emendation are relatively minimal. But there are two main problems with the
                        method. The first, a side effect of the virtue just noted, is that stops
                        other than dots (or periods) will at times cry out with equal claim for <hi rend="i">ad hoc</hi> editorial attention. E.g., the interruptive
                        semicolon which Blake will occasionally plant between a subject and verb or
                        between a verb and its object. The second and more fundamental problem
                        deserves iteration: if one does not know whether a given point is a comma or
                        a period, how can he arbitrate his italics and semi-brackets into place with
                        any comfortable degree of assurance that he is living up either to
                        Blake’s syntactical guidelines, such as they may be, or to
                        one’s own editorial principles? If a comma in one impression appears
                        as a period in another (or even a dozen others), the reader may feel that he
                        is very nearly as much "at the mercy of the editor’s
                        judgment" in B’s text as he is in Keynes’. To some extent
                        these problems may seem to be resolved by the choice of copytext. But other
                        subliminal problems then begin to surface. Assuming that accidentals in
                        Blake might indeed have some authorial significance and therefore must be
                        presumed to have editorial significance, we may want a more exacting
                        justification of the choice of copytext than B (or E or anyone) provides
                        before we agree, plate by plate and line by line, that an editor has
                        exercised his judgment in such matters to, and perhaps beyond the limit of
                        the possible when he prefers copy O’s exclamation mark to copy
                        P’s colon. How does one decide whether the best text, as he sees it,
                        or the consensus text, as he arrives at it, provides him with the period he
                        may change to a comma or with the comma he cannot change to a period? Or can
                        one definitively wobble in such cases? And even if we agree that, roughly
                        speaking, the latest and least colored of many impressions (assuming that
                            <hi rend="i">that</hi> is an ascertainable choice) provides the best
                        overall guide to accident as well as to substance, may we be sure that
                        adherence to it in a given instance is not more the result of inertia than
                        of requisite collation? Or, what may be worse, a perfunctory adherence to a
                        principle of copytext selection which cannot really apply to Blake’s
                        methods of production <pb id="p14-151" n="151"/> and dissemination? Given
                        the conditions of publication, couldn’t it be that an assumed best
                        text may in a number of clear instances be much less than best? When several
                        impressions may have equal authority, it may well seem that a species of
                        eclectic edition is the only way to go, however arduous a task in collation
                        it may be for the editor and however suspect the result may seem to the
                        bibliographical fundamentalist. B has had the unique opportunity, as he
                        tells us, of inspecting all of the extant copies of the illuminated works.
                        It is not so clear as it might be that he has made the best use of that
                        opportunity from plate to plate and from line to line.</p>
          <p>In order for me to make the best use of the space available, I’d like
                        to pin-point specific problems about pointing, as perceived and supplied by
                        B, which will as well suggest more comprehensive problems of editorial
                        principles and copytext. As a general rule, these specifics are
                        representative of a host of others I’ve accumulated, but I should
                        note that I am mainly concerned with pointing out grounds for further
                        editorial surmise rather than with pointing an invidious finger at the bulk
                        of B’s volumes. Lest my overall appreciation of this quite handsome
                        and painstakingly compiled edition be lost in the shuffle of my sometimes
                        captious highlights and comments, I should note at the outset my comparative
                        estimate of its worth: it is on balance the best complete edition of
                        Blake’s works currently available for both the scholar and the
                        serious reader. Following B, I make frequent use of E for comparative
                        purposes where his editions are specifically relevant. I also use customary
                        or easily interpreted abbreviations for Blake’s works.</p>
          <p>MHH 8: 34 "The rat, the mouse, the fox, the rabbet; watch the roots, /
                        The lion, the tyger, the horse, the elephant, watch the fruits."
                        B’s principles allow him to do nothing with the interruptive
                        semicolon in 1. 1 but in 1. 2 allow him to remove the dot he sees before
                        each subject, including the one separating the parallel "watch"
                        predicate from its most immediate subject, "elephant." The comma
                        he supplies could have been eliminated altogether according to his
                        principles and modern practice, though in so mediating extremes as he does
                        he perhaps comes closer to what may be an implicit Blakean and/or rhetorical
                        norm at this point. Of course "normative" punctuation, when
                        aligned with one of B’s principles, could also have prescribed here
                        the semicolon before "watches" retained above as having more
                        contextual authority, but it would have been as bothersome to the modern
                        reader to so supply it as is the preceding semicolon which is allowed to
                        stand. E maintains his diplomatic credentials here (and keeps his readers
                        comfortable) by seeing B’s dots as commas. Without moving farther
                        afield, one may note comparable interruptive semicolons which must be
                        retained in 6:par. 24, "When I came home; on the abyss of the five
                        senses," and after "confirm’d" 12:par. 32, where
                        commas would probably have been provided if Blake had used dots instead of
                        semicolons. The apparent assumption behind such a distinction in editorial
                        practice is that Blake himself distinguished between semicolons and periods
                        in parallel constructions.</p>
          <p>MHH 7:par. 24 "with corroding fires [;] he wrote . . . " The
                        semicolon seems arbitrarily supplied to break up a relation that <hi rend="i">Blake’s</hi> pointing suggests he meant: "corroding
                        fires" describes the process by which the writing was done. Admittedly
                        these are judgment calls which the brackets make rebukeable. Nonetheless, if
                        left unquestioned they may work their way into the reader’s (or into
                        another editor’s) mind to define a possible ambiguity that should be
                        kept intact. Again, both E and B supply a semicolon after
                        "shining," 18:par. 65 (which becomes a period in the
                        Erdman/Stevenson edition), but the only point Blake supplies in this context
                        is the comma after "sun," which not only separates "sun"
                        from "black" and "shining" but also intimates that these
                        adjectives should adhere with no further break to the "round it were
                        fiery tracks" following, a relation warranted by the blackness which
                        later rolls through the deep after coming from between the black and white
                        spiders who are revolving on the tracks. In effect, the comma which Blake
                        did supply is compromised by the semicolon he did not, and, again,
                        modernizing editors are led to accept a syntactical relationship opposed to
                        that which the poet not only provided, but might have meant to provide.
                        Comparable semicolons questionably resolving ambiguities appear in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (M) a:22, where the semicolon after
                        "Cherubim" supposes that the "victims" are sacrificing
                        the Cherubim, a reading inferentially at cross purposes with M f:15, where
                        the "Females prepare the Victims." The comma which Stevenson
                        supplies after "Sacrifice" seems preferable, if any point is
                        needed.</p>
          <p>M a:4’s "Woven" is followed by a semicolon in B, while E
                        places a period before it. A likely inference is that no punctuation would
                        best aid the reader when editors so sparing of their points and changes
                        differ so radically about the syntactical relation of the word. Again, even
                        tentative punctuation becomes a species of editorializing a meaning rather
                        than aiding the reader towards a correct understanding of Blake’s
                        intention here. M 20:56— both B and E suppose an apostrophe after
                        "Witnesses," a crucial supposition, particularly since it denies
                        Blake the comma he apparently had placed here for a usual purpose in his
                        practice: to introduce a quoted (or implicitly quoted) statement. Taken with
                        the fact that Blake seldom provides possessive apostrophes, such practice
                        suggests that the mark should be read as the comma it looks like. It can
                        then introduce the lines following (57-58) which probably should be read as
                        the "cries of the Churches," with or without the consequent
                        punctuation which B perhaps misleadingly supplies. Contiguity and an
                        understanding of Blake’s irony at this juncture will make the reading
                        of the point as a comma preferable to some, even to more than some if the
                        point is allowed to stand as and where Blake made it.</p>
          <p>M 3:25 and <hi rend="i">passim</hi>—Seven times in six plates Blake
                        admonishes: "Mark well my words! they are of your eternal
                        salvation." There is almost no correlation among the points used in the
                        same place from one reiteration to another. Nor does there seem to be any
                        editorial consistency in either following or providing punctuation, with the
                        most notable instance of such discrepancy evident in the two places where
                        Blake does point the line the same <pb id="p14-152" n="152"/> way by
                        supplying nothing at all. But B puts an exclamation after
                        "salvation" in a:20, a period after "salvation" in 7:7.
                        Why? I doubt whether an acceptable rationale can be found, except one based
                        in the precedent found in Blake’s own utter lack of concern for what
                        points he used from context to context. But to that precedent there is no
                        end of consequences, even to abolishing altogether the need for any attempt
                        at providing such "aids" for the modern reader. What one does find
                        highlighted here is the previously noted limits of B’s bracketed
                        punctuation. Since he can only provide points where there are either periods
                        or no points at all, he must be content to let punctuation stand which he
                        probably would not prefer if his editorial principles had not bound him to a
                        species of syntactical inconsistency. Again, while it might have been better
                        to have left the <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> drafts as unpointed as Blake
                        wrote them, the points that are supplied should probably be those that Blake
                        used (or B supplied) in the etched versions. E.g., if B reads an exclamation
                        (it may well be a colon) after "Dream" (1) in the illuminated
                        "The Angel," why not supply that inferable Blakean pointing in the
                        draft rather than supply a comma? The likely answer may well suggest the
                        bibliographical weakness of the principle behind it, or at least a
                        descrepancy between the effect of following the principle and of following
                        Blake. The principle is to aid the modern reader according to his
                        expectations in a given context. But the given context for Blake ultimately
                        fulfilled <hi rend="i">his</hi> expectation by providing <hi rend="i">his</hi> emphasis (or syntactical division), which the modern reader
                        must (and really does) accommodate. However, in fairness, I should note that
                        B generally does supply in the <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> the pointing he
                        either finds or provides in the etched texts of the <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> poems.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Thel</hi>, 88—"And says" is followed by a
                        semicolon; in 93 "and said" is followed by a period. B can,
                        according to his principles, bring the period into line with modern
                        expectations by providing a colon to introduce what was said in 93, though
                        he cannot do that in 1. 88 because Blake has, with characteristic
                        inconsistency, introduced a comparable locution by a point other than a dot.
                        The incongruity is apparent in contiguous contexts, but since
                        "says" and "saids" etc. are followed by all manner of
                        pointing <hi rend="i">passim</hi>, why bother cleaning up an occasional spot
                        when the overall result only makes the mess left untouched all the more
                        conspicuous? <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> 3:21 reads "That cause at length
                        mov’d Milton to this unexampled deed" in copy A, but, as B
                        notes, was mended in the copper to "What cause" for copies B-D. B
                        chooses to accept the original "That" over the copper emendation
                        and therefore supplies a period at the end of the clause, where Blake had
                        supplied nothing at all. E, whose preference in this instance seems
                        preferable to B’s, prefers the copper emendation and so concludes
                        with a question mark (unbracketed). Even if "That" is preferred,
                        it would seem that Blake’s no-punctuation at line’s end is
                        better than anything supplied. Perhaps a comma would aid the reader a bit;
                        the period supplied by B may obscure a connection between this line and what
                        follows which Blake may care to intimate.</p>
          <p>M 20:7, 9—The only discernible difference between the colon B reads in
                        7 and the semicolon he reads in 9 is that the first may seem to have a
                        slightly smaller lower dot (though in "B" even that distinction
                        seems missing). As a general rule, B implicitly accepts the fuller bottom
                        dot as the sign of the comma which makes a semicolon in such cases, though
                        this principle, relative at best, seems variably defined and applied from
                        context to context. Size differences between dots vary in different
                        contexts. And the alternative criteria of rhetorical suggestiveness and
                        modern desirability may tend to jaundice the eye somewhat so that it sees
                        what best fits the apparent needs of a given syntax. On occasion, these
                        inferable rules of thumb may contravene each other—e.g., the larger
                        dot in 11 (M 20) is at the top, but B nods in favor of a modern tendency to
                        place a semicolon before anti-thetical "but" clauses, perhaps
                        gaining the slimmest warrant from a nearly discernible directional signal
                        which may be protuding comma-wise from the base of the lower and smaller
                        dot. Likewise, B (as E) has both context and modern usage on his side when
                        he overlooks the relatively adequate comma potential observable even in copy
                        B (more so in A) to read the lower dot as forming a colon after
                        "remain," 20. Both B and E regularly accept a colon whose upper
                        dot is a bit higher on the page, and so more widely separated from its mate
                        below, as an implicit vertical forming an exclamation mark, when the context
                        or their sense of Blake’s rather expansive use of such tonal emphases
                        aids at filling in the requisite part of the empty space between. E tends to
                        opt for the shriek mark more often than B when such options are available.
                        Witness M 20:29, where E’s exclamations are reduced to the colons
                        which B’s copytext (and copy A as well) more nearly portray.
                        Arguably, the "high colon" may indicate a faulty imprint which an
                        editor is justified in filling in. Arguments the other way are obvious
                        enough. Sometimes a slight teardrop effect becomes a vertical for
                        exclamatory purposes when the context cries for one to modern
                        ears—"Awake Albion awake!" (M 22:5)—however unclear
                        it is that Blake necessarily preferred exclamations to colons in such
                        cases—either in practice or in theory. The apt Blakean comment on a
                        good many of these and kindred inferences from the problematically intense
                        inane may be found in the happily unpunctuated ambiguity of "what we
                        hope we see." Another fairly common version of the exclamation mark is
                        one in which the dot actually appears to be a comma. Most likely this simply
                        means that Blake was negligent (though he does tell us that, however absurd
                        he thinks nonsense about dots is, he knows how to make them), as he is in
                        reverse when he provides periods rather than apostrophes to indicate
                        elisions etc. M 12:27 provides an equivocal case in point, where a dot
                        provides E with "earth’s" and B with "earths,"
                        probably because the context does not require a possessive and the dot may
                        therefore be supposed an accident. In impressions where there is evidence
                        that the imprint of the point did not take, one may check other copies not
                        only to see whether high colons are properly read as exclamations because
                        the upper dot has in fact expanded to a vertical but even to see whether a
                        healthy, fully-rounded dot in the best copies has not been partially
                        eclipsed in its lower half so that a quarter-mooned comma tail appears in
                        inferior impressions.</p>
          <p>M 20:19—In keeping with a general policy of <pb id="p14-153" n="153"/>
                        not supplying any point at line’s end when the next line begins with
                        a coordinating conjunction, B has none after "permanent." E not
                        only has a period here but provides it unbracketed, indicating that he had
                        seen it in his copytext. Neither copy A nor B has anything here, so, if
                        E’s reading is not a mistake, then another copy may provide what
                        these two do not. There are of course a great many such discrepancies. And
                        this may not be the best of many possible examples but it should serve to
                        indicate the need for establishing a best or consensus text, even to the
                        given point, and letting the reader know what the evidence and the reasoning
                        are that went into an editorial preference when (apparently) equally
                        definitive alternatives are available. Without belaboring another kind of
                        point which may be extraneous here, isn’t the time at hand when
                        computer calculations about Blake’s multitudinous
                        "copytexts" for a given work and the "vagaries" of his
                        pointing can be made, collated, and inferred from, even if the end result is
                        at best merely a higher degree of correlation between the point preferred by
                        the editor and the one which Blake most likely etched?</p>
          <p>"Earth’s Answer," 7—the supplied semicolon arbitrates
                        an ambiguity by associating "Cold and Hoar" with "I,"
                        when it may well belong to "den" or "Jealousy." In the
                            <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> draft, B supplies a comma, which may indicate
                        some lessening assurance about what the adjectives are meant to qualify.
                        "Does the sower?" (18) may suggest a heavy rhetorical emphasis by
                        intruding a (rationally) redundant question mark in the midst of a sentence.
                        It is possible—particularly if Blake etched his end-line points after
                        he etched the text—that this rather poorly formed point was
                        implicitly aborted when Blake realized he wanted it to go after
                        "night" below.</p>
          <p>M 22:36—B catches a dot after "Albion" which E misses; but E
                        notes one after "Watch-Fiends," 40, which B misses or ignores.
                        Always, there is the question of alternative copy texts which may justify
                        opposed readings. The colon after "seems," M 26:45 is so clearly
                        there in copies A and B that one is tempted to infer that another copytext,
                        lacking the point, eliminated it from E’s syntax.</p>
          <p>M 27:54-5—The clear dot after "Month" is apparently read (by
                        B—E sees a comma) as if it were over the "i" of
                        "invulnerable" below. It is really too far up and to the right to
                        do that service, given the available option. The clear dot (read as a comma
                        by both B and E) after "Year" provides a parallel by way of
                        confirmation. It would be tempting, though misleading, to suppose that Blake
                        provided periods here, not elsewhere in the series, to suggest the elision
                        of the verb. But Blake’s pointing of any given series is a mixed bag
                        of dots and commas throughout, with no apparent differentiating function,
                        rhetorical or normative. (See, e.g., 27:33-34; 28:49.) In M 9:37 positioning
                        suggests an opposite inference about a dot’s purpose. The period B
                        reads after "Palamabron" really (as E must infer) dots the first
                        "i" of "Elynittria" in 38. The problem is (as the second
                        "i" demonstrates) that Blake dots his i’s with about as
                        much consistency as he points his series.</p>
          <p>VDA 134—B’s copytext does not have the question mark he places
                        after "lust"; it may, both in that and other copies, have the
                        exclamation mark which E provides, but it looks most like what in context it
                        may best be read as—a colon. In M 19:50 the barest hint of a question
                        mark has allowed B and E to perceive it into place as the context may seem
                        to need it, though a colon, an exclamation, or a semicolon would be more the
                        computer’s view of the mark Blake made after "repentance."
                        Often the best choice may well seem "None of the above,"
                        particularly when he has created an impossible hybrid by placing a comma
                        under a vertical (VDA 187 provides a good example, visible even in <hi rend="i">The Illuminated Blake</hi>).</p>
          <p>M 24:15—At times B seems to make the choice Blake should have made. As
                        E notes, it is a semicolon at line’s end, but the context of colons
                        which make up this catalogue of parallels seems to justify B against the
                        strict demands of the point as Blake made it, however he meant it. And does
                        Blake mean the distinctions his editors rightly note in such cases? In M
                        17:46-59 <hi rend="i">passim</hi>, B and E often disagree on whether a point
                        is a colon or an exclamation mark. Here, as generally, B is less likely to
                        take advantage of a highly placed top dot or a slight projection from it
                        towards the vertical, whereas E, who may after all be more sympathetic to
                        the rhetorical demands of the sigla, is abundant with exclamations.</p>
          <p>M 17:55—Given "A," E is preferable with a comma after
                        "fibres," but "B" tends to justify B’s
                        period.</p>
          <p>M11:40—The apostrophe in "namd" which both B and E
                        apparently saw is not really there in copies A or B, though these copies do
                        show one over the "e" in "toned" (not recorded by B) in
                        11:47. Given the comparable accent to indicate a pronounced "-ed"
                        in "used," one may wonder whether Blake wanted the extra syllable
                        pronounced where he did not so indicate. But a typical lack of consistency
                        in such matters may be inferred from the "shudder’d" of M
                        12:33 and the "shudderd" two lines later.</p>
          <p>M 14:21—B and E agree in not seeing a comma after
                        "everything," perhaps because it is partly obscured by the
                        "E" of "Eternity" below, perhaps because it separates
                        subject and verb. Such pointing could have its rhetorical purpose. More
                        anomalous is the comma which E places after "loud," 14:45, but no
                        copytext I’ve seen justifies it, nor does B confirm it.</p>
          <p>M 22:61—An atypical example of B preferring the exclamation mark, E
                        the period, in a context where they both felt some point should be supplied.
                        M 10:24 is more typical, where the colon B seems properly to see and place
                        after "Jehovah thunder’d above" becomes an exclamation for
                        E. Four lines above E agrees with B in seeing a colon after the same
                        locution. While "Ecce signum" may be too often the cry of the
                        blinkered textual fundamentalist, it may be at least an appropriate reminder
                        now and then leveled at an editor prone to reading the spaces between the
                        dots where, in Blake, contexts elsewhere seeming to demand an exclamatory
                        emphasis are low-keyed by a mere period or even an indifferent comma.</p>
          <p>M 6:47—Both B and E read a comma here, probably because they would
                        rather not break up the sentence <pb id="p14-154" n="154"/> after
                        "Truth," but a speculative reader straining to justify
                        Blake’s perhaps unjustifiable practice may support the clear period
                        the poet put here by suggesting that its purpose is to establish a kind of
                        enclitic emphasis for "Truth" which a terminal
                        point—particularly if it is understood as having no <hi rend="i">syntactical</hi> justification—may provide. The same inference
                        may be applied to "Lie" in the line following. Admittedly such an
                        inference will have a limited application and must be allowed even within
                        such limits in the face of the conflicting and more easily demonstrable
                        inference that Blake let his points fall into shape as arbitrarily as the
                        chips from his copperplate defined them into dots or commas, colons or
                        semicolons. In 27:49-51, 55-56, Blake demonstrates that he will, though
                        rarely, place periods at line’s end before the conjunction
                        "And" when it introduces a clause. B, who does not typically
                        supply points in such cases, changes all but one of these to semicolons.
                        But, while this may provide some (really unnecessary) aid and comfort to the
                        modern reader because it falls in more neatly with modern syntactical
                        groomings, may it not for that very reason dissipate a rhetorical intention
                        that Blake might have felt and conditioned Blake readers may infer? Again, I
                        do not mean this as a criticism of B on principle—we can remove his
                        italics and restore Blake’s periods as we go—but I do suggest
                        that where these changes or supplyings are not really necessary, where they
                        arbitrate ambiguities better left to the reader’s discrimination of
                        relationships, or where they may lead a reader away from a rhetorical effect
                        plausibly inferred, they represent a dubious editorial intrusion, because
                        they do, however tentatively, represent an editorial authority. The crucial
                        editorial judgment involved must decide whether suggested punctuation is not
                        misleading punctuation.</p>
          <p>VDA, 114, exemplifies the necessary contradiction often involved in trying to
                        read Blake’s points according to the way they look. The exclamation B
                        and E read after "O Urizen" seems more a colon in the British
                        Museum Print Room copies but would gain exclamation status (on the principle
                        of the high colon) in copy E were it not that the required dot at the bottom
                        appears as a perfectly tailed Blakean comma, much more to that point than
                        the one which makes up (for B) the bottom half of a semicolon at the end of
                        this line. One can argue on one hand that "O Urizen" is clearly
                        exclamatory in its tonal suggestiveness, but one must also note that Blake
                        will in comparable passages provide alternative forms of punctuation. Here,
                        a contextual argument could be made for the colon, though, again, Blake
                        could as well have used a semicolon in such a context, as B’s
                        copytext seems to indicate.</p>
          <p>VDA, 122, suggests the infinite because utterly idiosyncratic rhetorical
                        potential of Blake’s pointing: "Does he who contemns poverty,
                        and he who turns with abhorrence / From usury: feel the same passion or are
                        they moved alike?" Had the colon been a period B likely would have
                        removed it on principle. But one wonders—Could Blake have actually
                        menat his colon here, as his dot elsewhere, to indicate a slow-down mark
                        which would have emphasized the opposition he was setting up between the
                        actions and passions of two quite different kinds of people? Of course here
                        as often the point (whatever point) provides for the breathing pause the
                        spoken lines may require. Insofar as Blake may be supposed to provide that
                        kind of rhetorical aid, supplied and omitted pointings tend to withdraw
                        it.</p>
          <p>M 2, 11. 9-12 of the poem—"gold" is followed by a point with
                        a big lower dot which elsewhere B would probably read as a comma (to make a
                        semicolon), particularly since it projects a bit of comma tail as well. But
                        since, as B sees it, all else is colon through here, he no doubt properly
                        goes along with the drift of the context. Even the concluding exclamation
                        (after "fire") is rhetorically apt (though perhaps no more than
                        the three preceding it would be), but its top dot has little (if any) more
                        tendency to a vertical than does the one after "unfold" above.
                        Indeed E sees an exclamation in both places.</p>
          <p>"On Anothers Sorrow," 27. Why supply a semicolon when the context
                        demands, if anything, a period? But this seems another case of rhetorical
                        and rational pointing working at cross purposes. The penultimate stanza here
                        is meticulously effective and, one would like to hope, purposely pointed,
                        whether one accepts B’s periods or E’s commas as
                        Blake’s points after the parallel "Think not"’s of
                        29 and 31. It reads quite beautifully if the pauses of the original
                        punctuation are observed and B’s suggested omissions ignored. The
                        last stanza contains a dot indicating a pause after "joy," which
                        carries with it some of the weight on the exclamation after
                        "0"—and then Blake rushes to the poem’s end without
                        a point to hinder him or the reader. The run-on passage is particularly
                        effective after the slow and balanced cadence of the previous stanza. And so
                        one may wish away the semicolon supplied to break up the flow in 34,
                        particularly since the modern reader could get along without it, on other
                        grounds, as easily as he does in comparable places where B does not provide
                        a point.</p>
          <p>M 23:20—Copy B has a clear dot after "where" which justifies
                        B. In copy A there is nary a dot to be seen, which justifies E, who records
                        none. Since there is also in copy B a dot below the dot transcribed by B we
                        could assume that either we are in this copy presented with a fallen colon
                        or, more likely, that both dots are inadvertent. In either case, the
                        literalist of the text (copy B version) would seem obliged to note both dots
                        as having justifiable reason for being there, or ignore both as kindred
                        accidents. That they are likely accidents can be inferred—and this is
                        the point—by appealing to other copies for arbitration. If the other
                        copies supply the single dot, receive it with B; if not, ignore it with
                        E—and with, I suppose, confirmation from our normative willingness to
                        deny a point in a context where none is needed. (Note, however, that both
                        copies A and B <hi rend="i">do</hi> provide a likely colon before
                        "where," which E and B agree in ignoring.) In another view, one
                        may forage around enough in available copies to come up with a point which
                        may seem better justified by modern expectations than that which exists (or
                        does not exist) in an elected copy text. There may very well be in copy A
                        the comma which makes a comforting appositive out of "Seat of
                        Satan" (before "Seat") in M 24:45 and so E is <pb id="p14-155" n="155"/> justified. But in copy B there is none, so B is
                        justified in not transcribing it.</p>
          <p>As already suggested, it will not always do to let the majority of
                        impressions of a given poem stand as the workable consensus to abide by,
                        since it is often clear that only the minority—perhaps only
                        one—of the impressions have received the fully definitive stamp of
                        Blake’s copper or are free from obscuring coloration, splatters,
                        encroaching tendrils etc., which will at times indeed seem to be just the
                        point one may care to require in a given context. Even within the copy which
                        seems on balance the best available a few points will be found that are less
                        than definitive relative to their reproduction elsewhere. Out of a myriad of
                        instances, one may note that a presumptive dot in the A and B copies of
                        "Garden of Love," 3, after "midst" may tail off into a
                        barely perceptive comma in copy I but evolves more clearly in copy N, which
                        then confirms B here in his choice of a copytext rendition that better shows
                        it as it no doubt was on the copper. Still, one cannot therefore abide in
                        any given set of impressions merely because some or even most will provide
                        less obscured and uncertain pointings, since often a given plate in a
                        relatively superior copy will come a cropper for reasons which must be
                        ascribed to the nature of Blake’s reproductive process and
                        techniques. One may suppose, for instance, that the many flyspecks
                        surrounding and even filling in the gap between the colon after
                        "regale" in "Little Vagabond," 6, required B to confirm
                        the point by reference to a clearer copy than N. Indeed the extraneous
                        mottles and dots on this impression at times make the words themselves
                        nearly illegible (cf. 11. 5-9). Again, since there really is no such thing
                        as a text whose reliability in matters of pointing is necessarily preferable
                        to others extant, the editor must call his dots as he sees them with a
                        counterbalancing pair of principles variably abetted by other
                        considerations: on one hand, the consensus reading; on the other hand, the
                        best text—even the best impression—even the best production of
                        a single point in a given context, where that seems ascertainable.</p>
          <p>The rhetorical license that Blake noted in the quite arbitrary pointings of
                        the editions of Bacon, Swedenborg, and the Bible that he was familiar with
                        could have served as precedent for the rationally frustrating uniqueness of
                        his own practice. But, as often, he went beyond his precedents. It is, for
                        instance, quite possible that he meant to imply a specific rhetorical
                        emphasis when he placed a dot between subject and verb—"One
                        thought. fills immensity." Should any letterpress edition even suggest
                        our omitting it? Or note the effect of the dots as slowdown marks in
                        "Cradle Song," 13-16: <q> Sweet moans. dovelike sighs.<lb/> Chase
                            not slumber from thy eyes.<lb/> Sweet moans. sweeter smiles.<lb/> All
                            the dovelike moans beguile. </q> This is the way B actually read the
                        text (putting aside his italics etc.), and it is a good example of his
                        providing the diplomatic version that E does not, because E is attracted to
                        commas in most such cases, though his eye may indeed see more than his heart
                        knows, as I’d think was likely the case here. There is generally a
                        textual integrity in B’s dottiness that may be preferred to
                        E’s well-meaning accommodation to a modern expectation for something
                        less terminal than the dot <hi rend="i">qua</hi> period implies for the
                        modern reader. As already suggested, perhaps the best editorial expedient is
                        to retain such dots with the reminder to the reader that in Blake they mean
                        "slow"—sometimes "dead slow"—but hardly
                        ever "stop period"; and that their recurrence in a given context
                        after each word (as sometimes happens) merely means that that procession of
                        words should be paced according to the measured emphasis that the
                        poet’s "cadences" thereby imply, whether the dots hint at a
                        comma or keep their roundness unprojected. In "Cradle Song" an
                        excellent comma after "mild," 7, could serve to call into question
                        nearly all the others that a given editor might care to find elsewhere in
                        this context. On the other side of the question, one may note that the dot
                        after "eyes," 14, has as much claim to being a comma as others so
                        designated by both B and E, here and elsewhere. But, since it may seem that
                        every dot has a comma inside awaiting the editor who needs it, it is perhaps
                        as well that editorial consensus compensate for editorial disagreement when
                        the syntax in question is a matter of indifference, <hi rend="i">if</hi> it
                        is here. In "Nurse’s Song" (<hi rend="i">Inn.</hi>), the
                        mark after "play," 7, and "play," 9, is the same, and
                        could perhaps have led B to provide Blake with a consistency in commas or
                        periods which he perhaps aimed at here, though consistency about such jots
                        and tittles was not one of Blake’s hobgoblins, as a collation of the
                        following lines suggests: <q> And their sun does never shine.<lb/> And their
                            fields are bleak and bare.<lb/> And their ways are fill’d with
                            thorns.<lb/> (B sees no point here.)<lb/> It is eternal winter
                            there.<lb/> ("Holy Thursday," <hi rend="i">Exp.</hi>
                            9-12)<lb/><lb/> And I wept both night and day<lb/> And he wip’d
                            my tears away<lb/> And I wept both day and night<lb/> And hid from him
                            my hearts delight<lb/> ("The Angel," 5-9) </q> One may perhaps
                        argue for different rhetorical intentions in the two passages, but the
                        argument would have to gain most of its substance from the ingenuity of its
                        advocate, since Blake himself seems blissfully innocent of weight and
                        measure here and quite beyond the nets or needs of rationalization. And
                        discriminating rationale for the present arrangement of dots and no-dots
                        could, if the pointing were reversed, find an esthetic or rhetorical
                        application for the reader intent on binding Blake to a contrary set of
                        insights.</p>
          <p>Besides those already noted, the following substantive and/or typographical

          <p>There are some other queries about substantives which may suggest a need for
                        either change or further comment. M 25:53 is aptly read "The Thor"
                        by B. Nor do I see any Blakean reason for not accepting "The" in
                        this reference to Thor and Odin as opposed to the Gods of Priam and/or
                        Apollo and Hercules. But since the reading has been seriously questioned by
                        editors whose scrupulosity B praises, we should perhaps have a word noting
                        their preference here. J 89:26 "flocks" is "Rocks" in E;
                        again, a significant disagreement deserves a note, perhaps a justification
                        of preference. Generally the alternatives "spake" and
                        "spoke" are either used indiscriminately by Blake or they are all
                        meant to be "spoke." A word on "a" and "o" in
                        Blake would not be amiss, since his o’s very often look like
                        a’s when it is clear they cannot be. B generally does provide
                        comments on E’s recoveries from apparently blank spaces or illegible
                        blots and scribbles—often cogently, given the evidence adduced, e.g.,
                        MHH par. 20 (on "the Devil"). Blake’s caps are often hard
                        to discriminate from his lower case initial letters—B and E often
                        disagree about them—but when the context backs the look of the letter
                        (consider "Stars" for B’s "stars" M 22:24)
                        consistency is probably the best editorial policy, even if it is not often
                        Blake’s (the "Spoke" so capped by B in M 23:43 seems much
                        less deserving of the distinction). There is also much disagreement and
                        perhaps some inconsistency in reading the expanded spaces Blake sometimes
                        placed (purposely or not) between his lines. See, e.g., M 19:11, M 23:66, J
                        30:32, J 40:51. These are the kinds of errors and discordances which an
                        edition of this magnitude and complexity may seem inevitably to fall victim
                        to. It could make one wish that highly significant and ideally definitive
                        editions such as this one could receive the kind of widespread and critical
                        reviewing in page proofs that they will as inevitably receive once the book
                        has passed into the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Manuscript disagreements and apparent errors are often more difficult to
                        arbitrate because of the state of the mss, often chaotic, often palimpsestic
                        in appearance. <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> 49, 51 (1060B), "our" is
                        probably "your." 51N has some erased lines at the top which E
                        recovers and B discounts as illegible. The recovery seems reasonable, given
                        the equipment and persistence we know E brings to such a task, and probably
                        should have been noted for the reader’s consideration. Both B and E
                        read "whitlors" for Keynes’ "whitloes" on 61N
                        (1039B). The OED lists no "whitlors" but it does note that
                        "whitloe" (a variant of "whitlow") means a finger tumor,
                        which is very likely what Blake is ascribing to the poor painters he is
                        referring to. For comparable "-es" endings see the two
                        "theres" on this page ("alludes" on 79N is still
                        closer); nor did Blake typically make his "r" as this one would
                        have to be (see "Booksellers" and "Dealers" below, 61N).
                        Since "whitlors" also appears in the <hi rend="i">Concordance</hi>, it may be that a typographical error was the original of
                        this reading. E’s "turnd on" seems preferable to B’s
                        "turned upon" 84N (1020B). Were it not that B’s
                        "night" of 67N (967B) looks very much like a definite
                        "might" at the start of this poem, both its loops and context
                        would make his reading preferable to E’s. In 99N, E’s
                        "opened" seems preferable to B’s "opend" (970B).
                        In 103N, E’s "whereer" ("Holy Thursday," 13-14)
                        accommodates better to the number of cursive strokes available than does
                        B’s "wherever" (976), as it better accords with the metre
                        and with the etched version. B’s "flourishing" (105N, poem
                        40E), may be preferable to E’s "flaming," but it looks to
                        me more like "flowery" written over "flowering," with
                        the "hair" following perhaps mended from "head" (978B).
                        A few lines later, no question that the "The" B queries in his
                        footnote was deleted. However, in 106N, "his little coat" (B)
                        seems closer to Blake’s script than "the little coat" (E)
                        (981B). 114N’s "Dreaming o’er" (E) seems justified
                        by the "o’er" a bit later over B’s "Dreaming
                        of" (998). 115N, for E’s "compelld" I prefer
                        B’s "compeld" (1001B); 116N, for B’s
                        "Reformation of" I read "reformation by"; (1003B); 119N,
                        for B’s "are as follows" I see E’s "are as
                        follow" (1006B).</p>
          <p>In <hi rend="i">Vala</hi>, p. 3, 1. 12, "Individual" was
                        accidentally omitted before "[Man <hi rend="i">del</hi>]". V 8:6:
                        B seems correctly to retain "fierce" and delete bright," a
                        decision reversed by E, who nonetheless accepts a comparable—and
                        perhaps confirming—change in V 9:36. V 9:8 reads "Deep"
                        (B), not "dark" (E), though the cap is doubtful. V 23:10, it is
                        pretty clear that, as E records it, Blake meant to retain the words which B
                        deletes. V 25:13, "the" (E) is preferable to "this" (B),
                        as the other "The"’s in this insertion indicate.</p>
          <p>In the Watson "Marginalia," 1405, B notes that Blake wrote
                        "Hipocrisy" in his Lavater notes, 1365, but there B transcribes
                        "Hypocrisy." On the Watson titlepage verso, Blake seems actually
                        to have written "is is not so," perhaps meaning "it is,"
                        as B transcribes it, but could be a scribal redundancy; "attacked by
                        Paine" should probably read "attackd," as it does in the <hi rend="i">Concordance.</hi> The supplied "[are the . . . ]"
                        should probably be reduced to a supplied comma—as the context
                        indicates, Blake is being elliptical here as a matter of expediency and
                        rhetorical form. There seems no need to modernize "Fals[e]hood" so
                        (1406, 1408); the spelling without the "e" was both common and
                        Blakean. Since B caps "Is," why not in consistency cap
                        "blush" after the next supplied question mark (1406)?
                        "Conscience . . . Locke," at the bottom of p. 2, should probably
                        be followed by "If Conscience is not" etc. Blake had no space for
                        it at the bottom of p. 2, so put it at the top of p. 3 (1407-08). The capped
                        "ON ALL OCCASIONS ACT RIGHT" should be preceded by an asterisk,
                        indicating its specific relation to the asterisked comment following (1408).
                        "Princip[le] another" should appear so; i.e., "le" was
                        not written out (1408). "Can any man who writes ?ill so pretend"
                        may better indicate what Blake wrote in the comment at the top of 1415. The
                        "?ill" is written over the catchword "Let" and may in
                        fact be an aborted "illiberally." The two paragraphs of
                        exasperated comments about the "Public RECORDS" (1418) are in a
                        scrawl rather larger and more hasty than the hand which fills most of these
                        margins, and so suggest a <pb id="p14-157" n="157"/><figure><head>J. K. Lavater.</head><figDesc><hi rend="i">Aphorisms On Man</hi>, page 169. Reprinted with
                                permission from the Huntington Library.</figDesc></figure> different time of composition and state of mind. On 1420
                        (Blake’s p. 29) the same hand sets in with comparable vehemence on
                        the same subject. The hand recurs from Watson 35 ff. <hi rend="i">passim.</hi> I mention this in passing as a possible aid to dating.
                        B’s supplied exclamation in "a Question [!] Downright
                        Plain" (1420) probably separates "Question" from the words
                        that modify it—another instance of misleading editorializing. For
                        "Does he cast them off," 1423, read "does he not cast them
                        off." In Lavater, Blake seems to have written "&amp;c," as E
                        reads it, not "v" as B transcribes it (1374 and note). I tend to
                        side with E (as against B and Keynes) in supposing that the
                        "Admirable" on 1352 is not Blake’s, and I agree with him
                        altogether that "No fumbler kisses" (1374) is not in
                        Blake’s hand, so far as I’ve seen it: neither the slant nor
                        the double-s seems characteristic. While Keynes prints both annotations in
                        the Nonesuch edition B refers to, he excludes "No fumbler kisses"
                        and queries "Admirable" in his later Oxford editions.</p>
          <p>There are as well a few notes and queries about the printed Blake works.
                        Generally B accepts the changes made in various copies of <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi>, though not the "his" for
                        "her," "Song," 16, 757, which nonetheless seems
                        justified by the context, as in his Notes B seems to allow. The
                        "ere" in <hi rend="i">King Edward the Third</hi>, Sc. [iii], 10,
                        1783, should probably be retained because it makes good sense in the context
                        and is not changed in any of the copies. Whatever sanction Blake’s
                        sometime omission of the apostrophe may provide to justify B’s
                        "e’er" seems overruled on both bibliographical and
                        interpretive grounds. In the "Descriptive Catalogue," "How
                        should he? he who," 827 note, should probably have been retained in the
                        body of the text for the rhetorical emphasis Blake probably meant to suggest
                        by it. B apparently assumes a printer’s error rather than
                        Blake’s copy for the semicolon he replaces with a comma on 832 (and
                        note). This semicolon could have had contemporary warrant and is certainly
                        no more anomalous than others B is forced, on principle, to retain in other
                        contexts. A comparable change is made on 851, though, in a rhetorical piece
                        such as this, the semicolon may be apt. Throughout B has a tendency to
                        supply the text with questionmarks which do not, at least in their
                        perfunctory and rational appearance, suggest Blake’s practice. The
                        questionmark provided on 845 could better have been an exclamation, while
                        the change from exclamation to questionmark on 848 heavily qualifies the
                        effect Blake seems to have aimed at with his introductory "0." In
                        the "marginalia" to Thornton, Blake offers a suggestive aphorism
                        about his rhetorical practice which may well justify B in retaining in his
                        text disagreements in number which he will (as in the "Descriptive
                        Catalogue" errata list) elsewhere note: "The Greek &amp; Roman
                        Classics is the Antichrist I say Is &amp; not Are as the most expressive
                        &amp; correct too." This clarified use of a rhetorical grammar should
                        probably be kept in mind by editors wending their way through the rational
                        solecisms of Blake’s syntax at large. The Thornton marginalia would
                        likely come into clearer perspective with closer study than it seems so far
                        to have received. In a brief glance at it, I note that "but [his] /
                        Satans / Will / who is" seems rather to be "but [his will who is]
                        / Satan’s who is . . . " (1516). In the "French
                        Revolution," the change of "war-living" to "war,
                        living" (or "war—living") in line 283 really has no
                        justification and manages to dismantle an effective compound adjective in
                        the process.</p>
          <p>B’s ordering within and among the texts may have both its problems and
                        its merits. He must of course abrograte the page order of the <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> in order to print "The Vision of the Last
                        Judgment," the "Public Address," and "The Everlasting
                        Gospel" integrated pretty much in the order Blake probably meant for
                        them. But individual pages within the <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> will
                        continue to provide grounds for a reconsideration of a given order. In this
                        version of "I saw a Monk of Charlemaine" Blake might have meant
                        the three stanzas on Voltaire and Gibbon to serve as a kind of integrating
                        refrain or chorus meant to appear at different parts of the poem rather than
                        as variants of each other best placed one after the other, as B has them.
                        The passages seem more to gloss reciprocally or progressively rather than to
                        replace each other, as B suggests (928 note); the 1. 7 change from <pb id="p14-158" n="158"/> "barons bold" to "Learning
                        rolld" would have a valid rhetorical rather than a possible esthetic
                        justification if such an inference were preferred. The marginal placing of
                        the passages may indicate that Blake intended them for distribution here and
                        there within the poem, but as B notes, there is no certain indicator of
                        where, and it may be that any editorial arbitration other than that
                        suggested by B would be a hazardous presumption. Still, it is worth noting
                        that contiguity alone was all the indication Blake relied on to place
                        comparable marginal inserts on pp. 54 and 98. B seems correct in reading the
                        line through "For the tear is an intellectual thing" as a
                        separation rather than deletion line. The lead-in catch phrase, "A tear
                        is an &amp;c," seems to confirm the inference and the order. Another
                        positive use of a comparable phrase appears in the insertion of the
                        "Raphael Sublime" couplets (<hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> p. 39)
                        after "Raphael Sublime &amp;c" p. 1 "Public Address"
                        (1029). It might have been preferable if B had taken advantage of yet
                        another such cue, "Was Jesus Chaste or did he &amp;c" (p. 54), to
                        supply the appropriate passage from p. 48 where Blake apparently wanted it.
                        It would probably have aided the reader if B had been more forthcoming about
                        reorderings which may well be justified but are not obviously
                        so—e.g., the separation of "Commerce is so far" etc. (1037)
                        from the preceding part of its page (57), also concerned with Commerce, that
                        B places on 1034. Other problem pages whose ordering in B may deserve
                        rethinking include 62, 66, 67, 92.</p>
          <p>On p. 76, the context and the separating diagonal indicate that "Ishmael
                        is Mahomet" should be placed before, not after, the interpolated
                        "Abel kneels" etc. On p. 81, "at their head" should
                        probably come before "little infants," which in fact the logic of
                        the caret and its insert suggests. "The Aged Woman is Britannica"
                        etc. should likely follow "began," as the final recension of
                        Jerusalem etc. which is deleted in the margin. This does bring about the
                        interesting but not unblakean division of Jerusalem (as the bride of Albion)
                        into the Aged Woman and her daughter. That relatively characteristic anomaly
                        may be preferable to an ordering which would somehow place the Aged
                        Britannica, who is the aged wife, at her own head, since she is one of the
                        referents of "their" in "at their head" as B (and E)
                        receive it. I would also suggest, on the same page, that the internal logic
                        of the description would be tighter if "The Aged Figure . . . Oaks of
                        Albion" passage to the right of the emblem were placed <hi rend="i">after</hi> "coming in the Clouds." Blake first describes what
                        is above Noah, then what is around and beneath him, and finally adds the
                        description of the "Aged Figure" who is taking account of the
                        "various figures Risen into the Air." The progression on p. 82
                        seems to support such an ordering. Blake wrote down the left side of the
                        emblem until he could write across the entire page. I.e., he did not go
                        first to the right of the emblem and then to the bottom of the page. B
                        provides more or less justifiable orderings in the illuminated works which
                        will at times make it a little harder to use his text with the <hi rend="i">Concordance</hi> and with references to the Erdman and Keynes editions.
                        Doubtless certain of his decisions will be queried—whether he has
                        rightly placed the conclusion of the Natural Religion plates, whether in
                        Vala he has correctly ordered 12:26-29—whether indeed a strictly
                        chronological ordering of the canon itself is preferable to, e.g., a
                        thematic approach such as E uses, or to what extent such an ordering can be
                        strict. Personally, I prefer <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> VIIb in context rather
                        than in an appendix, and so prefer B to E in this idea of order from both an
                        esthetic and bibliographical standpoint. At times, however, B’s
                        bibliographical assumptions do not seem cogent, even when his conclusions
                        may be warranted. E.g., in his discussion of the plate order for MHH (694) B
                        supposes that the order for copy G is only a temporary aberration from a
                        conventional order, used in all clearly authoritative copies other than G
                        and specifically reaffirmed by copy I which must have come after G because
                        of its 1825 watermark. But an 1815 watermark hardly precludes a post 1825
                        date for what appears on its paper and the fact that Blake numbered the
                        pages may seem to give his authority to the order when only one (perhaps
                        two) copies can be placed in opposition to it. I am not so much denying the
                        consensus likelihood of the order in copy I as I am questioning the
                        assumptions which attempt to establish the order beyond valid argument to
                        the contrary. If B’s conjecture that copies G and I were both colored
                        about 1827 is correct—because of their similarity—there may be
                        good reason in that alone to assign equal authority to the copy G ordering,
                        particularly if one also assumes that the G numbering was done at the same
                        time. The question then may be whether the G order is not actually
                        preferable because it represents what may very well be Blake’s
                        latest—not simply a late repetition of his earliest—thoughts
                        on ordering. One may then precede to the no doubt dubious but still, in its
                        degree, valid argument from internal evidence: Is there any reason inferable
                        from the text for Blake to have finally preferred the G order? Perhaps worth
                        pondering.</p>
          <p>As noted, the design reproductions are roughly comparable in quality to those
                        in <hi rend="i">The Illuminated Blake</hi>, perhaps better on balance, worse
                        in a few obvious instances (e.g., MHH 1, 10, 16, 24, J 99, 100). One misses
                        the colors but must be pleased with a readable text pictorially supplemented
                        as Blake designed it to be. B himself provides a verbal supplement to the
                        designs which highlights what we can see well enough anyway but B sometimes
                        misses what may be less apparent or perhaps only apparent in a copy other
                        than the one which B chooses to reproduce and describe. There is nothing
                        here like the detailed rumination which E provides, partly at least because
                        interpretive analysis would not accord well with B’s editorial
                        principles. It is not always clear whether a given description applies to
                        the reproduction, to the copytext (they are not usually the same), or to a
                        representative text which may not be either. For instance, while the
                        copytext does depict a "Black boy" in "Chimney Sweep"
                            (<hi rend="i">Exp.</hi>), the boy in the reproduction is white-faced,
                        while in some variants (such as copy A) his hair looks like Tom
                        Dacre’s before it was shorn. As this last suggests, the space used
                        for merely describing what we can see may be—perhaps sometimes
                        is—better used to tell us all we need to know about significant
                        variants. The VDA reproductions and commentary make up a particularly
                        convenient case in point because B used the same copy (E) for the copytext
                        and the designs. While B does discriminate five figures <pb id="p14-159" n="159"/> in plate 2’s rainbow (I can only find four), he does
                        not note the humanoid potential of the two rocks in the lower right. Nor,
                        under Variants, does he note that in copy O, apparently the most worked over
                        and clarified of the copies, the rocks not only take on the human form
                        distinguishable but provide a pictorial reprise of the Theotormon figure of
                        the frontispiece, his head buried in his arm. The other figure, bending over
                        at the waist with hair and arms hanging limply down, would then seem to be
                        Oothoon. Such appearances should be saved, even if they do not appear on
                        representative impressions, particularly since here they indicate the object
                        of the conjuror figure’s attentions. He is, in effect (isn’t
                        he?), converting the "Human Form Divine" into "Shapeless
                        Rocks." At least the reader should be allowed the possibility of making
                        that inference. In plate 3, under verbal variants, B notes "Three
                        obscured words to the right of Albion" which should probably be
                        assigned instead to plate 2. B should have reported the variant of plate 4
                        in copy C which shows the spread-winged (or -armed) figure rising up behind
                        the woman dreaming on the cloud. Or, if he felt the variant form apocryphal,
                        he should have noted and explained such an inference. While copy E does
                        suggest the possibility that the woman in plate 8 is wearing a "long
                        skirt," several other perhaps more representative copies suggest the
                        more likely possibility (given the text) that she is covered by bedclothes.
                        Nor does copy E show as clearly as copy O the plate 10 fourth figure that B
                        is uncertain about. Its fingers are well defined in copy O. Presumably this
                        copy—the Robinson copy—is one of the latest. Since, along with
                        another late copy (P), it contains the more clearly humanized and defined
                        figures, couldn’t a strong argument be made in favor of preferring it
                        as the basis for deciding on Blake’s latest and best pictorial
                        intentions in VDA? Retrospectively, it may indicate what Blake meant to
                        suggest by less obvious symbolic impressions in other copies. (I am myself
                        convinced that plate 7 of copy O defines the Contours of Theotormon’s
                        hair into a profile of Bromion’s head which looks up at Oothoon and
                        effectively illuminates her lament that none but Bromion can hear her
                        words.)</p>
          <p>The congenital ambiguity inherited from the originating copper and cloned
                        into the various impressions of a given work may at once defy and justify
                        editorial judgments. As already suggested, such ambiguity can be as much
                        compounded as resolved by the choice of copytext, partly because the elected
                        text may show plate to plate variations in quality that makes an overall
                        reliance on it at best a calculated risk. B states that he
                        "normally" chooses his "copy texts where the etched text is
                        clear, uncoloured, and not clarified by hand," with specific priority
                        given to posthumous copies because they reflect the last state to which
                        Blake brought his coppers and can be seen "unaffected by colouring or
                        changes of mind in the process of printing or correcting." Since <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> copy B is neither the latest nor an uncolored copy,
                        it is not clear why B preferred it, nor indeed is it clear, in substantive
                        matters at least, that he typically did prefer it when alternative copies
                        provided other readings.</p>
          <p>Generally speaking, B seems to opt for the unmended readings wherever they
                        may appear. Although in M 3:21, copies B-D contain the mended copper reading
                        "What" as Blake’s latest (some may feel best) choice, B
                        prefers "That" from copy A. Likewise, to have preferred his
                        copytext (and copies C and D) to copy A in M 24:60 would have eliminated a
                        line which to most readers might seem necessary. However, if the erasure of
                        the line is Blake’s, it would seem that his last intention was to
                        omit it. A comparable—or seeming—attempt in copy B at erasing
                        a grammatically unwarranted "s" in "sweets" M 31:46 goes
                        unheeded and unnoted, and, given Blake’s rhetorical indifference to
                        such matters, may confirm an apparent suspicion that other hands were at
                        work in mending Blake’s impressions to suit another sense of
                        propriety. Kindred mending might have changed M 23:66’s
                        "raving" to "?roaring" in copy B, another change in his
                        copytext which B notes but overrules. B also retains the clause which joins
                        M 4 and M 5 in copy B, though suggests that it might have been eliminated in
                        the copper for the latest printing in copy D. At times the crucial decision
                        may not be so much what Blake’s last intentions were but whether or
                        not they should be accepted as definitive. An ambiguous but well-known case
                        in point involves the restoration of certain words in J 3 which were in the
                        original copper but cannot be justified by an appeal to any copytext
                        impression. B places them in footnotes, along with predictable misgivings
                        about some of E’s recoveries in this context. It probably would have
                        benefited the common reader and would not have discomfited the scholar if
                        the deleted words which B accepts appeared (perhaps in italics) in the body
                        of the text, given the enabling if not identical precedent provided by the
                        inclusions in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> of material later deleted. Perhaps
                        this is the place to suggest that B’s recurrent unwillingness to be
                        convinced by E’s confidence or certainty about his many recoveries of
                        inferences about lost words will receive varying degrees of support from
                        those who follow the hunt through the texts which these editors have
                        scrutinized to see or not to see what Blake might have written. B’s
                        caution may seem to be the ideal complement to E’s sometimes
                        hazardous attempts at rescuing the apparently irretrievable from the outer
                        darkness in which Blake either accidentally or purposely left
                        it—particularly when he in turn supplements his caution by noting
                        E’s readings of what he finds illegible. The reader will thereby know
                        where the cruxes lie and the scholar may then attempt to resolve them when
                        in the presence of the originals containing them.</p>
          <p>A few other problems of copytext may be briefly noted. Given the grammatical
                        idiosyncracies of Blake and his possible precedents—and given his
                        insistence on the exact and exacting cadences of his line—the change
                        from an admittedly troublesome "Why have thou elevate" (J 34:10)
                        to a more easily justified "Why hast thou elevated[?st]" should
                        probably have been made in the footnotes, not in the body of the text. It
                        has no textual authority, and does not seem to correct a scribal (or
                        etching) error. As noted previously, discrepant and perhaps erroneous
                        pointing may result from the use of a copytext which, in a given instance,
                        is misleading. VDA, 60, does indeed have the dot after "hears" as
                        noted by B, but, from among the several copies I’ve seen, it appears
                        only in copy E, and may well be a splotch or anomaly peculiar to that
                        impression alone. <pb id="p14-160" n="160"/> The inference is—and it
                        is elsewhere inferable as well—that something is not necessarily
                        better than nothing if it fails to gain representative support. VDA, 99,
                        concludes with a semicolon for E, nothing at all for B, and, in the British
                        Museum Print Room copies, a colon for me, one which I would diminish either
                        to a dot or comma using only the copy E copy-text that B apparently relies
                        on. But in this instance there is <hi rend="i">something</hi> there, though
                        B likely overlooked or ignored it because in his copytext he could
                        legitimately suppose that the miniscule and faded dot that imprinted from
                        the copper was in fact a part of the rather flaky smudginess which runs up
                        the margin just to the right of the text. A further inference: the copytext
                        here is neither best nor can it be easily seen as representative. The
                        indicated moral: other impressions must be checked and, where they clearly
                        provide better readings, preferred.</p>
          <p>VDA, 165, suggests the need to look around for a "best" text for a
                        given reading when there is some evidence that a specific or even consensus
                        copytext may be at fault. The word "sleep" ending this line is
                        followed by a readily discernible dot in copy E and so B accepts the point
                        as a period. The only copy I’ve checked which clearly justifies
                        E’s colon is copy O because it is only in that copy that the upper
                        dot comes through with any distinction. It is otherwise faded and smudged at
                        best. But since the "p" at the end of "sleep" likewise
                        suffers a noticeable attrition in other copies, the editor doggedly in
                        pursuit of the point Blake made might have been alerted to the need for
                        nosing about for a copy which rounded out a better "p." In copy E
                        the "p" lacks its loop except in the merest impression, and a
                        comparable mereness barely ghosts in the upper dot of the colon which copy O
                        clearly defines. Admittedly, such pains may seem hardly worth the taking if
                        the instances are supposed isolated. But in the first place they are not,
                        and in the second place—if an editor supposes instead that
                        Blake’s pointing does matter in its minutest particular—or
                        even that it <hi rend="i">may</hi> matter-then he must draw very heavily on
                        his reserves of both patience and perspicuity to ferret it out at its best
                        or most likely. VDA, 107, suggests how infinite those reserves may have to
                        be. If one had decided that copy O’s clear colon in 167 gave its dots
                        a necessary priority over vacuity in other impressions—or if he had
                        only copy O to rely on—he would place a dot after the "And"
                        in 107, on the grounds that there is ample evidence that Blake’s
                        pointing does not abide rational questioning. But, fortunately, copies A and
                        B would be near at hand to provide here a void editorially preferable on
                        every logical ground. In the long run, the problems and the contradictory
                        solutions available for them probably exceed even a theoretic comprehension,
                        much more any set of workable editorial principles.</p>
          <p>A significant variant worth noting because it may affect decisions about the
                        relative dates of the <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> copies appears in 1. 4 of
                        "The Lilly" in copy B. Whereas in copies A and T, e.g., the word
                        "bright" at the end of the line is etched in with a left-serifed
                        "g" in correspondence with the other g’s on the
                        impressions, in "B" an unserified "bright" has been
                        written into the text. If this is the only impression containing a variant
                        "g" of this sort, there may be grounds adduced for supposing that
                        it was also the first impression Blake made from the copper. He seems to
                        have rubbed out the foliage encroaching on the line in which he wanted
                        "bright" to appear in an initial attempt to get the space to
                        accommodate it. When he found out he could not do that to his esthetic
                        satisfaction, he put it instead in the position of a catchword below the
                        line. Since in other copies I have seen the marginal foliage is intact on
                        line with "beauty" (nearly touching it in most cases), it would
                        seem that they were made after the initial trial and error of "B"
                        had located the received positioning of "bright" under and to the
                        right of "beauty." On another dating matter, it seems a perverse
                        reading of the evidence to suppose that a "clear postmark date of 28
                        August" 1799 on a Blake to Trusler letter "must" be a mistake
                        because it contradicts the written date of 23 August. If there is other
                        evidence to support this decision, we would seem to need it. Again, the
                        contradiction between an 18 October 1791 letter and the "7" which
                        makes up "the only really clear part of the postmark" might be
                        suggestively resolved by supposing that the writer (Reveley) misdated the
                        letter by one day. While the facts perhaps cannot be "reconciled"
                        definitively, a reader could be aided towards a likely inference if he were
                        told whether the legible "7" might have formed part of a
                        "17." Or he could be kept from that speculation by being told
                        otherwise. Certain other problems of dating—particularly of possible
                        early drafts of early poems—must probably remain forever in the realm
                        of mere speculation, though it is difficult to believe that Blake wrote none
                        of the texts of his illuminated works much earlier than present dating
                            suggests.<ref target="n9" type="note">1</ref><note id="n9"><hi rend="s">1</hi> See my "Thel, <hi rend="i">Thelyphthora</hi>, and the Daughters of Albion" (forthcoming
                            in <hi rend="i">Studies in Romanticism</hi>), wherein I demonstrate the
                            derivation of Blake’s title (θηλ means "female") from
                            a book advocating polygamy which was published in 1780-81.</note></p>
          <p>A few concluding queries. How likely is it that Blake meant to write
                        "o’er-fired" in <hi rend="i">Thel</hi>, 29, when the word
                        has application only to ceramics (according to the OED), would seem to
                        contradict the sense of its context, and may well be of a piece with
                        non-words like "sendinding" (J 88) and "Chastitity" (J
                        94), which B rightly emends in the text? Admittedly, B’s inferable
                        principle in such a retention is in itself unobjectionable, but one may wish
                        that both rational and esthetic considerations had led him to place
                        "o‘erfir’d" in the footnote,
                        "o‘ertired" in the text. "Anglus" may, as B
                        suggests, refer to Robert Hunt (1051), but there is perhaps better
                        contextual evidence in the <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> for supposing that it
                        refers instead to the generic "taught" Englishman who is "so
                        used to Journeymens undecided bungling that [he] cannot bear the firmness of
                        a Masters Touch." Is it possible to establish in a repeatable way the
                        precise measurements of the plates which B provides as a way of deciding
                        which ones appeared back to back on the same copper? I do not at all call
                        into question the brilliant work of this sort which went into B’s
                        classic essay on the masking of <hi rend="i">America</hi>, but do find my
                        own measurements (and Bindman’s) sufficiently at odds with B’s
                        to create some doubt whether millimeter accuracy is attainable on a level of
                        consensus. Is it perhaps more likely that the engimatic letters below the
                        text in MHH 6 are "MOH" (with a possible "H" inferable
                        as well from the blur following) rather than "WOH," as B suggests
                        (79-80)? That rendition would have the relevance of abbreviating the
                        poem’s title. Finally, I note a proof-reading error, 684, where <pb id="p14-161" n="161"/><hi rend="i">Exp.</hi> 50 is accorded the roman letters which belong to
                        51.</p>
          <p>Many readers who ponder these volumes will be variously afflicted with a
                        certain sense of disappointment, tempered, however, with the recollection
                        that, in terms of the editorial purposes and assumptions set forth in his
                        introductory matter, Professor Bentley has fulfilled his promise, if not,
                        altogether, our hopes for a fully serviceable text and textual commentary on
                        Blake’s work. What is certain is that, in a multitude of ways, future
                        editors of reading texts and anthologies are bound to profit from the
                        immense labor which has gone into this edition. And its ultimate review and
                        evaluation will only be made by the next Blake editor who sets himself the
                        prodigious task of thoroughly retracing, in all its minute particulars, the
                        course of many years of devoted application that has led us this far along
                        the road to the establishment and refinement of the Blakean canon. A vast
                        number of these particulars will only come into view and focus because of
                        this edition—a fact that will continue to inspire the positive
                        assessments which it will continue to receive and which it so richly
                        deserves.</p>

                        else, as far as I know), The Large Book of Designs (ibid.), the large color
                        prints, <hi rend="i">Job</hi>, Dante, and a number of incidental prints in
                        none of these collected publications. No book reproducing Blake’s
                        engraved designs is nearly so extensive.</p>
          <p>Further, the standards of production are high. The page size is large, 9
                        3/8" × 13", so that <hi rend="i">America</hi>, <pb id="p14-162" n="162"/><hi rend="i">Europe, Jerusalem</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Job</hi> can be given
                        full size (some of the smaller prints are reproduced as many as eleven to a
                        page), and every print which is larger than this, such as the large color
                        prints, Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, and Dante, is
                        reproduced whole in reduced size and with a true-size detail. The quality of
                        the photographs and reproductions appears to be fine, and many variants are
                        reproduced. For example, there are three versions of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> pl. 1 and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl. 28 and four of
                            <hi rend="i">Job</hi> pl. 16. The plates are arranged straightforwardly
                        in chronological order, with variants gathered after the published version
                        of the work (e.g., <hi rend="i">America</hi>, pls. 1-18, a-c), and the text,
                        as is appropriate for a work aimed at a large audience, is matter of fact
                        and unpretentious. The brief "Introduction: Blake as a graphic
                        artist" (pp. 10-22) has the same merits and attitudes as Mr.
                        Bindman’s comprehensive <hi rend="i">Blake as an artist</hi> (1977),
                        and the succinct "Notes to the Plates" (pp. 465-88) are reliably
                        based upon standard Blake scholarship. This is a work which can be
                        recommended with enthusiasm to lovers and students of Blake.</p>
          <p>The copies reproduced come from widely separated collections, from Cambridge
                        to Canberra, but the great majority of groups of plates, such as those for
                            <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi>, come from the British Museum Print
                        Room and Library (14), with three groups from the Fitzwilliam Museum
                        (Cambridge), two each from the Library of Congress, the Pierpont Morgan
                        Library, and the Huntington Library, and one each from Bodley, The
                        University of Glasgow, and Sir Geoffrey Keynes. The originals seem to have
                        been chosen for the convenience of the editor, who teaches at the University
                        of London and who made an admirable catalogue of the Fitzwilliam Blake
                        collection, rather than for the convenience of the scholar. Naturally
                        black-and-white plates on coated, cream-colored paper cannot indicate the
                        red, sepia, blue, green, and orange in which the originals of the works in
                        Illuminated Printing are printed, much less their subsequent coloring.
                        However, it would have been desirable to choose uncolored originals instead
                        of the watercolored copies of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (B), <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> (B), and <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of
                            Experience</hi> (B), for of course much of Blake’s delicate or
                        glorious coloring comes out simply muddy and distracting when reproduced in
                        black-and-white. Further, little effort seems to have been made to reproduce
                        copies of works in Illuminated Printing which have not appeared in facsimile
                        before. Some of the copies given here have been reproduced three or four
                        times, and only <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (B), <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                        (A), <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (B), and <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (B) appear
                        to be reproduced here for the first time. Such conventionality of choice
                        represents a missed opportunity, for scholars will of course turn to the
                        color facsimiles of the same copies rather than to these black-and-white
                        photographs.</p>
          <p>The generosity of the work is admirable. Far from shunning duplication merely
                        because a design has been reproduced on a previous page, all the <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> are repeated unchanged in the <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, the <hi rend="i">For
                            Children</hi> plates are given again, with mostly minor alterations, in
                            <hi rend="i">For the Sexes</hi>, and all the scenes in the Large and
                        Small Books of Designs are of course reproduced elsewhere here. For the
                        Blake student, here is God’s plenty.</p>
          <p>For the general reader, there are only a few defects of significance. One
                        such defect is the lack of a transcript of Blake’s texts, which are
                        here sometimes faint (<hi rend="i">Visions</hi>) or obscure (<hi rend="i">No
                            Natural Religion, Urizen, Songs</hi>)—but this of course would
                        have required another volume and a different kind of enterprise. (One might
                        as well ask for color reproductions at the same price.) Most of the texts
                        are plainly legible—ironically the clearest text is that for
                        Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>—and all can be read
                        with magnification and patience. More important is the lack of captions or
                        running-heads for the reproductions themselves. The reader opening at random
                        to the design numbered 519 must first determine whether this is a page
                        number (no) or a plate number (yes) and then look it up in the List of
                        Plates (p. 493) to discover that it is for <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl.
                        40. Yet more distracting is the lack of an index, which is inexcusable. If
                        one wants to discover, say, where "Our End is come" is reproduced,
                        one can find it only by trudging all through the List of Plates or the Notes
                        to the Plates; it is given as no. 81, 316, and 402. Plate captions and an
                        index are vital to a compendious work like this, and both editor and
                        publisher should have insisted upon them.</p>
          <p>For the general reader, then, <hi rend="i">The Complete Graphic Works of
                            William Blake</hi> is admirable value. What is there in it for the Blake
                        scholar who has ready access to the scholarship on which the book is based?
                        Well, for one thing, there are photographs of several copies of works in
                        Illuminated Printing which have apparently not been reproduced before. For
                        another, there are several designs which have not previously been reproduced
                        at all. One of these (no. 8), called "Charity" and distantly
                        related to <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl. 46 (no. 525), was acquired by the
                        British Museum Print Room in 1958, and Mr. Bindman is cautiously (and
                        rightly, in my view) "inclined to accept it" as Blake’s (p.
                        467). Another (no. 185), "an experiment in colour-printing" called
                        "An estuary with figures in a boat," is described even more
                        cautiously: "the attribution to Blake cannot be regarded as
                        certain" (p. 473), despite the mysterious inscription on it in an
                        unidentified hand: "By William Blake (Mr Stothard)." It is unlike
                        almost anything else Blake is known to have done, and the inscription is the
                        chief reason for associating it with him. Whether or not we accept the work
                        as Blake’s, the visual (or at least black-and white) evidence is now
                        before us on which to base a decision.</p>
          <p>How complete and comprehensive is the collection of <hi rend="i">Graphic
                            Works</hi> presented here? The first problem comes with the word
                        "Graphic," which often means writing or drawing but here means
                        "contemporary engraved or etched or lithographed design or text"
                        (for some of the plates have no design). Mr. Bindman says, "I have set
                        out to reproduce every printed [i.e., contemporary engraved] design by Blake
                        as well as their major variants" (p. 7). Thus, we have Blake’s
                        engraving of his own designs and other engravers’ copies of
                        Blake’s designs, as in Burger’s <hi rend="i">Leonora</hi>,
                        Malkin’s <hi rend="i">A Father’s Memoir</hi>, and
                        Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>, and Mr. Bindman has generously
                        thrown in one or two of Blake’s engravings after the designs of other
                        men such as that for Bonnycastle’s <hi rend="i">Mensuration</hi>—"there is little to <pb id="p14-163" n="163"/>
                        distinguish it from such work by Heath and others" (p. 467). The book
                        of course omits designs which Blake copied from elsewhere, such as those for
                        the Portland Vase in Darwin’s <hi rend="i">Botanic Garden</hi>, for
                        Gough’s <hi rend="i">Sepulchral Monuments, Vetusta Monumenta</hi>,
                        and Stedman’s <hi rend="i">Narrative</hi>, even though some of them
                        have important Blakean elements. It omits the plates after Blake’s
                        designs in Whitaker’s <hi rend="i">Seraph</hi> (1828) and in
                        Hamilton’s <hi rend="i">English School</hi> (1831), presumably
                        because they were made by other engravers after Blake died in 1827 and
                        because they were already reproduced in their earlier forms. There are,
                        however, a few plates which appear to belong here on Mr. Bindman’s
                        principles but which are missing. Blake’s first and third plates for
                        Gay’s <hi rend="i">Fables</hi> (1793) are significantly his own, for
                        they incorporate characteristic Blakean elements not in the designs he was
                        copying. The very small design of two old men planting trees in
                        Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Essays on Physiognomy</hi> (1788) is probably
                        designed by Blake, though it is signed only "<hi rend="i">Blake
                        So</hi>" (see <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> [1977], pp. 594, 754), and
                        Varley’s <hi rend="i">Zodiacal Physiognomy</hi> (1828) has five
                        designs by Blake copied by Varley and engraved by Linnell, including two of
                        the "Ghost of a Flea"—and two more unpublished engravings
                        after Blake for it are in the collection of Sir Geoffrey Keynes. (Perhaps
                        the Varley plates were excluded because they were not made by Blake for the
                        purpose of being engraved and may be post-humous.) Another
                        "Complete" collection of contemporary printed copies of
                        Blake’s designs might legitimately omit a few of these designs and
                        include a few others.</p>
          <p>Similarly, the variant states of plates are, of course, far from complete.
                        The reproduction of <hi rend="i">America</hi> pl. 4 (no. 149) lacks the last
                        four lines of text, but there is no reproduction of the complete plate. The
                            <hi rend="i">America</hi> copperplate fragment is reproduced along with
                        a print from it (no. 164a), but the copperplate shows a number of details
                        not visible in the print, such as most of the last line of text. The
                        important proof variants of <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> found in <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> are omitted, and there is no reproduction of the
                        important verbal and graphic variants in <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> pl. 1
                        ("FIRST" omitted), pl. 6 (two figures omitted in copy D), pl. 15
                        (two figures added in G), pl. 24 (two figures omitted in D), and pl. 25 (a
                        line omitted in A).</p>
          <p>The attraction of this volume to the scholar is largely the same as for the
                        general reader: It collects in one place a vast number of fine reproductions
                        after contemporary engravings from Blake’s designs and does so
                        remarkably faithfully and inexpensively. With such riches before us, it is
                        ungenerous to complain. This is a work which all students and lovers of
                        Blake will wish to own.</p>

          <p>Jack Lindsay first read Blake in 1917-18 when he was in his teens. His
                        world-view was provided by Blake and by Dostoevsky and Shakespeare. In 1927
                        he published a small but surprisingly informative booklet, <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi>, which saw a second edition in 1929.
                        Lindsay’s essay on Blake’s meter in the Scholaris Press
                        edition of the <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> appeared in the same
                        year. Then, for about forty years, Lindsay published little on Blake (a few
                        reviews and essays), but, as he writes in the foreword to the full-scale
                        biography on Blake which he published in 1978, "through the years I
                        have kept returning to him and seeking to revalue him in terms of the
                        problems thrown up by my own development." And he adds: "I do not
                        write as someone interested in Blake from the outside, but as someone for
                        whom he has been a vitally formative influence throughout life."</p>
          <p>Every reader of Lindsay’s book should have these words in mind. They
                        explain the author’s personal approach to Blake. This emphasis on the
                        applicability of Blake’s ideas to the social, political and
                        economical thinking of a man living in the twentieth century is the most
                        attractive feature of Lindsay’s book. At the same time it makes the
                        book misleading to any reader not already familiar with Blake. Lindsay
                        stresses what is of interest to him: Blake’s political radicalism,
                        his heretical antinomianism, his prophetical revolutionarism, his
                        imaginative humanism, his pre-marxian dialectics and the strong—and
                        by other commentators frequently undervalued—materialistic element in
                        his thought. But Lindsay never takes seriously Blake’s definition of
                        himself as a Christian visionary, and he is out of sympathy with
                        Blake’s gradual development from political radical to spiritualist
                        mystic. Lindsay’s Blake never grows older than forty. Blake’s
                        comments on the spiritual world to Crabb Robinson make "painful
                        reading" to him.</p>
          <p>Lindsay tolerates religious ideas only so far as they can be used as
                        stand-ins for lampoons against the established econo-political system. As a
                        consequence, he gives us a denaturalized Blake. For this reason
                        Lindsay’s book is not a biography in the sense that
                        Gilchrist’s and Mona Wilson’s books are biographies. It is a
                        specialized investigation of one single question: why read Blake today?</p>
          <p>Oddly enough, although Jack Lindsay is son and pupil of the artist Norman
                        Lindsay, he does not seem to be particularly interested in Blake as a
                        pictorial artist. The most notable defects, also, are found in the sections
                        on Blake’s pictorial works. In a way this is understandable. In
                        Blake, Lindsay seeks help to clarify his own view of man as he appears
                        today, formed by history and living under an industrialized capitalist
                        economic system. From this point of view Blake the writer seems more
                        rewarding than Blake the artist. In spite of this I feel that
                        Lindsay’s treatment of Blake’s artistic achievements is more
                        cavalier than it should be. To substantiate this criticism, I shall give
                        examples of dubious or incomplete statements in Lindsay’s book.</p>
          <pb id="p14-165" n="165"/>
          <p>The section on the anonymous drawings made at the opening of the coffin of
                        Edward I in 1774 (p. 2) is incorrect. There are two drawings, and King
                        Edward appears twice in each of them.<ref target="n10" type="note">1</ref>
                        According to Lindsay both drawings are inscribed in a hand resembling that
                        of young Blake, but this is true only of one of them, namely the one showing
                        coffin and corpse strictly from above. The other drawing, made in isometric
                        perspective, differs in style and bears inscriptions in a different
                        hand—I doubt its general inclusion in the oeuvre of Blake. <note id="n10"><hi rend="s">1</hi> See Martin Butlin, <hi rend="i">William

          <p>However that may be, Blake certainly did not get his idea of figures clad in
                        tight-fitting garments from this source, as Lindsay maintains. Such a
                        supposition seems likely only if we confine ourselves to Ayloffe’s
                        account of the opening, but is rendered impossible by the drawings
                        themselves, none of which reveals the form of the limbs or the body under
                        the garment. In three of the sketches even the face is only dimly seen
                        through the veil covering it, or not seen at all; only one of the isometric
                        sketches shows the uncovered face.</p>
          <p>Much has been written about the tight fitting dresses in Blake’s
                        figures. Strictly speaking there are two different kinds of such dresses:
                        body-tights made from fabric, resembling those used by modern dancers, and
                        made visible on the naked body only by their color, a few folds, and by
                        rings around wrists and ankles; and tight-fitting scaly armour. A likely
                        source for the latter has been found by Morton Paley in the English edition
                        of Montfaucon: <q> The military habit of the <hi rend="i">Sarmatians</hi> is
                            the most extraordinary one we have yet seen. For it’s so closely
                            adjusted to their Body from the Neck to the very Sole of the Foot, that
                            all the Motions of the Members and Muscles appear as plainly through it,
                            as if the Body was naked. ‘Tis also covered with Scales without
                            the least Interval, even as low as the Hand, and down to the Sole of the

          <p>Several of the Roman Emperors bore the name of honor Sarmaticus, because they
                        had defeated Sarmatians, notably Trajanus, on whose column at Rome
                        Sarmatians are shown, all clad in tight-fitting scaly armour, covering even
                        the hands but not the feet.<ref target="n13" type="note">4</ref> A rider of

          <p>The textile body-tights have a similar source. Tight-fitting trousers of
                        linen were used by several barbarian tribes in classical times. Blouses of a
                        similar kind were also common. By the time of Trajan they had spread into
                        the Roman army, and Roman <hi rend="i">auxilaria</hi> and legionaries are
                        shown wearing them on the column of Trajanus, and also on the column of
                        Marcus Aurelius. Such dresses are frequent in Raphael’s works in the
                        Vatican <hi rend="i">stanze</hi> and a few examples are found in the
                        cartoons for the Sistina tapestries.<ref target="n15" type="note">6</ref>
                        They were a favorite formula with Giulio Romano and several other
                        mannerists, and they are common in the works of some of Blake’s
                        contemporaries, especially Fuseli. In view of Raphael’s practice of
                        making sketches of the nude bodies for figures who were to appear draped in
                        the finished pictures, the use of tight-fitting clothes was logical: it
                        saved the maximum amount of work in drawing the nudes. <note id="n15"><hi rend="s">6</hi> See the figure of Heliodorus in <hi rend="i">The

                            Arimathea</hi>, Lindsay identifies the direct source (the ultimate
                        source being Michelangelo’s "Joseph of Arimathea" in <hi rend="i">The Crucifixion of Peter</hi>) as an engraving by
                        "Béatrizat" (misprint for Nicolas Beatrizet) although Blake
                        himself stated that he had copied "a drawing by Salviati after Michael
                            Angelo."<ref target="n16" type="note">7</ref> Blake the engraver
                        was likely to know the difference between a drawing and an engraving. If

                        it has not been traced. He seems to have had some doubts about the
                        attribution; in another annotation he calls the work merely "an old

          <p>On p. 12 Lindsay calls into doubt the story about Blake and Moser. But he
                        misses the fact that the issue at stake was not Florentine versus Venetian
                        and Flemish painting, but sixteenth-century Italian engraving versus
                        engravings of the Rubens and Le Brun workshops. Moser evidently disliked the
                        "hard and dry" engravings after Raphael and Michelangelo by
                        Marcantonio Raimondi, Agostino Veneziano, Giorgio Ghisi, etc., not Raphael
                        and Michelangelo themselves, which Moser and Reynolds, of course, valued
                        highly.</p>
          <p>The date 1780 on the engraving <hi rend="i">Albion Rose</hi> should be
                        treated with more caution than Lindsay allows. The only known state is
                        signed and dated "WB inv 1780." Most commentators, including
                        Lindsay, find this date difficult to reconcile with the mature style of
                        engraving and with the lettering and symbolism of the caption in the lower
                        margin. I agree that the state must be dated after 1800, probably 1804. But
                        unlike Lindsay I believe that an earlier state has existed, the date 1780
                        being the almost only survivor from the lost first state. The existence of
                        an earlier state is supported by the color-printed versions. All
                        color-prints by Blake which can be dated were done in or about 1795; the
                        Huntington Library copy of <hi rend="i">Albion Rose</hi> is printed on paper
                        watermarked 1794, which indicates a date for the print about
                        1795—Blake seldom kept large stores of paper, and was in a habit of
                        using paper fresh.<ref target="n18" type="note">9</ref> Several of the
                        color-prints were printed from the same plates as the engravings. It is
                        therefore possible that the color-printed versions of <hi rend="i">Albion
                            Rose</hi> conceal an earlier state of the engraving. A description of
                        the state was published by Essick in 1980, after the appearance of
                        Lindsay’s book. <note id="n18"><hi rend="s">9</hi> As far as I am
                            aware no one has yet made a systematic investigation of watermarks on
                            paper used by Blake, or systematically compared dated watermarks with
                            the accepted dates of Blake’s works on paper. The rule seems to
                            be that whenever Blake needed a considerable amount of paper, he bought
                            it fresh. His 537 watercolors for Young were begun in 1795, and the
                            engravings from them were executed in 1796 and 1797; the only dated
                            watermarks are 1794. The color-prints dated 1795 also have watermarks
                            1794. The first copies of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, completed in
                            1819, have watermarks 1818 and 1819. But notice that many of the Dante
                            watercolors of 1824-27 were done on paper watermarked "WELGAR
                            1796."</note></p>
          <p>I also think that the signature on the known <pb id="p14-166" n="166"/>
                        state, "WB inv", is a later addition. It is engraved in a
                        different way from the date, is not quite on a line with it, and shows no
                        signs of polishing or erasure, while marks of scraping are obvious on the
                        date.</p>
          <p>Then comes the question of Blake’s technique. Lindsay uncritically
                        reproduces several mistakes by other writers, and is not quite up to date
                        with recent research. This question will have to be dealt with more fully in
                        a separate article, to be published later. The following remarks are only
                        meant as a short abstract.</p>
          <p>Lindsay is in error in thinking that Cumberland’s method of printing
                        text from etched plates was a stereotype process (p. 31).
                        Cumberland’s recipe for it in <hi rend="i">A New Review with Literary
                            Curiosities and Literary Intelligence</hi>, 1784, and his letters
                        describing the process to his brother about the same time, make it clear
                        that Cumberland’s plates were done in ordinary etching on a
                        wax-asphaltum-rosin ground, and printed in intaglio.<ref target="n19" type="note">10</ref> Blake’s reference to a method for
                        illuminated printing in <hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon</hi> was almost
                        certainly to Cumberland’s method, not to Blake’s own, contrary
                        to what Lindsay thinks.<ref target="n20" type="note">11</ref><hi rend="i">An Island</hi> was almost certainly written in the winter of
                        1784-85, and Blake himself wrote that he invented the stereotype process in
                            1788.<ref target="n21" type="note">12</ref> Lindsay also neglects
                        Blake’s only surviving stereotype plate, a fragment of a cancelled

                        was step-etched in order to hinder underbiting of the raised lines.<ref target="n22" type="note">13</ref> Since stereotype etching was known

          <p>Lindsay also writes that the reason for Blake’s rejection of oil
                        painting was his inability to handle oil paint, an inability which he
                        rationalized by condemning oil as an inferior medium.<ref target="n25" type="note">16</ref> He also says that Blake’s alternative to oil

          <p>In the eighteenth century most artists found oils difficult to handle. For
                        this reason Reynolds, for instance, introduced a variety of binders into his
                        paintings: egg white, gum, wax, mastic dissolved in spirits of turpentine,
                        copaiba balsam, and meguilp (a mixture of mastic dissolved in boiling oil
                        with lead siccative), often with disastrous results.<ref target="n27" type="note">18</ref> It is common knowledge that paintings of the
                        eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are often in a worse state of
                        preservation than earlier works, due to the heterogenous mixtures used in
                        their composition. For the same reason they are often difficult or
                        impossible to clean and restore.<ref target="n28" type="note">19</ref>
                        Examples abound among the works of even the greatest painters: Chardin,

          <p>The main difficulty in handling oils and achieving a reasonbly permanent
                        result is incurred by the drying of the vegetable oils. This process is slow
                        compared with that of aqueous paint. All the oils used in painting dry
                        because of a chemical reaction with atmospheric oxygen; they
                        "burn" dry, and at the same time they increase in weight up to
                        26%, and also in volume.<ref target="n29" type="note">20</ref> This process
                        is complicated by the metal salts used as pigments. Some of them, containing
                        lead, copper, mangan or cobalt, make the drying faster; others, containing
                        zinc, aluminum, quicksilver or cadmium, slow it down.<ref target="n30" type="note">21</ref> Some combine—to varying degrees—with
                        the fatty acids in the oils, forming soaps, which make the layers
                        increasingly transparent, and cause underlayers to show through.<ref target="n31" type="note">22</ref> Paints containing such pigments must
                        be applied thicker than at first seems necessary. <note id="n29"><hi rend="s">20</hi> The great pioneer works on the drying of oils are

          <p>It therefore becomes very difficult for the artist to calculate the variety
                        of chemical reactions going on in a drying oil painting. Yet, if he intends
                        to achieve any perfection of detail in a work too large to be completed in a
                        single sitting, then he will have to apply several coats of paint, one on
                        top of the other, over a long period of time. It will then be necessary for
                        him to use only rapidly drying pigments in the undercoats (white lead,
                        verdigris, umber, cobalt blue), and reserve the slowly drying pigments for
                        the top layers (zinc white, organic dyes precipitated on alum, vermilion,
                        cadmium yellow). He will also have to calculate the drying times of mixtures
                        of rapid and slow driers, such as white lead and vermilion, or cobalt blue
                        and cadmium yellow. Any neglect of the different drying times of different
                        paints will result in over-long waiting for underlayers to dry, will cause
                        solvent action on insufficiently dried layers, sinking in, soiling,
                        discoloration, and erratic changes of chroma and light values. It will also,
                        for obvious reasons, produce cracking. A coat rapid in drying applied on top
                        of a coat slow in drying will crack, because the latter will go on combining
                        with oxygen long after the former has ceased to do so; it will swell
                        underneath the already hard layer, and crack and dislocate it. The addition
                        of substances meant to equalize drying speed(driers to slow-drying pigments,
                        retarders to fast-drying pigments) is likely to complicate the processes
                        beyond calculation, and cause more problems than it was meant to solve.</p>
          <p>In the middle ages oil painting was known at least from the eleventh century,
                        but for works of high quality aqueous binders were preferred. This was made
                        clear by R. E. Raspe in his <hi rend="i">A Critical Essay on Oil Painting;
                            proving that the Art of Painting in Oil was known before the pretended
                            discovery of John and Hubert van Eyck; to which are added

                        twelfth century, though Raspe dated it earlier, and it contains an account
                        of how to make linseed oil and how to use it for painting.<ref target="n32" type="note">23</ref> Heraclius (early eleventh century) also mentions

                        printed in Augsburg, 1477; it contains several quotations from Theophilus,

                            translation of chapter 25, headed "De coloribus oleo et gvmmi
                            terendis" (p. 24), should be pointed out. Theophilos refers to
                            pigments which can be ground either with linseed oil or gum, not with an
                            emulsion of oil in a solution of gum in water, as Dodwell mistakenly
                            believes, since he translates "gummi" as "this [drying]
                            medium" (the brackets are Dodwell’s) or "medium."
                            It should be "gum." For a discussion of mss. and former

          <p>Blake is likely to have known this book. When he wrote, in his <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>, that he will inquire "in another work

                        colours," he was probably referring to Raspe’s work.<ref target="n33" type="note">24</ref> Blake’s own treatise on

                        that Theophilos did not recommend oils for works of high quality, and
                        complained of the tedious waiting for undercoats to dry.<ref target="n35" type="note">26</ref> The "forger" alluded to by Blake must

                            a ground of glue and chalk similar to that used by Blake, and says that
                            it is found underlying the colors on Egyptian mummy-cases, and is common
                            in medieval painting (pp. 22, 25). The making of a hide glue identical
                            with the carpenter’s glue of more recent times is described by
                            Theophilos in ch. 18, and the laying of a ground of glue and chalk (or,
                            alternatively, of burnt gypsum) in ch. 19. Blake could have got his

          <p>Oil is also known to yellow in drying. A paint rich in oil will yellow more
                        than a lean one. But a lean paint will be too thick to handle. The addition
                        of a thinner such as spirits of turpentine would be expedient, but this, if
                        added to top layers, would greatly increase the dangers of solvent action on
                        newly dried coats, and also of sinking in and darkening. The use of resinous
                        solutions, either as intermediary varnishes between coats, or as additions
                        to the paints used for top layers, would increase viscosity and thus hinder
                        the undercoats from absorbing the medium from the top coat—and this
                        absorption is the cause of most of the troubles mentioned above. However,
                        even if resins are slower in yellowing than the oils, they in the end yellow
                        more, and they also make the film brittle and thus increase the risk of
                        cracking, as well as of yellowing.<ref target="n41" type="note">32</ref><note id="n41"><hi rend="s">32</hi> Alexander Eibner, <hi rend="i">Entwicklung und Werkstoffe der Malerei</hi>, p. 175 and Appendix E.

          <p>For this reason the old masters often chose an aqueous binder for pigments
                        especially likely to be altered by the yellowing of the oil, such as the

          <p>The old masters understood the problems created by oily vehicles and knew how
                        to solve them, but with the rise of Academies, which taught no mean
                        handicrafts, and the simultaneous decline of workshop education for artists,
                        the old rules were soon forgotten, and the oil painters found themselves
                        entangled in difficulties.<ref target="n44" type="note">35</ref> Oil had
                        become a hindrance to free and easy execution and a danger to the
                        preservation of pictures, or, as Blake wrote, "a fetter to genius and a
                        dungeon to art."<ref target="n45" type="note">36</ref><note id="n44"><hi rend="s">35</hi> The rules could be summarized thus: make
                            undercoats strong in binding, rapid in drying, hard and lean. Make top
                            coats weak in binding, slow in drying, soft, fat. The old masters knew
                            which binders and which pigments were suitable for undercoats, which for
                            top coats; which pigments were compatible with which binders, and which
                            pigments could not be mixed with each other. The "secret" of
                            their success was not something that could be kept in a bottle; it was
                            the result of knowledge, training and skill. See Cennini’s
                            introduction to his list of pigments (ch. 35, Milanesi ed., p. 49):
                            "let us come to the grinding of colours, showing you which colours
                            are the finest, and the coarsest, and the worst; which one wants to be
                            ground or worked up little, which one much; which one wants one binder,
                            which one wants another; and just as they differ in their colours, so
                            they do in the natures of their binders, and in grinding." In ch.
                            56 (p. 60) he warns against the mixture of verdigris and white lead, and
                            in ch. 117 (p. 97) he says that the lower layers in gessoing ought to be
                            stronger in binding, "because the gesso grosso [undercoat] is your
                            foundation for everything."</note><note id="n45"><hi rend="s">36</hi> K 566.</note></p>
          <p>The easiest way out of these difficulties would be to paint <hi rend="i">alla
                            prima</hi>, never or seldom having to add any paint on top of a layer
                        already completed. Not surprisingly, this method became more and more
                        dominant during the nineteenth century. In the hands of the impressionists
                        it led to a sketchy manner, but it is possible to paint a large, detailed
                        painting <hi rend="i">alla prima</hi>, completing it piece by piece, as in
                            <hi rend="i">fresco.</hi> This method was used by Caspar David
                        Friedrich, Adolf von Menzel, Wilhelm Leibl, William Holman Hunt and, in his
                        early works, by J. E. Millais.<ref target="n46" type="note">37</ref> Such a
                        mode of painting, of course, makes the calculation of the effect of the
                        whole difficult. Extensive retouching afterwards is often found necessary,
                        and thus the advantages of the method are lost. <note id="n46"><hi rend="s">37</hi> The <hi rend="i">alla prima</hi> technique of the

          <p>Blake’s easy way out was to discard oil altogether, and to use an
                        aqueous paint instead. He seems to have had a good reason to do so. Such
                        paints dry uniformly with the evaporation of water, and the painter may
                        disregard the differences in drying times which cause such problems in oil
                        painting. Aqueous paints do not yellow either.</p>
          <p>To this purpose Blake adopted carpenter’s glue, dissolved in warm
                        water. Admittedly he used the same binder for his color-prints, some of
                        which he marked "fresco."<ref target="n47" type="note">38</ref>
                        But since he seems to have experimented with color-printing only for a short
                        time about 1795,<ref target="n48" type="note">39</ref> it can hardly be
                        described as Blake’s "alternative" to oil painting, as
                        Lindsay calls it. Glue as a painting medium was recommended by
                            Vitruvius,<ref target="n49" type="note">40</ref> and also by Cennino
                            Cennini.<ref target="n50" type="note">41</ref> It was used by Raphael
                        for his cartoons, now at the Victoria and Albert Museum.<ref target="n51" type="note">42</ref> It is a sound technique, but one has to remember
                        that a painting in glue should never be varnished with the varnishes
                        commonly employed for giving a protective top coat to oil paintings.<ref target="n52" type="note">43</ref> Oil or any thin varnish will turn such
                        a picture yellow, as Catherine Blake told Lord Egremont in a letter recently
                        published by Bentley.<ref target="n53" type="note">44</ref> The composition
                        of Blake’s own varnish is not known, but Catherine and Tatham
                        described it as "white" (i.e. colorless), hard and of
                        Blake’s own making.<ref target="n54" type="note">45</ref> Blake could
                        have used either egg white or bee’s wax, though the latter could not
                        properly be called "hard," or a composition of resin and wax
                        viscous enough not to penetrate into the paint. <note id="n47"><hi rend="s">38</hi> The Metropolitan Museum (New York) copy of <hi rend="i">God

          <p>Caution in varnishing is especially important if the distemper or glue
                        painting contains white pigments consisting of whiting, i.e., chalk. Oily or
                        resinous varnishes will be absorbed by the chalk, which makes it transparent
                        and brown, like putty (Blake used that word<ref target="n55" type="note">46</ref>)—and the putty commonly used for fastening window glass
                        is nothing but linseed oil and chalk. Blake knew this; he adopted whiting or
                        chalk, and wrote that oil painting "has compelled the use of that
                        destroyer of color, white lead."<ref target="n56" type="note">47</ref>
                        He was right. White lead was the only white pigment in general use in his
                        day that would not absorb oil, and thus remain white and opaque when mixed
                        with an oily vehicle. <note id="n55"><hi rend="s">46</hi> "It [oil]
                            turns every permanent white to a yellow and brown putty," 566. Note
                            the force of the word "permanent." Blake did not consider
                            white lead a permanent white because, unprotected by an oily vehicle, it
                            is known to blacken.</note><note id="n56"><hi rend="s">47</hi> K 566. Further proof that Blake did not
                            use white lead is given by Tatham: "he has touched the lights with
                            white compound of whiting &amp; glue, of which material he laid the
                            ground of his panel" (<hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, p. 515).
                            Whiting (chalk) is, of course, much more permanent than white lead, if
                            an oil-free and resin-free vehicle is used; but if such a painting is
                            varnished, the whites are instantly killed.</note></p>
          <p>I am sure that the chief cause of the darkening of many of Blake’s
                        paintings in glue is inexpert varnishing after Blake’s time.<ref target="n57" type="note">48</ref> For this reason I do not believe, as
                        Lindsay does (p. 129), that Blake <pb id="p14-168" n="168"/> was influenced
                        by Rembrandt; the Rembrandtesque brown chiaroscuro in some of Blake’s
                        "temperas" was produced, not by Blake himself, but by unskilled
                        varnishers of the mid nineteenth century. <note id="n57"><hi rend="s">48</hi> Consider the large color-prints: those that have been
                            varnished (for instance <hi rend="i">Christ Appearing</hi>, in the Tate)
                            are as brown as the "frescos" of <hi rend="i">Nelson</hi> and
                                <hi rend="i">Pitt</hi>, while the unvarnished ones are in a perfect
                            condition.</note></p>
          <p>Since Blake knew that "the nature of gum was to crack" if applied
                        in thick, opaque layers,<ref target="n58" type="note">49</ref> it is obvious
                        that he used the glue precisely in order to be able to paint thick, and to
                        cover underlayers with more or less opaque top coats. Glue would have given
                        him no advantages in painting traditional, transparent watercolors on paper.
                        For this reason I think that he employed the ordinary gum (either gum arabic
                        or gum tragacanth) for normal watercolor drawings. Gum can be applied cold,
                        which is a great advantage, while the glue-water has to be used warm;
                        otherwise it would gelatinize to an unmanageable jelly. <note id="n58"><hi rend="s">49</hi> According to Tatham, confirmed by J. T. Smith, <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, pp. 517, 472.</note></p>
          <p>According to J. T. Smith Blake knew that top layers in glue painting should
                        be "more dilute" than the ground layers,<ref target="n59" type="note">50</ref> which is true—the reverse would produce
                        cracking and flaking. Blake also said that glue was less sensitive to
                        changes in atmospheric moisture than gum.<ref target="n60" type="note">51</ref> This means that he must have added a hardener to the glue. The
                        addition of alum to glue in order to make it more water-resistant and less
                        hygroscopic was ordinary workshop practice in Blake’s day.<ref target="n61" type="note">52</ref><note id="n59"><hi rend="s">50</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Records</hi>, p. 472.</note><note id="n60"><hi rend="s">51</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Records</hi>, p. 472.</note><note id="n61"><hi rend="s">52</hi> See Ralph Mayer, <hi rend="i">The

          <p>All this shows that Blake’s technique was rational and sound. I only
                        have doubts about his invention of the "Portable Fresco," which he
                        described as "a Wall on Canvas or Wood."<ref target="n62" type="note">53</ref> A thick ground of whiting and glue on canvas is

          <p>Minor suggestions and corrections.</p>
          <p>Lindsay’s book is, on the whole, carefully proof-read. It is odd,
                        however, that personal names are often found in an incorrect form: Scamuzzi
                        for Scamozzi (p. 16), Behman for Behmen (p. 40), Schöngauer for
                        Schongauer (p. 171), Béatrizat for Beatrizet (p. 8), Woolett for
                        Woollett (p. 213, fn.; Lindsay has silently reproduced Blake’s
                        misspelling of the name in the <hi rend="i">Public Address</hi>). Once even
                        the sex of an unfortunate artist is changed, as in Antonina de Messina for
                        Antonello da Messina (p. 171).</p>
          <p>Sometimes Lindsay’s handling of source material is careless. The story
                        of William’s and Catherine’s courtship (p. 481) is quoted from
                        Tatham and Lindsay adds that he must have based his account on what
                        Catherine herself told him. But Tatham’s biographical sketch is
                        written on paper watermarked 183(2?), and the same story appears, partly
                        verbatim, in J. T. Smith, 1828 (Smith quotes "a friend"), and in
                        Cunningham, 1830. There is, of course, a possibility that the friend Smith
                        quoted was indeed Tatham, but this should not be taken for granted.<ref target="n65" type="note">56</ref><note id="n65"><hi rend="s">56</hi> See <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, pp.
                            517, 459, 481.</note></p>
          <p>Lindsay seems to believe (p. 33) that the two states of the engraving <hi rend="i">Job</hi> are two separate platès.</p>
          <p>The reference on p. 34 f. to W. Meredith’s <hi rend="i">Commonplace
                            Book</hi> is unsatisfactory, and the book is not in the bibliography. In
                        general, Lindsay’s notes and bibliography seem to have been written
                        more for the convenience of the author than for that of the reader. The
                        foreshortenings are cumbersome, and misspellings occur, such as N. D. Paley
                        for Morton D. Paley, and Acta Academiae Absensis (lovely!) for Acta
                        Academiae Aboensis.</p>
          <p>Misprints in references to and quotations from Blake’s writings may
                        occasionally cause confusion. On p. 212 Lindsay makes Blake say that his art
                        was that of "Dürer and the engravers." This is rather
                        pointless. What Blake wrote in his <hi rend="i">Public Address</hi> was that
                        his technique of engraving was that of "Alb Durers Histories &amp; the
                        old Engravers,"<ref target="n66" type="note">57</ref> meaning, as the
                        context shows, sixteenth century engraving as opposed to that of the
                        eighteenth century print industry. <note id="n66"><hi rend="s">57</hi><hi rend="i"> Notebook</hi>, p. 51 (K 592).</note></p>
          <p>It is not clear why Lindsay, on p. 225, calls <hi rend="i">The Everlasting
                            Gospel</hi> "The Everlasting Mercy," but many of his remarks
                        earlier on the contents of the poem are just and sound. Yet he goes too far
                        when he says that the poem "shows no concern for the texts of the New
                        Testament." Actually it consists mainly of allusions to it and
                        quotations from it. Admittedly Blake’s interpretation of
                        Christ’s teaching differs from that of most Christian conqregations,
                        but that does not necessarily mean that they are without foundation in the
                        Bible. It should be observed, also, that the most outrageous interpretation
                        of Christ’s teaching and character is put into the mouth of
                        Caiphas.</p>
          <p>The quotation on p. 49 f., "Each man . . . ," is given in an
                        incorrect form, and on p. 194 "then" is substituted for
                        "thus" in a quote from the <hi rend="i">Notebook.</hi> And why,
                        indeed, does Lindsay identify Blake’s Jesus in the 1790s with
                        Theotormon? In the <hi rend="i">Song of Los</hi> Blake wrote: "And
                        Jesus . . . recievd A Gospel from wretched Theotormon."<ref target="n67" type="note">58</ref> The two characters are clearly
                        separate here. <note id="n67"><hi rend="s">58</hi> K 246.</note></p>
          <p>On p. 131 Lindsay quotes the annotation "Blake Dim’d with
                        Superstition" on Blake’s letter to Trusler of 23 August 1799 as
                        if it were by Trusler, although it is, according to Keynes, in George
                        Cumberland’s hand.<ref target="n68" type="note">59</ref><note id="n68"><hi rend="s">59</hi> Keynes, <hi rend="i">Blake Studies</hi>,
                            p. 252.</note></p>
          <p>On p. 213 Lindsay quotes Blake’s remark "Models are difficult -
                        enslave one." He misunderstands imaginative art when he criticizes
                        Blake for never asking "if the conception should not be strong enough
                        to stand up against nature." This is exactly what Blake demanded of
                        art, and the reason why he rejected working from models. If a work of art is
                        copied from nature, and thus is dependent on it, how can it stand up against
                        it? If someone really wants to be imaginative, he certainly has to sacrifice
                        some of the charms of nature.</p>
          <p>On p. 141 Lindsay uncritically reproduces an error of editing on the part of
                        Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, p. 83, when he quotes the
                        quatrains by Hayley, in which the author invokes his dead son to inspirit
                        Blake and steady "a Failing Brother’s Hand &amp; Eyes or temper
                        his eccentric Soul." As Bentley carefully points out, the manuscript
                        clearly has "Foiling." According to the OED this word means <pb id="p14-169" n="169"/> "Baffling, disappointing." In my view
                        "foiling" makes excellent sense in this context, and I can see no
                        need for the substitution "failing."</p>
          <p>Is Blake’s accusation that Hayley despised his designs
                        "completely untrue" as Lindsay writes on p. 156? Already the
                        quatrains quoted above show that Hayley did not find Blake’s hand and
                        eye quite to his taste, or his eccentricity tempered enough. It is quite
                        clear that he tried to instruct Blake and correct his engraving, and he
                        asked him to alter the expression of the mouth in the engraving after
                        Flaxman’s medallion of Thomas Hayley, to give the impression of
                        "gay juvenility."<ref target="n69" type="note">60</ref> Blake
                        obeyed, and produced an awkward dawb at the corner of the mouth. Hayley did
                        not defend Blake against those who criticized him; instead he tried to
                        excuse him, as his letters to Lady Hesketh show.<ref target="n70" type="note">61</ref> The main cause of tension between Blake and many of
                        his friends, including Hayley, was that they tried to curb his imagination,
                        for which they had no use, and make him a portrait painter, a reproductive
                        engraver, and an illustrator of literary works (such as Hayley’s),
                        which Blake knew were inferior to his own poems. No wonder that Blake got
                        annoyed, and could not be as grateful as he tried to be, or as his friends
                        thought he ought to be. <note id="n69"><hi rend="s">60</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Records</hi>, pp. 65 f., 69-71, repr. pl. 11.</note><note id="n70"><hi rend="s">61</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Records</hi>, pp. 105 f., 162, 163 f.</note></p>
          <p>I do not believe, either, that Scolfield’s accusation against Blake
                        "bears every mark of truth" (p. 160). Indeed Blake would have been
                        likely to damn the king and call his soldiers slaves but in this case there
                        were too many witnesses who, despite threats by Scolfield and his companion,
                        testified that they had heard no seditious words spoken—and
                        Scolfield’s only witness was proved not to have been present at all,
                        but asleep in a stable, and only to have come out after the witnesses had
                        gathered at the stable door.</p>
          <p>Blake’s later accusation against Hayley for having "hired"
                        Scolfield to "bereave" Blake’s life,<ref target="n71" type="note">62</ref> was, of course, groundless and inexcusable, as
                        shown by Hayley’s exemplary conduct at the time of trial. <note id="n71"><hi rend="s">62</hi> K 544.</note></p>
          <p>Such suspicions can be explained only by the paranoid sense of persecution
                        which Blake developed around 1806-1809; I agree with Lindsay so far that I
                        believe Blake was not in his right mind from about 1806 to about 1818,
                        during which time he quarrelled with most of his friends and lived in
                        isolation for long periods of time.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the "Long Poem" describing Blake’s "Spiritual
                        Acts of [his] three Years’ Slumber on the banks of the Ocean"
                        comprising "an immense number of Verses on One Grand Theme" and
                        written "from immediate Dictation" (letter to Butts 25 April 1803)
                        is certainly the lost manuscript of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> It
                        consisted of twenty-four books, but one cannot be sure if these books were
                        as long as the four eventually printed. Note that chapter 1 originally ended
                        at pl. 14. <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, as we know it today, could well be a
                        compact version, edited on the basis of the entire manuscript, which must
                        have been completed at Felpham, since the engraving of it was begun at South
                        Molton Street in 1804. In the preface to the printed version Blake refers to
                        his "three years slumber on the banks of the Ocean," and says that
                        "this Verse" was "dictated" to him. And the poem begins:
                        "Of the Sleep of Ulro! and of the passage through / Eternal Death! and
                        of the waking to Eternal Life. / This theme calls me in sleep night after
                        night, &amp; evry morn / Awakes me at sun-rise." All this is in
                        agreement with what Blake told Butts in his letter; therefore the two works
                        are the same. The letter cannot refer to the <hi rend="i">The Four
                        Zoas</hi>, dated on the title-page 1797, although this manuscript was
                        revised and added to later, probably at Felpham.</p>
          <p>However, <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> should not be excluded from consideration
                        on account of its shortness. The printed two books, comprising about 1600
                        lines, are only a fragment of the twelve books planned, as shown by the
                        title, where "12" has been changed to "2." The
                        manuscript could have had as many as 9600 lines. It is indeed possible that
                            <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> are editions of
                        portions of one single manuscript, as long as the <hi rend="i">Iliad</hi> or
                        the <hi rend="i">Odyssey.</hi> According to Henry Crabb Robinson, Blake had
                        "six or seven mss. as long as Homer" and "20 tragedies as
                        long as Macbeth." Here the problem is in distinguishing existing
                        manuscripts at least one of which was seen by Crabb Robinson, from other
                        works only produced in the spiritual world.<ref target="n72" type="note">63</ref> Merely because Blake sometimes composed verses which he did
                        not bother to write down, one should not suppose—as Lindsay
                        does—that none of Blake’s lost works were ever written down on
                        paper. There must at least have been manuscripts for the printed works, but
                        not one of them has survived. <note id="n72"><hi rend="s">63</hi> Robinson
                            wrote to Dorothy Wordsworth 16 Feb. 1826 that Blake’s "MSS.
                            are immense in quantity" (<hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, p. 324).
                            He must have seen at least one of them 18 Feb. 1826 when he wrote in his

                            Blake "has left volumes of verse, amounting, it is said, to nearly
                            an hundred, prepared for the press" (<hi rend="i">Blake
                                Records</hi>, p. 506).</note></p>
          <p>Since we know that Tatham burned several of Blake’s manuscripts, it is
                        reasonable to suppose that he was responsible for the destruction of most,
                        if not all, of the lost works.<ref target="n73" type="note">64</ref> We also
                        have every reason to believe that the lost six books of <hi rend="i">The
                            French Revolution</hi> were actually written by 1791, as Blake himself
                        explicitly stated.<ref target="n74" type="note">65</ref> When Lindsay thinks
                        that Blake’s lost works never existed in writing, he seems to have
                        been misled by his own thesis that Blake "published" his works
                        mainly for the spirits. On p. 235 he adds that Blake needed to believe in
                        angels and devils "as a projection of the missing audience which he
                        feels to be potentially present." This is a possible explanation,
                        especially in view of some of Blake’s remarks to Crabb Robinson, but
                        I wonder if an entirely different explanation is not even more probable:
                        because Blake believed in angels and devils, his lack of a fit audience was
                        less severely felt. Thus, what Lindsay thinks is the cause, in my opinion is
                        the effect. <note id="n73"><hi rend="s">64</hi> See Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, pp. 479-84, and <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>,

                            Johnson had no reason to lie (K 134).</note></p>
          <p>On the whole, Lindsay is not in sympathy with the "spiritual" side
                        of Blake. It is true that most educated people today do not believe in
                        spirits, and consequently Blake’s belief in spirits means little to
                        us. If we otherwise sympathize with Blake, as Lindsay does, we are inclined
                        to hope that the spirits did not mean very much to Blake either. But I am
                        quite sure that they did. Blake believed in the existence of angels and
                        devils; they were as real to him as Leonid Bresnev or Jane Fonda are real to
                        us. I do not think it is possible to understand Blake unless this fact is
                        recognized.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding Lindsay’s lack of interest in the spirits, his section
                        on Blake’s visions is sound <pb id="p14-170" n="170"/> (pp. 228 ff.).
                        He also describes a personal experience from 1931, when he, after a
                        fortnight of fasting, "saw the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet," and he
                        quotes Jaensch’s definition of eidetic phenomena from Morton D.
                        Paley’s <hi rend="i">Energy and the Imagination.</hi></p>
          <p>Lindsay quotes Keynes’ suggestion that the vision of <hi rend="i">The
                            Ghost of the Flea</hi> (1819) was based on an engraving of a flea in
                        Hooke’s <hi rend="i">Micrographia.</hi><ref target="n75" type="note">66</ref> I cannot see much resemblance. However, if one examines the
                        background monsters in Blake’s illustrations of 1797-98 of
                        Gray’s <hi rend="i">Poems</hi>, no. 18 for the <hi rend="i">Ode on a
                            Distant Prospect of Eton College</hi>,<ref target="n76" type="note">67</ref> one is immediately struck by the resemblance of one of them to
                        the <hi rend="i">Ghost of a Flea.</hi> Thus, in 1819, Blake saw a vision of
                        his own illustration of one of the "murderous band" that stand in
                        ambush around the playing children "to seize their prey"; one of
                        the "monsters of human fate / And black Misfortune’s baleful
                        train." This agrees very well with Jaensch’s definition of one
                        of the main types of eidetic vision, namely that which consists of
                        "modified after-images." <note id="n75"><hi rend="s">66</hi> Repr.

          <p>Titles, dates and descriptions of Blake’s pictorial works are
                        sometimes wrong. The date of the color-print <hi rend="i">Elohim Creating
                            Adam</hi> should be 1795 (p. 80). Lindsay is wrong when he says (p. 100)
                        that the color-print <hi rend="i">God Judging Adam</hi> is lost; there are
                        copies at the Tate, at the Metropolitan Museum in New York and at the
                        Philadelphia Museum of Art.<ref target="n77" type="note">68</ref> As Butlin
                        has shown, the Tate Gallery copy bears the inscription "God Judging
                        Adam" (under the mount).<ref target="n78" type="note">69</ref> This
                        work was mistakenly given the title "Elijah in the Fiery Chariot"
                        by W. M. Rossetti in 1863, yet Lindsay still thinks that a work with that
                        title exists. To add to the confusion Lindsay has invented one more subject
                        which never existed, called by him "Adam Cast Out by God." These
                        two ghosts should be immediately cast out of Blake’s oeuvre. <note id="n77"><hi rend="s">68</hi> Butlin, <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi>,

          <p>Why does Lindsay say (p. 68) that the old blind and lame man in Jerusalem pl.
                        84 is led to an open door? He is led into a square with two churches in the
                        background, one resembling Westminster Abbey, the doors of which are shut,
                        the other resembling St. Paul’s, the doors of which are not shown.
                        Moreover, I cannot see any "inkhorn at his side."</p>
          <p>Dates and imprints on engravings should be treated with caution. Especially
                        in commercial engraving it was often found convenient to use a date
                        different from that of actual publication, if, for instance, publication was
                        delayed beyond the date planned when the engravings were executed. Thus they
                        cannot be used to estimate how fast an engraver was in completing his
                        plates, especially since engravers were in the habit of putting the same
                        date on different engravings meant for the same publication, even if the
                        engravings were finished at different times. Yet Lindsay does this on p.
                        227.</p>
          <p>Incidentally, the same caution applies to dates in watermarks. The dates on
                        Whatman papers generally agree with the date when the sheets were formed on
                        the molds, but other papermakers sometimes used old molds with watermark
                        dates, without bothering to change the date.<ref target="n80" type="note">71</ref><note id="n80"><hi rend="s">71</hi> Dard Hunter, <hi rend="i">Papermaking

          <p>Erdman’s opinion about the "irony" in <hi rend="i">Nelson</hi> and <hi rend="i">Pitt</hi> is quoted on p. 204, the
                        argument being that these paintings, far from being apotheoses of Pitt and
                        Nelson, are really concealed lampoons against them. Lindsay says that Blake,
                        if Erdman is right, managed to conceal his real feelings completely, and
                        suspects that Blake, anxious for state support, deliberately posed as a
                        patriotic propagandist for the war against France. If he is right in
                        this—and I agree that Lindsay’s view is more reasonable than
                        Erdman’s—then these paintings were meant to be what Blake
                        himself called them, grand apotheoses of the real heroes of the nation. It
                        is clear from the vehement attack in <hi rend="i">The Examiner</hi> that
                        comtemporaries thought that Blake supported the war policy. If this is so,
                        Erdman’s interpretation is wrong. In these works Blake meant to
                        celebrate the heroes of the British nation. The only relevant question that
                        remains is whether Blake was honest or not in painting these apotheoses. Had
                        his opinions about France changed, or was he merely trying to make himself
                        acceptable to those in power? I am glad to see that Lindsay asks this
                        straightforward question, but I am not sure that I agree with his answer
                        that Blake deliberately lied in the hope of getting a government
                        commission.</p>
          <p>It has to be observed that England, which in the 1790s had been an accomplice
                        in the crusade against the French republic, now waged a war on the
                        Napoleonic empire. After 1804 Napoleon fitted Blake’s description of
                        "a Tyrant crownd," and at least after that date—or perhaps
                        already from 1799 when Napoleon abolished the democratic institutions in
                        France and declared himself First Consul—Pitt and Nelson could be
                        seen in a new light, as angels pleased to perform the divine command to
                        crush that tyrant. Blake’s exalted hopes in the peace negotiations of
                            1801-1802<ref target="n81" type="note">72</ref> had already come to
                        nought in 1803, when the French conquered the formerly British Hannover. In
                        1804 Napoleon caused the Spanish declaration of war on Britain. The war of
                        1805 was clearly provoked by the French, who in 1803 had already planned an
                        invasion of England. The only witness who, in 1803, had heard William and
                        Catherine Blake volunteer to cut throats with Napoleon, was the proven liar
                        John Scolfield. <note id="n81"><hi rend="s">72</hi> Letter to Flaxman, 19

          <p>In a letter to Hayley 28 May 1804 Blake criticized the French for idolizing
                        Bonaparte, and in 1815 Cumberland wrote that "Blake says he is fearful
                        they will make too great a Man of Napoleon and enable him to come to this
                            country."<ref target="n82" type="note">73</ref> That Blake
                        condemned the British attack on Copenhagen in 1807<ref target="n83" type="note">74</ref> does not mean that he thought the war against
                        Napoleon unjustified. He could well have disliked the government’s
                        organized graft in selling army commissions, and yet deemed resistance to
                        the French imperialism necessary. If we today condemn the British
                        colonization of India, or the allied bombardment of Dresden in the second
                        world war, it does not mean that we think that Britain and France should
                        never have resisted Hitler. <note id="n82"><hi rend="s">73</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Records</hi>, p. 236.</note><note id="n83"><hi rend="s">74</hi> See David V. Erdman, <hi rend="i">Blake

          <p>I can understand that many commentators find it hard to agree that the author
                        of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> could ever have found the British war against
                        Napoleon justified. Notice the song of the Spectre Sons of Albion in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl. 65: "We were carried away in thousands
                        from London . . . compell’d to fight under the iron whips / Of our
                        captains, fearing our officers more than the enemy" (K 700). But is not
                        the point here that war is the natural result of industrialization and the
                        alienation and oppression of the workers, "that they may grind / And
                        polish brass &amp; iron hour after hour, laborious task, / Kept ignorant of
                        its use: that they may spend the days of wisdom / In sorrowful drudgery to
                        obtain a scanty pittance of bread, / In ignorance to view a small portion
                        and think that All"? And is not all this the result of natural
                        philosophy advocated by Bacon, Newton and Locke, and also by Voltaire and
                        Rousseau, the inspirers of British capitalism and of the bourgeois
                        revolution in France and its child Napoleon? Certainly capitalism is a
                        universal state, in the world and in the soul.</p>
          <p>Perhaps even Erdman would agree with me so far, that the war is the evil
                        means to overthrow war, and that Nelson and Pitt in this apocalyptic sense
                        perform the divine command. Yet I feel there is more to it; Pitt and Nelson
                        are not the senseless tools of a superior will; they are, as Blake says,
                            "<hi rend="i">pleased</hi> to perform the Almighty’s
                        orders" (italics mine). They seem to know exactly what they are
                        doing.</p>
          <p>On p. 246 Jack Lindsay uncritically reproduces H. H. Gilchrist’s
                        technically improbable account (pub. 1887, based on a recent interview with
                        George Richmond), of how James Deville took a plaster cast of Blake’s
                            head.<ref target="n84" type="note">75</ref> According to Richmond, this
                        was the first cast Deville made, and Blake’s mouth is said to have
                        been given an uncharacteristic look of severity because he suffered much
                        pain through the plaster pulling out a quantity of his hair. This pulling
                        out, however, could only have occurred when the mold was being removed from
                        Blake’s face, after the plaster had hardened. No expression of pain
                        at that stage could have left any impression on the plaster. The making of
                        the mold was described somewhat differently by Herbert P. Horne, also in
                        1887 and also after a conversation with Richmond: "Much of the forced
                        expression of the nostrils and more particularly of the mouth is due to the
                        discomforture which the taking of the cast involved, many of Blake’s
                        hairs adhering to the plaster until quite recently."<ref target="n85" type="note">76</ref> There is a hint here that Richmond made two
                        separate statements which were innocently joined together by the
                        interviewers, and particularly by H. H. Gilchrist. Richmond, being a
                        painter, was certainly familiar with the technique of making casts from
                        nature, so I think that he must have told his interviewers something like
                        the following: that Blake’s mouth was distorted, because he found it
                        unpleasant to have his face covered with wet plaster, which, when it begins
                        to harden, gets very warm; that his nostrils were abnormally dilated,
                        because he had to breathe through tubes inserted into them, otherwise he
                        would have died from suffocation under the wet plaster; that these two
                        circumstances accounted for the look of severity; that a number of
                        Blake’s hairs stuck to the mold when it was removed from his face,
                        after having hardened; and that some of the hairs which had stuck to the
                        mold afterwards became attached to the cast, when the cast was made from the
                        mold. <note id="n84"><hi rend="s">75</hi> H. H. Gilchrist, ed., <hi rend="i">Anne Gilchrist</hi> (London, 1887), pp. 258-60; <hi rend="i">Blake
                                Records</hi>, pp. 278 f. and n. 3. Cennino Cennini gives an account
                            of how to take a cast of the face of a living person (Tambroni ed. 1821,
                            chs. 164-66; Milanesi ed. 1859, chs. 182-84). This is for taking the
                            face only, not the whole head, but in the following two chapters a
                            method is described for taking a cast of the whole body, or any part of
                            it, using a divided mold. It is tempting to believe that Deville used
                            this text as a reference in 1823.</note><note id="n85"><hi rend="s">76</hi> Herbert P. Horne, <hi rend="i">Century
                                Guild Hobby Horse</hi> (1887), p. 27, quoted from David Bindman, <hi rend="i">William Blake An Illustrated Catalogue of Works in the
                                Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge</hi> (1970), no. 55.</note></p>
          <p>When Richmond said that this was the first cast Deville took he was almost
                        certainly mistaken. The National Portrait Gallery cast is inscribed:
                        "A. 66 / PUBd AUG. 1, 1823. I DEVILL [sic!] / 17 Strand, London."
                        If the mold was also made about this date, it could hardly have been
                        Deville’s first work, since he, according to J. T. Smith, "when
                        a young man was employed by Mr Nollekens to make casts from
                            moulds."<ref target="n86" type="note">77</ref> Deville was born in
                        1776; would the devoted phrenologist really have delayed the making of his
                        first mold until he was about 47, although he was familiar with the taking
                        of casts from molds since his youth? It is indeed possible that the mold was
                        made much earlier than the National Portrait Gallery cast; Richmond, who
                        owned the undated cast now at the Fitzwilliam, said that Blake was about 50
                        when the mold was made. That would suggest a date around 1807, when Deville
                        was 31. <note id="n86"><hi rend="s">77</hi> John Thomas Smith, <hi rend="i">Nollekens and His Times</hi> (1828), p. 371.</note></p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the "A. 66" on the National Portrait Gallery cast
                        must reasonably refer to Blake’s age when the mold was made. It is
                        true that he was 65, not 66, in August 1823, but the error could be
                        explained by assuming that Deville knew the year but not the day of his
                        birth.</p>
          <p>At present the evidence is hopelessly contradictory. Personally, I would
                        rather trust Deville’s inscription than the Richmond interviews.
                        Richmond met Blake in the spring of 1825, when he was 16; in 1807 he was not
                        born, and in 1823 he did not yet know Blake.</p>
          <p>On p. 268 Lindsay throws doubt on Richmond’s "edifying tale"
                        of Blake’s death because he "in a letter three days later says
                        nothing of having been in at the death." In his letter 15 August 1827
                        to Samuel Palmer, Richmond wrote: "Just before he died His Countenance
                        became fair—His eyes brighten’d and He burst out in Singing of
                        the things he Saw in Heaven[.] In truth He Died like a Saint as a person who
                        was standing by Him Observed."<ref target="n87" type="note">78</ref>
                        This is an eyewitness account. That Richmond did not expressly say "I
                        was there at the death" is only natural, because at that time no one
                        suspected that he was not. Later H. H. Gilchrist, quoting Richmond himself,
                        wrote that "George Richmond . . . closed the poet’s eyes and
                        kissed William Blake in death."<ref target="n88" type="note">79</ref><note id="n87"><hi rend="s">78</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Records</hi>, pp. 346-47.</note><note id="n88"><hi rend="s">79</hi> H. H. Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Anne
                                Gilchrist</hi>, p. 258. The interview must have been after 1882 when
                            Linnell died, Samuel Palmer having died in 1881, since Gilchrist says
                            that Richmond at that time was the only living man who had seen William
                            Blake.</note></p>
          <p>Jack Lindsay is often careless in the handling of sources, and sometimes
                        seems to twist the evidence deliberately in order to discredit
                        "edifying tales spread about by the Ancients," and make Blake less
                        offensively "Christian." I think it is because Lindsay is
                        basically in sympathy with Blake that he tries to play down his
                        "spiritual side"—would he not have been an even grander
                        fellow, had he been an atheist? There is still every reason for Blake to
                        implore God to protect him from his friends.</p>

          <p>Nelson Hilton reports that the proposal for the "Conference on Blake and
                        Criticism" has been filed with the National Endowment for the
                        Humanities, and its decision is expected by 1 March. Should funding be
                        approved, the conference is scheduled for 12-14 November 1981, at the
                        University of California, Santa Cruz. The conference would offer sessions on
                        (1) Blake and the Critical Tradition, (2) Blake and New Literary History,
                        (3) Blake, Feminism, Psychoanalysis. (4) Blake, Textuality, and
                        Deconstruction, and (5) Blake, his Audience, and the Future of the
                        Humanities. Along with the outstanding selection of scholars who have
                        already agreed to participate, the conference would seek additional papers
                        for each session, but particularly for (3) and (5). Some financial
                        assistance should be available to national and/or foreign participants who
                        would otherwise be unable to attend. Anyone interested is invited to contact
                        him (Dept. of English, UGA, Athens, Ga. 30602).</p>
