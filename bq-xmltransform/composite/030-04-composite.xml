          <p>The year started propitiously for the Blake market with the early January sale of two
            drawings, <hi rend="i">An Encounter in Heaven</hi> and a sheet of two recto/verso
            preliminary designs for Commins’s <hi rend="i">Elegy.</hi> These works, all previously
            reproduced in this journal and thus not repeated here, were exchanged from one private
            owner to another through the New York dealer Salander-O’Reilly Galleries. The market
            then went flat. Very flat. The usual run of books with Blake’s copy engravings turned up
            in dealers’ catalogues at their normal rate, but nothing appeared through the spring and
            summer to excite more ambitious collectors. The fall brought forth a richer harvest. On
            14 November, Sotheby’s in London offered, in a single lot, Blake’s 28 water colors from
            the Frick Collection illustrating John Bunyan’s <hi rend="i">Pilgrim’s Progress</hi>
            (Butlin #829.1-19, 21-29)—see illus. 1-4. The lot also included a late water color
            illustration of the first temptation from Milton’s <hi rend="i">Paradise Regained</hi>
            (Butlin #546)—see illus. 5. Thus, the entire Frick holdings of Blake were placed on the
            market as a collection with a published estimate of £260,000-340,000. As far as I can
            determine, this was the largest deaccession of works by Blake from any institutional
            collection. My own pre-sale prediction (I keep trying to be a Blakean prophet, in spite
            of a poor track record) was decidedly negative: the lot would surely be bought-in (i.e.,
            not sold). My reasons were several. Sotheby’s had been trying, on behalf of the Frick,
            to sell the water colors privately for about two years (promises of confidentiality
            prevented me from reporting this in earlier sales reviews). Every potential Blake
            collector was contacted. All said no. The major reason for the negative response was, I
            believe, the low quality of the work. Just compare Blake’s Milton or Job designs with
            the Bunyan series from a connoisseur’s perspective; the results are depressing. I
            suspect that Blake was feeling the effects of his fatal illness when he was sketching
            the Bunyan illustrations c. 1824-27. A shaky hand, awkward figures, poorly-balanced
            compositions. In spite of these problems, one Blake collector with the means to make an
            impact on the market was enthusiastic at first glance. He was then shown Butlin’s entry
            on the series; passion turned to disappointment in a matter of seconds. As Butlin points
            out, there are very good reasons to think that much of the coloring was supplied by Mrs.
            Blake, perhaps after her husband’s death. These sorts of issues seem to have no effect
            on literary scholars writing about the meaning of the designs—witness Gerda Norvig’s
            lengthy <hi rend="i">Dark Figures in the Desired Country: Blake’s Illustrations to</hi>
            The Pilgrim’s Progress (Berkeley: U of California P, 1993). But matters of aesthetic
            quality, particularly in comparison to other works by the same artist, and questions of
            attribution can be killers in the marketplace. Further, one of the time-honored rules of
            auctioneering is to avoid offering at auction anything that has been recently and
            aggressively flogged to most potential bidders. For once, my predictions proved
            prescient: the bidding failed to reach the “reserve”—that is, the price below which the
            auctioneer will not sell the lot (a price that may be lower, but by custom should not be
            higher, than the low estimate of £260,000). However, immediately after the auction two
            collectors—one English, one American—expressed considerable interest in the Bunyan
            designs at a price somewhat less than the low estimate. A brief post-auction bidding
            skirmish ensued. The anonymous English collector won.</p>
          <p>There are, of course, a few other matters to report, mostly under the category of
            Blake’s paintings and drawings. Indeed, I have nothing at all to list under the
            illuminated books. I have as well several retrospective listings, including a colored
            copy of Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> and a major water color by Blake. My
            apologies for being so tardy in reporting the whereabouts of these works.</p>
          <p>The year of all sales and catalogues in the following lists is 1996 unless indicated
            otherwise. The auction houses add their purchaser’s surcharge to the hammer price in
            their price lists. These net amounts are given here, following the official price lists.
            The value added tax levied against the buyer’s surcharge in England is not included.
            Late 1996 sales will be covered in the 1997 review. I am grateful for help in compiling
            this review to E. B. Bentley, G. E. Bentley, Jr., David Bindman, Roger Cucksey (Newport
            Museum and Art Gallery), Detlef Dörrbecker (who supplied me with his own list of 1996
            Blake sales, from which I have stolen shamelessly), Morris Eaves, Sandra Ericson
            (Muhlenberg College), Jenijoy La Belle, Thomas V. Lange, Nick Lott, Kimberly Orlijan,
            Giles Peppiatt of Bonhams, Lawrence Salander, William L. Schneider, Grant F. Scott,
            Miriam Stewart (Harvard University Art Museums), and John Windle. Once again, Patricia
            Neill’s editorial assistance and John Sullivan’s electronic imaging have been
            invaluable.</p>

                  <figDesc>Pencil, 5 × 4 cm. on sheet 8.5 × 6 cm. Collection of David Bindman, who
                    first suggested that this work may be by Blake. Bindman discovered this drawing
                    in an album once in the possession of the family of the engraver Wilson Lowry
                    (1762-1824) containing many drawings by the Lowry family and by John Varley.
                    This context suggests that the drawing may be connected with Abraham Rees, <hi rend="i">The Cyclopœdia</hi> (1820), a publication for which Blake engraved 7
                    plates and Lowry a great many. The image in Rees closest to this drawing is to
                    my eye the “Mask of the Hercules furens of Euripides from a Marble in the Palace
                    Albani in Rome” illustrated on plate 2 of “Ancient Musical Instruments &amp;
                    Masks.” There are a number of differences, including the Assyrian or Babylonian,
                    rather than Grecian, style of the drawn head or mask. The plate is unsigned; but
                    the precedent for Blake having sketched an image for an unsigned plate in Rees
                    has been established by Butlin #678, a sheet bearing pencil studies of a sphinx
                    and Jupiter engraved on “Basso Relievo” plate 1. Bindman, in correspondence, has
                    questioned this connection and suggests that the drawing may represent medieval
                    armor. Blake engraved a plate for Rees titled “Armour Plate IV &amp; V,” but
                    nothing in it or any of the other armor illustrations corresponds to the
                    drawing. Nonetheless, both Bindman and I believe that this very small drawing is
                    probably by Blake.</figDesc>

                    Bowmore acquired the work in 1975. For the subject, see Acts 24:24-27. Paul,
                    having been arrested for “sedition” (Acts 24:5) and still “bound” with chains,
                    preaches about his “faith in Christ” before Antonius Felix, the Roman procurator
                    of Judaea, and his wife Drusilla. The gestures Blake gives to the couple would
                    seem to have been prompted by “Felix trembled” (Acts 24:25). Could Blake’s own
                    scrape with the law concerning seditious expressions have led him to this
                    subject? If so, then the water color would have to be dated to August 1803 or
                    later. Photo courtesy of the Art Gallery of South Australia.</figDesc>

                  by Alexander Anderson after Blake’s design of the weather-house.</head>
                <figDesc>Published in William Hayley, <hi rend="i">The Life and Posthumous Writings
                    of William Cowper</hi> (New York: T. and J. Swords, 1803) 2: 245. Essick
                  collection. “Anderson F[ecit].” is cut in white line in the edge of the thatch
                  above the tree trunk on the left. Anderson (1775-1870) has been considered by some
                  authorities as the father of American wood engraving. The text above the design,
                  the last line below the design, and the 5 lines of verse in the panel on the steps
                  of the weather-house are printed in letterpress; all other letters are part of the
                  wood engraving. In the 1803-04 London ed., with 5 plates engraved by Blake, this
                  design is signed “Blake d &amp; sc” lower left beneath the base of the
                  weather-house. It seems probable that Blake not only delineated the preliminary
                  sketch or wash drawing for the engraving, but also designed/invented the image of
                  the weather-house (but not the medallion of Cowper’s rabbits). Thus, the wood
                  engraving reproduced here belongs in the category of prints designed by Blake but
                  executed by another engraver within Blake’s lifetime, much like the plates in the
                  Paris 1799 ed. of <hi rend="i">Marie et Caroline</hi>, based on Blake’s plates
                  after his own designs first published in Mary Wollstonecraft’s <hi rend="i">Original Stories from Real Life</hi>, 1791 (for <hi rend="i">Marie et
                    Caroline</hi> see G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi>
                  [Oxford: Clarendon P, 1995] 265-69). In both instances, the engravings by other
                  hands were probably copied from the earlier plates both designed and executed by
                  Blake, not from his original drawings. Thus, the genre of re-engraving described
                  here should be distinguished from plates such as those in Robert Cromek’s 1808 ed.
                  of Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>, with engravings (not re-engravings) by Louis
                  Schiavonetti based on Blake’s original drawings commissioned by Cromek.<lb/><lb/>
                  The New York ed. of Hayley’s book also contains two engravings by Peter Maverick
                  (1780-1831) based on George Romney’s portrait of Cowper (1: frontispiece) and on
                  D. Heins’s portrait of Cowper’s mother (1: 3). Like the weather-house, these
                  plates were very probably copied after Blake’s larger engravings of the same
                  images in the London ed. These portraits constitute yet another (and decidedly
                  minor) genre: re-engravings based on plates originally executed by Blake after
                  designs by other artists. Bentley 577 notes Maverick’s contributions to the New
                  York ed. but does not record Anderson’s wood engraving after Blake.</figDesc>

              engraver Peter Maverick, appear in the New York, 1803, ed. of Hayley’s book (1:
              frontispiece and 1: facing p. 3).</p>

              based on this plate, in part designed by Blake, appears in the edition of Hayley’s
              book published in New York in 1803 (2: 245). The wood engraving is signed “Anderson
              F[ecit].” (Alexander Anderson, 1775-1870). See illus. 8 in this sales review.</p>

                Book</hi> (1814). At the time of writing the catalogue, I had not seen this volume
              and its frontispiece, attributed to Blake in the BMPR acquisition records. A copy of
              the book was sold at Sotheby’s London, 21 Nov. 1996, lot 146, for £2415. The catalogue
              includes a reproduction of the unsigned frontispiece in question. In my opinion, the
              plate was neither designed nor engraved by Blake, although I must admit that the image
              of a child holding a snake before an ogre within a crepuscular forest has a haunting,
              gothic quality not unlike some of Blake’s darker images of the fallen world (e.g., the
              color print of “Hecate”). According to Sotheby’s catalogue, the full title, publisher,
              and actual date of the book is <hi rend="i">The Minor’s Pocket Book, for the Youth of
                Both Sexes</hi> ([London]: Darton, Harvey and Darton, [1813]). The authorship is
              attributed to Ann Taylor “and others.”</p>

            </head>
            <p>This division is organized by individual (say, William Hayley or John Flaxman), with works by and about Blake’s friends and patrons, living individuals with whom he had significant direct and demonstrable contact. It includes Thomas Butts, Thomas Hartley Cromek, George Cumberland, John Flaxman and his family, Henry Fuseli, Thomas and William Hayley, John Linnell and his family, Samuel Palmer, James Parker, George Richmond, Thomas Stothard, and John Varley. It does <hi rend="i">not</hi> include important contemporaries with whom Blake’s contact was negligible or non-existent such as John Constable and William Wordsworth and Edmund Burke; such major figures are dealt with more comprehensively elsewhere, and the light they throw upon Blake is very dim.</p>
            <p>Reviews listed here are only for books which are substantially about Blake, not for those with only, say, a chapter on Blake. These reviews are listed under the book reviewed; the authors of the reviews may be recovered from the index.</p>
            <p>In general, Keiko Aoyama is responsible for works in Japanese, and I am greatly indebted to her for her meticulous accuracy and her patience in translating the words and conventions of Japan into our very different context.</p>
            <p>I take <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (1977) and <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> (1995), <hi rend="i">faute de mieux</hi>, to be the standard bibliographical authorities on Blake<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> and have noted significant differences from them. <note id="n1"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Except for the states of the plates for Blake’s commercial book engravings, where the standard authority is R.

            <p>The number of publications recorded on Blake in this checklist for 1996 is very considerable: over 160 essays, 136 reviews, 13 books on Blake, 14 editions of his poetry, and 10 exhibitions and catalogues of his work in languages as diverse as Catalan, Chinese, Czeck, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Scotch, Spanish, and Swedish. However, the flood of new publications is not nearly so great as this implies, for there are only 54 essays, 67 reviews, and nine books from 1996 recorded here. The even larger number of essays and reviews dating from 1784 to 1995 were first noticed in a variety of sources, chiefly <hi rend="i">English and General Literature Index</hi> for 1900-94 and the on-line catalogue of the Research Libraries Group.</p>
            <p>The 14 editions of Blake’s poetry newly noted here are mostly of small significance; editions of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> translated into Spanish (1987) and Chinese (1988), collections in Chinese (1973), Latvian (1981), Portuguese (1977), Russian (1993), and Scotch (1988), three broadsides (1930, 1968, 1980), and an “Office Drawn from” the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> and elsewhere in Blake “for Use of St. Mark’s in-the-Bourie” (1920). <hi rend="i">Selected Poems</hi> (1996) and <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence &amp; Experience</hi> [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] (1996) are insufficiently original for the publisher to bother to record the name of the editor. The only likely exception seems to be the two volumes of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, edited and translated by Marcello Pagnini (1994), which neither its Italian nor its English publisher seems to be able to supply and on which I can therefore scarcely comment.</p>
            <p>In terms of Blake’s original works, the most tantalizing is the discovery of a broken pair of spectacles in Blake’s cottage in Felpham which could have belonged to the poet.</p>
            <p>A good deal of new information about the earliest series of colored facsimiles of Blake’s works in illuminated printing by William Muir has been discovered in the Crookshank Collection in the West Sussex Record Office in Chichester. These give details of when copies were sold and which originals were reproduced. They also include fascinating inscriptions attributed to Blake from <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> (A) and <hi rend="i">Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> (F) and the allegation that <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (F) once belonged to Dante Gabriel Rossetti.</p>
            <p>Blake’s designs for Bunyan’s <hi rend="i">Pilgrim’s Progress</hi> have been sold by the Frick Collection in New York, where they were for half a century, and they are now in a private collection in England.</p>
            <p>Among Blake’s commercial book engravings, there are a good many new locations recorded here, and a facsimile has been published of George Cumberland’s <hi rend="i">Attempt to Describe Hafod</hi> (1996), though with no new information as to whether Blake had a hand in the engravings in it. And a great store of information about Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Essays on Physiognomy</hi>, in the archive of John Murray, not only demonstrates the conditions in which one of the most distinguished illustrated books of the century was produced but records what Blake was paid for his small part in the enormous undertaking.</p>
            <p>The most impressive and significant of the catalogues recorded here is Robin Hamlyn’s <hi rend="i">William Blake: visiones de mundos eternas</hi> for the 1996 exhibition in Madrid. Most of the essays except for Hamlyn’s are curiously irrelevant to Blake and to the pictures and books exhibited, but the works shown are extensive and of the first class, and the 180 color plates include complete reproductions of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> (X), <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (B), and Job. As there has been very little publication about Blake in Spanish before 1996, this is an astonishing accomplishment.</p>
            <p>A large proportion of the essays and reviews published on Blake in 1996<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> appeared in <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi>, in <hi rend="i">Journal of the Blake Society at St James</hi>, and in volumes of reprinted essays edited by Noriko Kawasaki and David Punter. One of the most rewarding of the new essays is that by Joseph Viscomi in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, displaying a vast range of new information about Blake’s faithful patron Thomas Butts. Among the fascinating conclusions derived from these facts is that when Butts ordered duplicates of Blake’s designs, he may have intended them for different houses he owned, one of them used for a school for a young ladies, and that the biblical subjects of many of these designs may have had a pedagogical function. <note id="n7"><hi rend="s">7</hi> N.b. As usual, I cannot, through linguistic ignorance, comment on the 25 essays published in Japan and the two in Korea.</note></p>
            <pb id="p30-123" n="123"/>
            <p><hi rend="i">Blake</hi> also serves Blake scholarship with its extensive reports of “Blake in the Marketplace” by Robert Essick and of “Blake and His Circle,” to which a whole issue is devoted.</p>
            <p>One especially rewarding essay is the one by Stuart Peterfreund in <hi rend="i">Eighteenth-Century Life</hi> (1994) with its argument about “Blake—Prophet Against Ideology.” Another is Stephen Prickett’s argument in his <hi rend="i">Origins of Narrative</hi> (1996) concerning “Swedenborg and Blake: The Privatisation of Angels.” And Karen Shabatai’s argument concerning “Blake’s Hostility Towards the Jews” in <hi rend="i">ELH</hi> (1996) raises disturbing issues which warrant serious reflection, though “Blake appears at best uninterested in the ‘Jewish question.’” Michael Grenfell makes an attractive though much overstated case in the <hi rend="i">Journal of the Blake Society of St James</hi> (1996) that “A Gnostic view is ‘the’ key to understanding Blake’s dense mythologies,” and G. E. Bentley, Jr. provides illuminating parallels between the careers of “James Parker and His Partner William Blake” in <hi rend="i">Studies in Bibliography</hi> (1996).</p>
            <p>There are the usual quota of attempts to consider Blake in terms of modern intellectual fashions like feminist theology, as well as a number of agreeable diversions. These include James Bogan’s “centrifugal lark” in “Blake on a Bike,” the “electronic concert dedicated to the life and work of William Blake,” and the Blake “Xword” (all in <hi rend="i">Journal of the Blake Society at St James</hi>). A few arguments seem particularly labored or perverse, such as Peter Ackroyd’s claim in <hi rend="i">The Independent</hi> (1993) and elsewhere that Blake was a “Cockney” (in the novel sense that he “expressed the true nature and spirit of London”). I should relish hearing that great London-lover Dr. Johnson respond to the allegation that he was a Cockney. Some arguments seem to be expiring, like Laocoön, in the grip of irresistible critical jargon, such as the claims that “Blake appropriates the homology between biological and non-biological creativity to address the politics of the copied text” (Julia Wright), that Molly Anne Rothenberg’s book is written “in post-structuralist and ‘post-post-structuralist’ terms,” and that in Jeanne Moskal’s book “the intrapsychic wins out over the intersubjective.”</p>
            <p>Though a number of critical books are newly recorded here, few have much pretension to novelty. Noriko Kawasaki’s <hi rend="i">Eden wa Kitaka:</hi> William Blake Ronshu: <hi rend="i">On the Location of Eden:</hi> Studies on William Blake (1996) reprints five of her essays in Japanese (1988-95), one of them translated from English for the purpose, and David Punter’s <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi> (1996) reprints 10 essays of 1970-87 by various authors. Victor Paananen’s <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi> (1996) is an “Updated Edition” of a modest little book first published in 1977. I have not been able to see, and therefore cannot comment on, Richard O’Keefe’s <hi rend="i">Mythic Archetypes in Ralph Waldo Emerson:</hi> A Blakean Reading (1995) (except to say that it is presumably a revised version of his dissertation), François Piquet’s <hi rend="i">Blake et le Sacré</hi> (1996) (ibid.) or William Richey’s <hi rend="i">Blake’s Altering Aesthetic</hi> (announced for November 1996).</p>
            <p>Violet Tengberg’s <hi rend="i">William Blake’s “The Tyger”:</hi> En konstvelenskaplig analys och tolkning (1994) is a study in Swedish of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, reproduced from typescript and of modest dimensions and pretensions.</p>
            <p>The two most substantial new critical books recorded here are Frank Vaughan’s <hi rend="i">Again to the Life of Eternity:</hi> William Blake’s Illustrations to the Poems of Thomas Gray (1996), with 139 folio pages and 116 plates, and Andrew Lincoln’s <hi rend="i">Spiritual History:</hi> A Reading of William Blake’s <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> or <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> (1995), a very substantial work though strangely unillustrated. Vaughan’s book, which reproduces all Blake’s watercolors for Gray in reduced size and monochrome, concludes very oddly that “Blake was not much interested in illustrating” Gray (7), even though he must have spent a great deal of the time on his designs for his good friend John Flaxman. Even more curiously, the Gray designs are said to have been intended to implant “not knowledge but a radical burning doubt” (18). These are strange conclusions for the poet who wrote:
<q>
He who shall teach the Child to Doubt<lb/>
The rotting Grave shall neer get out. . . .<lb/>
He who Doubts from what he sees<lb/>
Will neer Believe do what you Please.<lb/>
If the Sun &amp; Moon should doubt<lb/>
Theyd immediately go out.
</q>
One may suspect that the purpose discovered in the Gray designs. “To educate one to rebel” (116) and “to free the mind-forged manacles” (rather than “to free the manacled mind”) tells us more of what the critic wishes than of what the artist intended.</p>
            <p>Andrew Lincoln’s <hi rend="i">Spiritual History</hi> is an altogether more substantial and rewarding book, the most valuable critical work newly recorded here. It is a detailed “staged reading” of <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> or <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> designed for “new readers of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>” (v, ix) but rewarding for critics of all levels of experience and sophistication. One of its most valuable features is its analysis of the poem as “a universal history” (1), with the aid of illumination from contemporary historians such as Gibbon. The Last Judgment in the poem reveals that man’s prison “in a finite vision of the natural world” is a “prison locked from the inside” (190); we are the inmates of ourselves, and the key to escape is in our own hands. Andrew Lincoln’s <hi rend="i">Spiritual History</hi> is a work to which one can return repeatedly for light upon Blake’s poem—and upon the nature of humanity.</p>

                <p>According to the engraver Thomas Holloway, who supervised the plates for Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Essays on Physiognomy</hi>,
<q>
It was not long before TH found that in spite of all his Care &amp; even expostulations with most of the Artists—
<pb id="p30-131" n="131"/>
the work they brought home was distressingly inaccurate—many plates were destroyd totally—and those which were the best executed were frequently so errone[<hi rend="i">o</hi>]us both in outline &amp; expression that many parts were obligd <hi rend="i">to be hammerd out</hi> &amp; reproduced—a piece of work this the most painful &amp; the most mortyfying imaginable to TH— . . .<lb/>
A great number of the plates were necessarily repaird in some instances twice in a few instances 3 times making the plates equal to duplicates—which was the case with the Venus de Medicis &amp; others—without this attention the major part of the Impressions wou[l]d have been weak &amp; the Reputation of the work most materially injured . . .<lb/>
The work executed by TH &amp; others was in its Kind unique ....

                <p>The 537 copperplates for Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Physiognomy</hi> were sold to John Stockdale, who published an edition in 1810. After Stockdale’s death (1814), “<hi rend="i">the Remaining Stock of the Estate of the Late Mr. John Stockdale</hi>; consisting chiefly of Copper Plates, together with the Copyrights to the Works, to which they belong” was offered for sale at auction by Robert Saunders on 3 January 1818, and the “Five hundred and thirty-seven [copperplates]—Lavater’s Physiognomy, by Hunter, 4°, <hi rend="i">and Copyright</hi>” were sold for £210 (according to the marked copy in the British Library; no buyer is listed for any of the lots).</p>
                <p>Silent Reprint of the Book</p>
                <p>The plates were subsequently printed on paper watermarked as late as 1817 but dated 1792 on the titlepages and bearing the names of the original publishers but not that of the 1817 buyer of the copperplates. Perhaps the new owner discovered belatedly that the copyright he had acquired was for the plates only and did not include the copyright of Dr. Henry Hunter’s translation of Lavater. He may therefore have decided that it was safest to conceal the date and to pretend that this was the original edition.</p>
