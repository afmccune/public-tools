        <byline><docAuthor><hi rend="b">ROBERT N. </hi><name><hi rend="b">ESSICK</hi></name></docAuthor> WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF <docAuthor><hi rend="b">THOMAS V. </hi><name><hi rend="b">LANGE</hi></name></docAuthor></byline>
        <p>Since my last survey of sales (<hi rend="i">Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly</hi>, Vol. 12, Summer 1978, pp. 26-38), it has become increasingly clear that there is no single Blake market, amenable to easy summary, but several. Eash has its own distinct economics, group of buyers and sellers, and importance for academic Blakeans.</p>
        <p>The stratospheric heights, beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest, have been represented during the last two years by the auction sale of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> copy D (illus. 1) and the two large tempera panels, "Evening" and "Winter." The first, knocked down for $147,000 (plus the 10% surcharge now required by both Sotheby’s and Christie’s), not only is a record for any work by Blake, but according to Christie’s is the most ever paid for a single work of English literature. Unfortunately (for the sellers) the several other illuminated books sold in 1978 and 1979 changed hands before this landmark auction. It should have considerable impact on future sales of fine illuminated books, few of which still lie in private hands; but less influence on prices for individual relief etchings and I suspect practically none on other types of Blake books. The high prices for the temperas (£30,000 for "Winter" and £21,000 for "Evening") were at least in part due to the medium, generally considered by the art world to be, like oil, more important than water color. That Blake’s so-called "temperas" were probably executed in nothing more than a thicker variety of Blake’s gum- or glue-fixed water color makes little difference in this context. The price for "Winter" is probably a new auction record for a painting by Blake and will tend to push up the monetary value of his other important pictures. Yet, if we compare this price to those fetched by even the second rank of old masters or important eighteenth-century continental artists, Blake looks like a bargain. His drawings and paintings still find their market among rather bookish sorts or collectors who concentrate on British art and have little appeal outside the English speaking world. If Blake should ever become part of the international art market and achieve the popularity and reputation of such masters as Frederick Remington or Andy Warhol, prices would soar.</p>
        <p>The scene is very different if we look at the other end of the Blake picture market. The drawing "Non Angli Sed Angeli" did fairly well at £2200, at least in part because it is closely associated with the important finished water color in the Victoria and Albert. Yet prices for equally important drawings have actually descended—precipitously so if calculated in uninflated money. A case in point is "Every Man also Gave Him a Piece of Money" (illus. 2) formerly in the Robertson and Preston collections. Colnaghi offered it for £15,000 in their fall 1976 exhibition, but the drawing was stolen on the last day of the show. Recovered by the insurance company, the drawing was offered at Sotheby’s with an estimate of £10,000 to £15,000. The drawing’s lot number is not given in the price list, and thus it apparently failed to meet the reserve, which could not have been higher than the low estimate. Dealers continue to ask high prices for such works, but the auction record shows the true thinness and weakness of this market. Lesser works have fared even worse.
<pb id="p14-5" n="5"/>
After the high prices fetched in June 1971 for leaves from the Blake-Varley Sketchbook, seven years later one would think that even a counterproof would bring more than the £45 paid for "Queen Eleanor." A similar counterproof of "Canute" went for £150 in 1976.</p>
        <p>Impressions of Blake’s intaglio engravings have fluctuated considerably, in part according to availability. Commercial engravings plucked from books have risen sharply, but their price was so low only a few years ago that 100% increases do not carry them very far in absolute terms. "Christ Trampling on Urizen" demonstrates the effects of over-supply. There would seem to be a cache of posthumous impressions somewhere, but its owner has not been releasing them slowly enough and the auction prices have steadily descended. One of the first to appear on the auction market in many years brought £189 in October 1975; the most recent sold for £15 in February 1979. Even major series such as the Job and Dante illustrations have not increased much on the average, and one can pick out individual sales that show a decline. For example, in July 1974 a complete set of the Dante made £3,700 in London; another copy of the 1892 printing, with a bit more foxing, brought £3200 in December 1979. A complete proof copy of the Job sold at a London auction in December 1973 for £3200; a similar set brought $5000 in a New York sale, May 1978. The Job—one of the greatest works of line engraving produced in any age—is my candidate for the most underpriced work by an English artist. If the market gave it a monetary value commensurate with its aesthetic value, as it does for Durer, Rembrandt, and Goya, the price should be in the neighborhood of $20,000.</p>
        <p>The Blake book market, excluding original copies of the illuminated books, is more orderly than those already described. A few items, such as the <hi rend="i">Wit’s Magazine</hi>, suddenly take off for no apparent reason, but gradual rises are the rule. Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life of Blake</hi>, 1863 and 1880, and almost all titles by Sir Geoffrey Keynes, have more than outpaced the general rate of inflation. The best performers among books with Blake’s engravings have been the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>—including the enormous record price of $18,150 for a beautifully colored copy—and titles that have always brought good prices, such as Hunter’s <hi rend="i">Narrative</hi> and Stuart &amp; Revett’s <hi rend="i">Antiquities of Athens</hi>, for reasons other than their Blake associations. Quaritch has made certain that the prices for out-of-print Blake Trust items continue their steady ascent by purchasing copies that come up at auction and offering them for sale at prices a little above the rest of the market. Their price of $4000 for the 1951 <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> is a new record for any Blake Trust volume. Important early reprints of Blake’s poems, particularly those published by Pickering, have fared well. Yet, there is nothing in the record of sales to support the common opinion, held by many dealers as well as collectors, that any book bearing Blake’s name automatically soars in price above all other publications.</p>
        <p>The following compilation of Blake sales for 1978-1979 (along with a few late 1977 and early 1980 items) follows the same format as previous lists, with the addition of a concluding section on selected out-of-print secondary materials. We hope that this new section will help individuals and libraries determine appropriate prices for volumes they wish to add to their research and reference collections.</p>

          <p><hi rend="i">America.</hi> Pl. 7 only, printed in sepia. Described as a posthumous impression, but the texture of ink, color, and wiping of the borders all indicate a pull by Blake himself. Signature on verso of John Defett Francis, 1834.

          <p>Anyone who missed the Flaxman exhibition but wanted a lively introduction to the man and his works might be well (if anachronistically) advised to begin with a replay of the Schorn interview, extracts from which are given in the exhibition catalogue. The German art historian and journalist Ludwig Schorn visited the aging sculptor in the spring of 1826; from notes made at the time, he compiled reminiscences published as a series of three articles in the <hi rend="i">Kunst-Blatt</hi> a year later, after Flaxman’s death.</p>
          <p>Schorn presents his encounter with Flaxman with a skill which many of our contemporary television interviewers might learn from. Having long admired Flaxman as the draughtsman of those outlines to Homer, Aeschylus and Dante which, through engravings, had already secured Flaxman’s European reputation, Schorn secures a personal introduction to him. Arriving in London, he prepares for his interview by going to see (and through his enthusiastic but not uncritical descriptions showing us, almost as if he had a television camera at his command) works by Flaxman currently on display: sculptures such as the Nelson Monument in St. Paul’s and the Mansfield Monument in Westminster Abbey, models for busts of Raphael and Michelangelo in the Royal Academy’s newly-opened exhibition, and, in the silversmiths’ shop on Ludgate Hill of Messrs. Rundell &amp; Bridge ("suppliers of costly and tastefully executed deluxe vessels") a copy of the Achilles Shield. Ornamented with episodes from the <hi rend="i">Iliad</hi> and acclaimed as a "masterpiece of modern art," designed and modeled by the master himself but cast and chased in metal by the firm’s workers, four replicas had already been made in silver, for the King, the Duke of York, the Duke of Northumberland and Lord Lonsdale ("gilded, the article costs 2000 pounds, ungilded 1900. In bronze it is to be had for 450 pounds . . . "). Having done his ground-work, Schorn goes to Flaxman’s house off Fitzroy Square ("a small, simple house, but nice and well-kept": just what one might expect from a plain-living Low Churchman) to meet the great man himself. After a short wait in the drawing-room, "a very small, thin and exceedingly hunched man" came in (Flaxman, never robust, had been a cripple from youth). Schorn quickly perceives that this unprepossessing exterior radiates "mildness," "seriousness" and "sweetness of conduct." He begins by avowing his long admiration for Flaxman’s outlines to Homer and Aechylus: Flaxman remarks that they have been over-praised, adding that artists who imitated them (and they were by now as much part of an artist’s training as Le Brun’s <hi rend="i">Physiognomy</hi>) "would have done better to follow nature." Schorn leads Flaxman on to his role as Professor of Sculpture at the Royal Academy: Flaxman declares that his purpose both as artist and teacher has been to show that "Art in Christianity can rise higher than in paganism, since Christian ideas are more sublime than pagan ones." Cut to Flaxman’s workshop, where the sculptor uncovers a clay model of the figure of Hope, "still damp," on which he is currently working: Schorn notes the sensitivity of the modeling, which achieves tenderness without sentimentality.</p>
          <p>Discussion of Flaxman’s art then develops along two main lines: the relative importance of classical and Christian themes in his art, and the extent (if any) to which he worked from nature. Admiring two small reliefs of Justice and Innocence in the workshop, Schorn praises the naturalness and simplicity of their poses, and exclaims "One sees here how the gifted mind may find enough beauties
<pb id="p14-23" n="23"/>
and motives in nature, and once arrived at the realization of beauty, have no need to imitate the ancients." He has struck absolutely the right chord: "in a particularly melodious voice and with a cheerful look which seemed to project the inner-most depths of his soul," Flaxman responds with his credo: "The works of God are always better than the works of man, and nature, even if imperfect in particulars, still remains forever unattainable. The artist unites in his works the most beautiful he has seen in it: yet it is not the beauty of nature that is the highest but that of the idea . . . All the beauty which we can portray is . . . individual, not merely because it appears only individually in nature itself, but because it also results from the character peculiar to the artist and is, as it were, the blossoming of noble powers which are laid on him and which he must carefully preserve and develop."</p>
          <p>Chief honor for initiating and presenting an exhibition in which Flaxman’s "noble powers" were shown in all possible aspects belongs to Ludwig Schorn’s latterday compatriot Dr. Werner Hofmann, Director of the Kunsthalle in Hamburg, where the exhibition was first shown (20 April to 3 June 1979) as one of Professor Hofmann’s great series of exhibitions devoted to "Kunst um 1800." It was then seen at the Thorvaldsen Museum in Copenhagen, and finally (26 October to 9 December 1979) at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Professor Hofmann was fortunate in being able to count on the assistance of Dr. David Bindman, both in helping to select an exhibition of 260 works and (no doubt a heavier task) in coordinating the work of thirteen Flaxman scholars in his capacity as editor of a catalogue which now becomes the most comprehensive work on Flaxman ever published.</p>
          <p>In his introductory essay, Dr. Bindman predicted that the chief surprise for visitors to the exhibition would be the range of Flaxman’s activity. It was certainly true that the stuff of the objects shown ranged from paper through plaster and wax to marble, and from pottery to bronze, silver and gold; and each of the materially-different sections of the exhibition, which included "Flaxman as sculptor," "Flaxman and Wedgwood," "Flaxman and designs for medals and coins" and "Flaxman as a designer of silverwork," was intelligently selected and catalogued. But two reservations concerning "the range of Flaxman’s activity" insistently obtrude themselves. First, although Flaxman’s style is invariably graceful and often moving, it was not profoundly original in inspiration. Its elements were taken initially from his study of Greek vase painting, Roman sarcophagi and Gothic sculpture: Flaxman’s own contribution lay in deploying these elements, freshly and inventively, in sensitive and restrained designs infused with moral sentiments. Secondly, "the range of Flaxman’s activity" does not mean that all the works connected with his name (even the products of his own sculpture workshop) were produced by his own hand. Flaxman was in fact primarily a designer. He was always aware, in whatever he drew, that he was designing potentially plastic shapes: but through whose hands and in what various materials they took eventual form was of less importance to him than the cultivation

of his own role as the originator of "severely beautiful" designs. In a particularly telling passage (p. 26), Dr. Bindman instances Flaxman’s confidence in the "transferability" of his designs as typical of "the tendency among Neoclassical artists (partly in reaction against the Baroque concern to please the eye) to disdain material as being of less importance than the ‘idea’."</p>
          <p>We first see Flaxman’s designs taking shape in the hands of Wedgwood’s potters. Wedgwood &amp; Bentley opened their factory at Etruria in 1769, aiming to produce ornamental wares in a "truer antique taste." A few years later, scouting for talent among London plaster-cast makers (of whom Flaxman’s father was one) in the hope of finding something "less hackneyed" than the usual copies or squeezes from classical, French or Italian sources, Wedgwood found that young Flaxman could produce remarkably elegant designs which, though chiefly variations on the classical theme, had a new grace and simplicity which connoisseurs such as Sir William Hamilton pronounced to be in the "true simple antique style." Flaxman was to work for Wedgwood for some fifteen years, the connection providing him with financial stability through the 1770s and 1780s and making possible his departure for Italy in 1787.</p>
          <p>The minimal extent to which Flaxman was involved in the actual production process is succinctly summarized by Bruce Tattersall, former Curator of the Wedgwood Museum. Flaxman would send Wedgwood a drawing of his proposed design; Wedgwood would return it with notes of any necessary alterations. "Flaxman would then send Wedgwood a wax model of the design. At this stage Flaxman’s involvement would cease. Once Wedgwood obtained the wax it became his property and he could do as he wished with it." Specialist modelers at Etruria would adapt the wax for reproduction, frequently simplifying or breaking up the design into component parts. Whether Flaxman’s designs for Wedgwood eventually materialized in blue, green or lilac jasper or in black basalt, or whether his design of "The Dancing Hours" was used to decorate a rum kettle or a salt cellar (examples of both were exhibited) was beyond Flaxman’s control; luckily it also seems to have been beyond his concern. Similarly with his designs for coins, medals and silverwork; the executants were craftsmen whom Flaxman in most cases never encountered. In these sections, then, we chiefly saw Flaxman’s work at one remove, and not always to full advantage, just as Schorn had seen the Achilles Shield, sensing that the thing was "permeated by a genuine spirit of antiquity," but left wondering to what extent a "somewhat superficial" execution betrayed the absence of the master’s hand.</p>
          <p>"The master’s hand" was not even responsible for the final form of the monumental sculptures which provided Flaxman with most of his commissions. The point is fairly made by Mary Webster in her essay on "Flaxman as sculptor" (pp. 100-01). "Greatly admired for his sensitive work with the modelling tool, Flaxman was less adept with the chisel and he worked very little on the actual marbles; he adopted, in fact, the pernicious practice of handing over the entire execution of the marble to workmen in his studio. The sometimes flat and dull execution which resulted robs more than a few of his marbles of the merit of a fully-realized execution." But as she points out, there was an intermediary stage between the design and the execution by which Flaxman’s gifts as a sculptor should more fairly be judged. This stage was the fashioning, in Flaxman’s own hands, of a small sketch-model in clay, later cast in plaster.</p>
          <p>It is in these sketch-models that Flaxman’s sensitivity and poetic gifts as a sculptor are most fully demonstrated. He himself realized that these models were the fullest expression of his powers, for he kept them in their hundreds round the walls of his studio (they are now chiefly in the collection of University College, London). A judicious selection of them was exhibited, including the model for "Come thou blessed," the monument to Agnes Cromwell in Chichester Cathedral, which Flaxman himself called "one of my favourites" (illus. 1): its gently soaring rhythms are a deeply poetic expression of Christian faith.</p>
          <p>Inevitably (for one could hardly expect large-scale monuments to be dismantled from cathedrals for exhibition) only three finished works in marble were shown in the exhibition: the Royal Academy’s own charming bas-relief "Apollo and Marpessa" of c. 1790-94, later presented as Flaxman’s diploma work; the Thorvaldsen Museum’s strictly Neoclassical but (for Flaxman) almost sensuous bust of Henry Philip Hope, c. 1801-03, a sitter then in the prime of life; and the marble relief monument to George Steevens (d. 1800) from St. Matthias, Poplar, complete with William Hayley’s epitaph. In its attempt to echo the departed’s own attitude to life ("Lightly the stage of chequer’d life he trod"), the Steevens monument (illus. 2) was probably the most light-hearted work in the exhibition, though the nearest approximation to "light-hearted" allowed for it in the catalogue was "genial." Few smiles occur in Flaxman’s work, as Hayley had already found when commissioning a medallion (not included in the exhibition) of his illegitimate son Tom: would it not be possible, he suggested, "to add a little gay juvenility to the features, without producing (what I by all means wish to avoid) a <hi rend="i">Grin</hi> or a <hi rend="i">Smirk</hi>?" But Flaxman was not in his profession to produce smiles, let along grins; even his domestic scenes are of affliction rather than bliss.</p>
          <p>It is to Flaxman’s drawings, even more than to his sketch-models, that one must look for the most intimate expression of his ideas. Luckily, drawings ran like life-giving blood through almost the entire exhibition, revivifying images which had taken shape in other media and often revealing astonishingly inventive and imaginative powers. Paper thus became, in a very real sense, the most important material in the exhibition, though hardly the most colorful: most of Flaxman’s drawings are in pencil or pen and ink, sometimes with a wash—Flaxman’s work in full watercolor is extremely rare, and only one example (no. 152) was included. Flaxman’s early drawings revealed influences from Mortimer, Barry, Fuseli and Blake. They included the highly-finished self-portrait (illus. 3) and the remarkable study for
<pb id="p14-27" n="27"/><figure><head>4 "Study of a woman and child," pen, 140 × 111 cm.</head><figDesc>University College, London.</figDesc></figure><pb id="p14-28" n="28"/><figure><head>5 "A sleeping man," pen, 57 × 105 cm.</head><figDesc>University College, London.</figDesc></figure>
"Chatterton receiving a bowl of poison from Despair," the high point of Flaxman’s youthful romantic style, in which Sarah Symmons (surely correctly) has detected Flaxman’s features in Chatterton’s face; they also included medieval subjects taken from such works as Percy’s <hi rend="i">Reliques</hi>, of the sort Blake too was painting at this time. Two early drawings by Blake, "Edward III and the Black Prince" and "The Death of Ezekiel’s Wife," were included here for comparison. David Bindman, who provides perceptive commentaries on Flaxman’s drawings throughout the catalogue, points out that the early drawings have a poetic and atmospheric quality which Flaxman never regained after experiencing "the severity of the antique" in Rome.</p>
          <p>The Italian drawings of 1789-94 included the small but nobly-proportioned study of a woman and child (illus. 4) which proved capable of sustaining enlargement into an impeccable Neoclassical image for the Kunsthalle’s exhibition poster. (In choosing a poster to advertize the London showing, the Royal Academy’s exhibitions staff elected rather over-fulsomely to acknowledge generous support from the firm of Wedgwood: instead of the Kunsthalle’s powerful and appropriate design, Burlington House’s railings and London Transport’s walls displayed the chessmen designed by Flaxman for Wedgwood in 1785, Gothic "toys" magnified not only out of all proportion to their purpose but also to the relative importance in Flaxman’s long career of his work for Wedgwood.) The "Sleeping Man" (illus. 5) was described, fairly enough, as "one of the most spontaneous of Flaxman’s Roman life studies": but few of Flaxman’s drawings, whether made in Rome or at any other time, were as directly observed as this. Observations from life may have kindled Flaxman’s imagination, but almost all his drawings are refined from life rather than studied directly from it, and almost all of them evince the sculptor’s instinct to model his subject-matter, to redesign, rearrange and interlock its shapes. The results can be exciting, even on the tiny scale of his studies of women and children; they can be deeply moving, as in the designs for "The Lord’s Prayer" and the "Acts of Mercy" (see illus. 6); but they are invariably deliberately generalized and potentially monumental.</p>
          <p>Flaxman himself stressed that the designs for which he was most celebrated in his own time, the outlines to Homer, Aeschylus and Dante, were primarily made as compositions on which sculptures could be based. He wrote to William Hayley on 26 October 1793 that "My view does not terminate in giving a few outlines to the world. My intention is to shew how any story may be represented in a series of compositions on principles of the Antients, of which, as soon as I return to England, I intend to give specimens in Sculpture of different kinds, in groups of basrelieves, suited to all the purposes of Sacred and Civil architecture." Flaxman never in fact converted his outlines to sculpture; nevertheless, those outlines, engraved by Piroli and
<pb id="p14-29" n="29"/><figure><head>6 "Deliver the Captive," for <hi rend="i">The Acts of Mercy</hi>, 144 × 327 cm.</head><figDesc>The British Museum.</figDesc></figure>
first published by him in 1793, quickly secured Flaxman’s fame throughout Europe. The exhibition showed selections both of Flaxman’s drawings and Piroli’s engravings. The excitement felt throughout Europe on first looking into Flaxman’s outlines (especially in the form of Piroli’s rather genteel and monotonous line) is now difficult to recapture; but there is abundant evidence for the stimulus given to contemporary artists by these starkly dramatic sequences. "Cet ouvrage fera faire des tableaux," David remarked. An important section of the exhibition (compiled by Sarah Symmons) illustrated the ways in which they provided inspiration for artists as different from each other as Ingres, Delacroix, Runge and Goya. Two works by Blake were included in this section, "The Hypocrites with Caiaphas" and "The Circle of the Lustful"; but it was decided to confine the coverage of Flaxman’s influence chiefly to the continent, as a separate exhibition devoted to Flaxman’s influence in England is projected. Perhaps the most bizarre suggestion for using Flaxman’s outlines was to come in 1863 from G. F. Watts, who suggested that they should be painted on the walls of public schools, so that "the young men of Eton would grow up under the influence of works of beauty of the highest excellence."</p>
          <p>Any present-day jaded appetite for Flaxman’s outlines may be whetted by a delightful spin-off from the exhibition entitled <hi rend="i">Superflax</hi>: <hi rend="i">Zorrrrrrrn (Idee</hi>: Homer; <hi rend="i">Zeichnungen</hi>: John Flaxman; <hi rend="i">Buch und Regie</hi>: Achim Lipp; paperback, 25pp.). Published under the auspices of the Hamburger Kunsthalle, this presented Flaxman’s outlines to Homer as a lively adventure strip, taking a few liberties (such as reversing occasional details of the engravings to emphasize a clash of arms or the thundering of hooves) but recapturing much excitement. The witty (but not facetious) text was in German. The book was not available at the Royal Academy exhibition: should some enterprizing publisher essay an English edition?</p>
          <p>A brief tabulated survey of the chief editions of engravings after Flaxman’s outlines published between 1793 and 1845 (pp. 184-5 of the exhibition catalogue) testifies to their wide circulation. Compiled by Detlef W. Doerrbecker, with acknowledgments to Gerald E. Bentley Jr.’s study of 1964, it draws on further material kindly supplied by Professor Bentley from his new and greatly expanded edition of <hi rend="i">The Early Engravings of Flaxman’s Classical Designs</hi>, publication of which is expected shortly.</p>
          <p>Flaxman’s outlines to Hesiod’s <hi rend="i">Theogony</hi>, begun in 1807, engraved by Blake in 37 stippled line engravings and published in 1817 (no. 155 in the exhibition) attracted little of the attention received by the outlines to Homer, Aeschylus and Dante. Blake at this period was undergoing a period of extreme neglect and poverty. Throughout his life he received none of the fame which accrued to Flaxman. This is not, after all, surprising. Flaxman gave his contemporaries what they (or at least connoisseurs among them) considered to be in the best possible taste, especially where commemoration of the dead was concerned. His vision of eternity did not extend beyond that of accepted Christian teaching; he was untouched by mysticism, and not temperamentally inclined towards exuberance. His morality was unimpeachable and, above all, it was readily intelligible. Blake’s work by contrast seemed to his contemporaries to be unconventional and worse, unintelligible; few of them bothered to discern that (in Dibdin’s phrase) Blake was "flapped by the wings of seraphs."</p>

          <p>NOTE: Several years ago, in <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi> 28, we published a short piece by Robert M. Ryan on Blake’s phrase "poisonous blue," concerning some of the chemical properties of the painter’s pigment "prussian blue." Soon we received a letter from Ruthven Todd giving us his preliminary thoughts on the matter and promising, as Ruthven’s letters always did, further thoughts in publishable form. After his death in 1979, the following unfinished draft was found among his papers. THE EDITORS.</p>

          </head>
          <p>As a consistent contributor to "Minute Particulars" I feel somewhat abashed in querying or even contradicting any other contributor, so I hope that Robert M. Ryan will accept my apologies in advance.</p>
          <p>For a man whose principal occupation has been that of a writer, I have spent a possibly unreasonable amount of my life experimenting with and using the tools and materials of the graphic artist. Abetted by my friends, particularly S. W. Hayter, Joan Miró, Fred Becker and the late Harry Hoehn, I have engraved and etched, learning how to handle a burin and how to behave with acids, for more years than I like to recall. Most of my interest in the techniques having been historical, I had never, until the spring of 1974 (when I made some experiments with Harvey Breverman and his associates at Buffalo) tried zinc or any other etchable material, such as magnesium or iron. So my experience practically, and visually, can be said to be that of a worker in copper.</p>
          <p>The basic mordant used in the biting of copper is Nitric acid (HNO<hi rend="s">3</hi>), prepared as follows, according to that standard work, S. W. Hayter, <hi rend="i">New Ways of Gravure</hi>, Oxford University Press, London, New York, Toronto, 1966, p. 57: "1 part nitric acid to 2 parts water. There should be some copper in the solution or the acid will not bite regularly. Some old acid may be added; or a copper penny dropped in for a few minutes until the acid is coloured blue. Nitric acid reacts with copper to produce bubbles of nitric oxide gas."</p>
          <p>The virulence of this brilliant blue liquid, from which the fumes curl off, as the copper is bitten, in yellowish-brown purlings, has always suggested to me that this was the "poisonous blue" with which "They stain’d him" on Plate 65 of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> I knew that the acid destroyed clothing easily and that my skin, over-dipped in the stuff, and inadequately washed, peeled off in vegetative or seaweed-like strips of autumnal coloring. I also knew that the fumes hurt my breathing during the long bitings which I used when experimenting with Joan Miró.</p>
          <p>Now it seems to me that, firstly, since I will not live forever, and, secondly, the information should be immediately available, I should go beyond the assumption which I had, and give away whatever information I have at hand or can remember.</p>
          <p>For a start, and in support of my belief that nitric acid was, indeed, the "poisonous blue," I have looked up and quote from W. F. von Oettingen, M. D., Ph. D., <hi rend="i">Poisoning A Guide to Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment</hi>, Second Edition, W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, London, 1963, p. 454: "Nitric acid is a clear colorless, fuming, corrosive liquid, which upon contact with air and exposure to light turns yellow to brown-red because of formation of nitrogen oxide. [This, of course, makes no allowance for the bluing action of copper]. The reagent grade nitric acid [used by etchers] contains 68 to 70 per cent and the ‘diluted’ nitric acid, 10 per cent of nitric acid. Nitric acid is used in many industries and trades and in medicine as a caustic agent. Its contact with the skin causes yellow discoloration (xanthoprotein reaction), very painful inflammation, blisters, necroses, and gangrene. Prolonged exposure to the fumes of nitric acid causes discoloration and corrosion of the teeth. Splashes in the eye cause severe conjunctivitis, palpebral edema, ulceration of the conjunctiva and cornea, and subsequently turbidity of the latter. The inhalation of the fumes causes more or less severe irritation of the upper respiratory tract."</p>
          <p>While "There is no chronic copper poisoning analogous to that of lead," it should be remembered that copper, particularly in its various combinations with other substances, is also a poison. When I was young and the modern pesticides or parasiticides had not yet appeared, those who were unlucky enough to be attacked by the crab louse, <hi rend="i">Phthirus pubis</hi> (which, according to <hi rend="i">The Merck Manual</hi>, Twelfth Edition, Rahway, N. J., 1972, p. 1457, <hi rend="i">is</hi> acquirable "from such objects as toilet seats, clothing, and bedclothes") used to go to a chemist’s and buy, for a few pence, a jar of "blue ointment" with which to rout the invaders. This was Cupric Sulfate, also known as copper sulfate, blue vitriol and blue stone, and commonly understood to be a solution of copper in dilute sulfuric acid. While it is no longer listed as a cure for crabs, it still retains its place in <hi rend="i">United States Dispensatory and Physicians’ Pharmacology</hi>, 26th Edition, J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia &amp; Toronto, 1967, p. 343, for, among other uses, its value in abolishing algae from swimming pools.</p>
          <p>I think I have shown that copper, in combination with acids, is not only blue but also poisonous. I could, with access to a larger library than I have here in Spain, probably extend the matter, with gruesome details, but feel that to do so would be to attempt to blue the Mediterranean. Further, I cannot think of any liquid blue capable of staining
<pb id="p14-32" n="32"/>
and also leaving the impression of vegetation, in the peeling strands of yellow-grown skin, which Blake could have meant except the nitric acid, colored with copper, which he used all his working life.</p>

            <p>By chance it happens that the other blues, with two exceptions, which could have been known to Blake are reasonably innocuous. In this part, I am going to have to rely very largely upon that most important book, Rosamond D. Harley, <hi rend="i">Artists’ Pigments c. 1600-1835 A Study in English Documentary Sources</hi>, London, Butterworths, 1970, and I am going to steal from it in the most unashamed way since it seems that my effort to say how important it is, in <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi>, 4 (August 1970), has passed unnoticed. All references to Harley are, unless specified as coming from personal correspondence, to this book.</p>
            <p>To dispose, first of all, of the matter of Prussian Blue, I am going to give Dr. Harley’s entry on this from her book, pp. 65-68. [In all my quotations from Rosamond Harley and, later, Geoffrey Grigson, I have omitted their references to their sources, not only because such an action saves space, but also because I think that students should also investigate them, as nobody knows what peripheral material may prove to be pertinent.]</p>
            <q>
Prussian blue, potassium ferric ferrocyanide, has been described as ‘the first of the artificial pigments with a known history and an established date of preparation’.<hi rend="s">97</hi> However, the idea that a definite date may be associated with it may be a modern misconception. It is true that the circumstances of its accidental discovery were reported by Stahl some years after the event and that his account has been referred to many times since, but it is noticeable that throughout the period up to 1835 every writer who mentions any date in connection with the pigment states that it was discovered <hi rend="i">circa</hi> 1710, whereas the date, 1704, given by so many later writers was not mentioned until the late nineteenth century. Earlier writers based the date on the knowledge that the pigment had been advertised for sale in Berlin in 1710 and on the words of the German chemist, Stahl, whose account of the discovery was printed in 1731. He wrote of it as occurring by chance twenty years previously ‘<hi rend="i">ante quatuor forte lustra</hi>’ (one <hi rend="i">lustrum</hi> being a period of five years). Unfortunately, nineteenth-century and twentieth-century writers who quote the date 1704 fail to state the source on which their information is based, and, in the absence of new evidence, any enquiry into the date of the discovery must begin with an examination of the remainder of Stahl’s account: he mentions two people, Diesbach the colour-maker who made the discovery and Dippel the alchemist who supplied some of the raw materials, and he states that both were resident in Berlin. Dippel did not live there permanently, however; an eighteenth-century biography contains the information that just before 1704 he was in Giessen and Darmstadt, and, after some time, he went to Berlin. From there he went to Frankfurt-am-Main and then moved on to Holland at the end of 1707.<hi rend="s">98</hi> This evidence suggests that the discovery of Prussian blue could have been made at any time between 1704 and 1707. A modern authority states that Dippel is known to have been practising chemistry in Berlin in 1705.<hi rend="s">39</hi><lb/><lb/>
Stahl’s account of Prussian blue was written because the fortuitous nature of its discovery appealed to him. The chance manufacture of the pigment resulted indirectly from Dippel’s production of an animal oil which was used medicinally; in the purification process the oil was distilled over some potash which was then treated as waste. Diesbach, who used to make Florence lake from cochineal, alum, English vitriol (ferrous sulphate) and a fixed alkali, ran short of alkali and asked Dippel for some of the potash which he saw had been thrown away. He was allowed to use it, and, after he had proceeded by his usual method, the lake appeared to be very pale. When he attempted to concentrate it, it turned purple and then deep blue. Diesbach returned to Dippel for an explanation and was told that the potash was tainted with animal matter. Stahl’s account concludes with the comment that for some considerable time the pigment was made only in Berlin.<hi rend="s">100</hi><lb/><lb/>
Details of the manufacturing process were kept secret until 1724, when an account was sent from Germany to Woodward in England who allowed it to be published in <hi rend="i">Philosophical Transactions.</hi> The instructions were lengthy, but the method can be summarised as follows. To an alkali calcined with bullock’s blood, dissolved and brought to boiling point, a solution of alum and ferrous sulphate was added while also boiling. During the effervescence which followed the mixture turned green, and, after it had been allowed to stand, it was strained. The residual greenish precipitate turned blue as soon as spirit of salt (hydrochloric acid) was poured on it. The pigment was then left to stand and was washed several times with pure water the next day, after which it was filtered and dried under gentle heat.<hi rend="s">101</hi> Woodward’s communication was written in Latin and it doubtless became common knowledge quite quickly. By the 1730s manufacture of Prussian blue was widespread, as Shaw states in his <hi rend="i">Chemical Lectures</hi>, which contain manufacturing instructions in English: ‘The Method of making this Prussian Blue in perfection, has been held and purchased as a very valuable Secret, both in England, Germany and elsewhere; but it is now got into several hands.’<hi rend="s">102</hi> No evidence has been found concerning the early manufacture of the pigment in England, nor has it been possible to verify statements concerning early manufacture which appear in nineteenth-century and twentieth-century works. For example, a number of modern writers give the impression that a colour-maker named Wilkinson was the first English manufacturer and that Wilkinson’s
<pb id="p14-33" n="33"/>
blue became a synonym for Prussian blue. The information can be traced back to Hurst writing in the late nineteenth century, but he merely states that Wilkinson developed the pigment.<hi rend="s">103</hi> Literary sources of the eighteenth century contain no evidence that the name Wilkinson’s blue was ever used by artists. Colour names listed by Field in the nineteenth century are Berlin blue, Parisian blue and cyanide of iron. The origin of the first and last is obvious, and the second can be explained by the fact that a good quality blue was made in Paris. During the second half of the eighteenth century, considerable research was undertaken by French chemists in order to analyse the pigment and extend its use to the dyeing industry.<hi rend="s">104</hi><lb/><lb/>
Although Prussian blue was at one time used as a dye, it must be emphasised that it was originally advertised in 1710 as a pigment for artists’ use. Following a summary of the limitations of other available blues, the notice in <hi rend="i">Miscellanca Berolinensia</hi> contained the announcement that the new blue which had been discovered a few years previously had been subjected to accurate tests. It was said to be absolutely durable in either oil or water colour and totally unaffected by nitric acid, fire or exposure to air. It could be ground to an impalpable powder and easily tempered with a knife, so it was suitable for miniature painters and oil painters alike; in addition, its softness meant that it would brush out well and mix easily with any other colour. Its versatility was such that, at full saturation, it was useful in painting shadows and, when thinned, it could be used as a lighter and brighter colour without any need for tinting with white. A great recommendation was its non-poisonous quality; it was said to be made from a kind of sugar so that it was edible, which meant that beginners could safely lick their brushes as they were liable to do. Finally, its price was attractive, being scarcely one-tenth that of ultramarine.<hi rend="s">105</hi><lb/><lb/>
Following the extravagant claims of the original manufacturer, one might expect the pigment to have been acclaimed immediately by artists, but such was not the case. Dossie states that anyone desiring permanent Prussian blue should prepare it himself instead of buying the pigment from a shop, because the commercial sort varied in strength and was unreliable. He further states that it can be used in all techniques except enamel, apparently overlooking fresco, a technique for which it is unsuitable. Quite possibly English painters were not particularly concerned with fresco, but Dayes mentions that Prussian blue is liable to be destroyed by alkali and that its colour is extracted by lime. Although no very early references to the uses of the oil colour in England have been found, it appears to have been well established by the middle of the eighteenth century, and painters in oils were well satisfied with the colour. Bardwell states that it ‘is a very fine Blue and a kind working Colour’, adding only the reservation that it should not be used alone in painting flesh. Nevertheless, he does not give is such high praise as ultramarine, and it was not until the second half of the eighteenth century that Prussian blue came to be the most important oil colour blue, as in Williams’ <hi rend="i">Mechanic of Oil Colours</hi> where it is the only blue mentioned. The colour was reasonably priced, so amateurs used it as well as professionals, although not always without difficulty. It was probably no coincidence that a writer chose Prussian blue, a strongly staining colour, as an example in describing the difficulties to which self-taught amateurs were prone: ‘ . . . a bladder of Prussian blue bursts over one’s arm, and paints one’s fingers and clothes.’<hi rend="s">106</hi><lb/><lb/>
In water-colour painting Prussian blue was held in distrust for a considerable time. It appears somewhat as an afterthought in Smith’s <hi rend="i">Method of Painting in Water Colours</hi>, where ultramarine is recommended for the best painting, otherwise smalt ‘or Prussian-Blue will do as well’. In <hi rend="i">The Art of Drawing</hi>, 1731, the colour is said to be difficult to use because of its oily quality. Water colours were kept in shells ready for use, and it appears that whenever a wet pencil was applied to Prussian blue in the shell the colour went yellow where the water ran round the edge, suggesting therefore that the pigment was poorly manufactured at that time. Naturally, the presence of yellow was unwelcome because it accentuated the tendency towards green which is a natural characteristic of Prussian blue. By the end of the eighteenth century its manufacture must have improved, because Payne states that it is a good colour for miniature painting and that no other blue can equal its strength and transparency. Even so, there were many complaints that it did not flow freely and some writers, including Field, cast doubts on its permanence.

            <p>I hope that this, rather lengthy, quotation will clear things up a bit. [Over the years, I, myself an amateur given to pointing my brush (or <hi rend="i">pencil</hi> as it would have been called in the 18th Century), with my tongue and lips, must have ingested a monstrous amount of Prussian Blue without real hurt.]</p>
            <p>My immediate feeling, not having access to the translation of Scheele’s <hi rend="i">Essays</hi> by Thomas Beddoes (father of the author of <hi rend="i">Death’s Jest Book</hi>, is that there is a general chemical mix-up which has led Robert M. Ryan astray, and that the sorting of matters requires further reference to Scheele’s essays in German and in the modern translation by L. Dobbin, London, 1931, as well as the <hi rend="i">Encyclopédie</hi>, in French. It should be mentioned that the Swedish Scheele, investigating the properties of arsenic, did discover a green, later to be refined as Emerald Green, of copper arsenite. This discovery was made in 1775, but its composition is "made known because, as Scheele explained in 1777 in a letter to another scientist, he felt that potential users should be
<pb id="p14-34" n="34"/>
warned of its highly poisonous nature, and, in addition, he wished to prevent anyone else claiming credit for the discovery," Harley, pp. 75-76. Ralph Mayer, whose <hi rend="i">The Artist’s Handbook</hi>, Third Edition, The Viking Press, New York, 1970, is invaluable in many ways, is slightly untrustworthy on the history of pigments, during the period with which we are concerned, as are the authors of another necessary book, Rutherford J. Gettens &amp; George L. Stout, <hi rend="i">Painting Materials A Short Encyclopaedia</hi>, Dover, New York, 1966, but both mention the more widespread use of copper acetoarsenite, Emerald Green, probably first produced commercially in Schweinfurt in 1914, as a popular insecticide, Paris Green, which was in use, to my personal knowledge, into the 1940s, and it still retains an important place in von Oettingen, <hi rend="i">op. cit.</hi>, p. 242, as well as, still a pigment, in the newspapers recording the misfortunes of children eating the flaking paint in old houses.</p>
            <p>One thing that is certain is that Prussian Blue has nothing whatever to do with the Zyklon-B used at Auschwitz or the cyanide-tablets formerly employed in certain American states. There is no possible excuse for giving a good color a bad name, Junkers, Berlin, Prussian, and condemning it with no trial or reason, as Robert M. Ryan has done in <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi>, 7 (Spring 1974), 87-89. [If I can digress for a moment, I would like to say that whenever I have a brilliant idea, I note it down and then spend a week or two in playing the Devil’s Advocate and trying to tear it to pieces. If it stands up to my vicious attacks, I assume that, even if I am wrong, it is worth exposing to the blasts of my peers. A plenitude of references <hi rend="i">is</hi> too persuasive, and, even though the theory is false, can lead others astray.]</p>
            <p>Now, having stated my tentative idea that the "poisonous blue" was merely the nitric acid with which Blake bit his copperplates, and having done my best, thanks to Dr. Harley, to show the innocence of Prussian Blue, I feel that I should list the various blues, with some note of their toxicity, which were available to William Blake. In doing this I draw not only upon Dr. Harley’s book but also upon personal correspondence with her. I should remark here that Woad is kept for a third section of these notes. It had a more symbolical than actual pigmentary meaning by the end of the 18th Century.</p>

          <p>William Blake’s five hundred thirty-seven watercolor drawings and forty-three folio engravings for the edition of Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> which Richard Edwards published in 1797 were the largest commercial undertaking on which he ever engaged, but surprisingly little is known of it. No review has ever been discovered, only one periodical announcement is known,<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> and the publisher evidently went out of business within a year or so of its publication. Any light in this obscurity is welcome. <note id="n1"><hi rend="s">1</hi><hi rend="i"> The Monthly Epitome and Catalogue of New Publications</hi>, I (Jan 1797), 79: "<hi rend="i">Young’s Night Thoughts</hi>, with Etchings and Engravings, in Four Parts, Atlas sized 4to. to Subscribers 51.5s. to Nonsubscribers 61.6s. (Part I. in a few days.) <hi rend="i">Edwards, Bond-street.</hi>" It cannot have been published before June, for some plates are dated 1 June 1979. Notice that Blake is not named.
                            <p>The integral "Advertisement" to the book is dated 22 December 1976. If the notice in <hi rend="i">The Monthly Epitome</hi> is to be trusted, the letterpress was probably printed not long thereafter. The letterpress text may therefore have been finished six months before the last of the plates.</p></note></p>
          <p>The work is generally known today in two illustrated States:
<list type="ordered"><item><p><label>1)</label> With the forty-three engravings uncolored—though in a few copies (such as that in Bodley) one or a few of the plates may have been accidentally omitted from the text-pages on which they were supposed to be printed—these uncolored copies are not uncommon;</p></item><item><p><label>2)</label> With the engravings colored, at least some of them by Blake and his wife—some twenty-one copies of these are traced in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (1977), 642-646, 956-957.</p><p>A new unillustrated State of the work has recently been noticed:</p></item><item><p><label>3)</label> Without any of the normally integral engravings.</p></item></list></p>
          <p>Note that the engravings were normally printed on the same leaves as the text, surrounding the text. Consequently there is no question of the unillustrated copy having been separated from its illustrations during its subsequent history. The engravings were never present at all. And fairly clearly this was an original mode of issue, though no other copy in this unillustrated State has yet been traced.</p>
          <p>The unillustrated copy may be described as follows:
<q>
BINDING: Bound in original pale green (card)boards, now much faded, covered with green paper in the same shade, with a leather lable on the spine reading "YOUNG’S / NIGHTS." There is no clear ownership mark or date in it, but a modern printed slip inserted reads "3530 / 994"<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref>; the recto of the first flyleaf reads "[2.298 <hi rend="i">del</hi>] 2. 323" (presumably a shelf-mark); the top left and bottom right corners of the inner front board read in pencil "J / E" (?for James Edwards, Richard’s brother); the bottom right corner of the back inner board has, upsidedown, "5/-" and, right side up, "9 / 70 / eoo" (presumably a code for the price at which a dealer bought it in September 1970). The first and last free flyleaves are watermarked 1794 / J Whatman and are conjugate with the front and back paste-downs, indicating that they were probably bound about the time the work was printed, since the binding uses the same paper for fly-leaves and paste-downs as is used in the text.
<pb id="p14-35" n="35"/>
HISTORY: Sold by Maggs Bros. in 1979 to G. E. B.<lb/><lb/>
SIZE: 32.5 × 41.6 cm. (the uncut size is 33.0 × 42.2 cm.); edges trimmed but not gilt.<lb/><lb/>
WATERMARKS: 1794 / J Whatman vertically at the outer margin (where it would be in a quarto) on the first and last free fly-leaves (there is only one at each end) plus pp. [i-ii], 5-6, 9-10, 15-16, 23-24, 33-34, 35-36, 39-40, 47-48, 53-54, 59-60, 61-62, 71-72, 75-76, 83-84, 93-94. This gives a pattern of watermarks impossible in a quarto but possible in a folio using half-sheets. In the following list, italic numbers have the watermark:<lb/><lb/><table rows="4" cols="7"><row><cell><hi rend="i">i</hi>-iv</cell><cell/><cell/><cell><hi rend="i">5</hi>-8</cell><cell><hi rend="i">9</hi>-12</cell><cell>13-<hi rend="i">16</hi></cell><cell/></row><row><cell><hi rend="i">23</hi>-26</cell><cell/><cell><hi rend="i">31</hi>-34</cell><cell><hi rend="i">35</hi>-38</cell><cell><hi rend="i">39</hi>-42</cell><cell><hi rend="i">45</hi>-48</cell><cell/></row><row><cell><hi rend="i">53</hi>-56</cell><cell><hi rend="i">57</hi>-60</cell><cell><hi rend="i">61</hi>-64</cell><cell/><cell><hi rend="i">71</hi>-74</cell><cell><hi rend="i">75</hi>-78</cell><cell/></row><row><cell><hi rend="i">83</hi>-86</cell><cell/><cell><hi rend="i">91</hi>-94</cell><cell><hi rend="i">95</hi>-96</cell><cell/><cell/><cell/></row></table><hi rend="i">N.B.</hi> In the unillustrated copy there are many more leaves with watermarks (16) than in my illustrated copy (7): pp. 29-30, 43-44, 51-52, 55-56, 59-60, 79-80, 89-90: in the former, two-thirds of the half-sheets are watermarked, in the latter one-third.
</q><note id="n2"><hi rend="s">2</hi> I cannot identify this symbol.</note></p>
          <p>Because the sheets are unsigned and the work was ordinarily taken apart after the text was printed in order to print the illustrations on the same leaves, it has always been difficult to ascertain the format of the book. The present evidence indicates fairly clearly that it was printed as a folio on half-sheets.<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref><note id="n3"><hi rend="s">3</hi> Roger R. Easson &amp; Robert N. Essick, <hi rend="i">William Blake: Book Illustrator:</hi> A Bibliography and Catalogue of the Commercial Engravings, I (1972), 13, argue that the work was imposed as a quarto on whole sheets ("the absence of conjugacy can only be explained by the necessity of imposing the plates on quarter-sheets"), whereas the new evidence indicates that it was imposed as a folio on half-sheets.</note></p>
          <p>In the illustrated State of the work, all the engravings are printed on text-leaves except the titlepages for each of the four Nights. These titlepages have no letterpress text at all, their versos are blank, and they would therefore have appeared as entirely blank leaves in the unillustrated State. The unillustrated State has the same letterpress text on the same paper as in the illustrated State, with the following exceptions:
<table rows="6" cols="2"><row><cell><hi rend="i">State with Plates</hi></cell><cell><hi rend="i">State without Plates</hi></cell></row><row><cell>has pp. [ix—x] with titlepage for <hi rend="i">Night the First</hi></cell><cell>lacks pp. [ix-x]</cell></row><row><cell>has pp. [17-18] with titlepage for <hi rend="i">Night the Second</hi></cell><cell>lacks pp. [17-18]</cell></row><row><cell>has pp. [43-44] with titlepage for <hi rend="i">NIGHT THE THIRD</hi></cell><cell>lacks pp. [43-44]</cell></row><row><cell>has pp. [65-66] with frontispiece for Night IV</cell><cell>lacks pp. [65-66]</cell></row><row><cell>has the leaf of Explanation of the Engravings</cell><cell>lacks Explanation</cell></row></table></p>
          <p>Fairly clearly, the half-sheets of text of this unillustrated copy were not sent with the others to have the engravings added, presumably by Blake at his own press.</p>
          <p>Note incidentally that no attempt was made to accommodate the text to the space left for it in the engravings, or vice versa, for pp. 16, 63, and 95 at the ends of Nights I, III, and IV have text which ends well short of the space left for it in the designs.</p>
          <p>It is possible that this unillustrated State of the 1797 <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> is not rare, as Maggs Brothers and other dealers have claimed. On the other hand, neither I nor Sir Geoffrey Keynes, Professor Robert N. Essick, D. V. Erdman, and John E. Grant have any evidence about other copies of this unillustrated State, and it is at least possible that this copy of it is unique. The "J / E" on the boards may suggest that it belonged to Richard Edwards’ brother James, who was a book-seller and book-collector of some importance, though it did not appear in the sales of his library by Christie on 25-28 April 1804 and by Evans on 5-8, 10-11 April 1815.</p>
          <p>As is the case with most Blake discoveries, this raises as many questions as it answers. If this copy of the unillustrated State is unique, was it printed for Richard Edwards, or was it an accident? If there are other such copies, were they part of a commercial issue? If so, the book might have been issued by pre-arrangement in three States:
<list type="ordered"><item><p><label>1)</label> Unillustrated, for the benefit of Richard Edwards, who had paid the paper and letterpress printing expenses;</p></item><item><p><label>2)</label> Illustrated but uncolored, for the joint benefit of Richard Edwards and William Blake;</p></item><item><p><label>3)</label> Illustrated and colored, for the benefit of Blake, who had apparently borne all but about £21 of the expenses of designs, engravings, and perhaps plate printing.</p></item></list></p>
          <p>At any rate, we have now one more fact about the edition of Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> which Richard Edwards published in 1797. Unfortunately it does not answer any question very clearly.</p>

          <p>In the long fourth chapter of his 1704 essay "The Grounds of Criticism," John Dennis draws a distinction between "Vulgar Passion" and "Enthusiastick Passion, or Enthusiasm." In delineating the latter he uses as an example our various perceptions of the sun: " . . . [T]he Sun mention’d in ordinary Conversation, gives the Idea of a round flat shining Body, of about two foot diameter. But the Sun occurring to us in Meditation, gives the Idea of a vast and glorious Body, and the top of all the visible Creation, and the brightest material Image of the Divinity."<ref target="n4" type="note">1</ref> In his famous conclusion to "A Vision of The Last Judgment," Blake echoes Dennis’ exemplary contrast both in his imagery and diction. Blake, however, is contrasting the world of Imagination, rather than Enthusiasm, and Generation: "What it will be Questioned When the Sun rises do you not see a round Disk of fire somewhat like a Guinea O no no I see an Innumerable company of the Heavenly host crying Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God Almighty . . . ."<ref target="n5" type="note">2</ref> In the original, ironically, Dennis, while acknowledging the aesthetic superiority of "Enthusiastick Passion," proceeds in most un-Blakean fashion to recommend to poets the mastery of eliciting "Vulgar Passion," since more readers are capable of experiencing it. <note id="n4"><hi rend="s">1</hi><hi rend="i"> The Critical Works of John Dennis</hi>, ed.

          <p>Although David Erdman claims that "Laughing Song" in <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> owes much to Anna Barbauld’s <hi rend="i">Hymns in Prose for Children</hi> (1781), and David Bindman has discovered a visual influence on Blake’s illumination for "Laughing Song," no specific literary source or influence has been proposed for Blake’s lyric.<ref target="n6" type="note">1</ref> Certain affinities in form and content suggest, however, that in literature for children Blake’s song does have a prototype—a short lyric entitled "How to Laugh," which appears in Newbery’s <hi rend="i">A Pretty Book for Children</hi> (1761) and <hi rend="i">A Collection of Pretty Poems</hi> (1770). <note id="n6"><hi rend="s">1</hi> See <hi rend="i">Blake: Prophet against Empire</hi> (Princeton, 1969), p. 124. In <hi rend="i">Blake as an Artist</hi> (Oxford, 1977), pp. 59-60, Bindman discusses the probable influence on Blake of Stothard’s illustration for "Drinking Song" in Joseph Ritson’s <hi rend="i">English Songs</hi> (1783). Blake executed engravings after Stothard for this book.</note></p>
          <p>John Newbery (1713-1767) wrote, printed, and published some of the best and most beautifully bound books produced for children during the eighteenth century. His collections of rhymes are relatively free of the repressive moral and religious indoctrination characteristic of the vast majority of books for children then in print. For this reason, he has been seen as a possible influence on Blake.<ref target="n7" type="note">2</ref> At the very least, Newbery’s work can be said to stand largely outside the implied criticism, in <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>, of traditional and contemporary literature for children. His rhyme "How to Laugh" seems a special case, however, in that it is Newbery’s only lyric to which Blake specifically alludes, and with which he apparently takes issue. <note id="n7"><hi rend="s">2</hi> Foster Damon, <hi rend="i">William Blake, his Philosophy and Symbols</hi> (New York, 1924), p. 42.</note></p>
          <p>The verbal and conceptual similarities between Blake’s "Laughing Song" and Newbery’s "How to Laugh" are striking. Newbery’s four-line rhyme concerns human laughter as an expression of Nature in relation to other of Nature’s modes of expression:
<q>
Nature a thousand Ways complains,<lb/>
A thousand Words express her Pains:<lb/>
But for her Laughter has but three.<lb/>
And very small ones, Ha, Ha, He.
</q>
Blake’s subject is the same, and he uses the same laughing sounds to conclude the last two of his three stansas.</p>
          <p>But Blake contradicts the assertion in Newbery’s rhyme that Nature has only "three words"—"and very small ones"—to express happiness, whereas her numerous other sounds complain and express pain. In Blake’s lyric, expressions of pain are altogether absent. And instead of personifying nature as a whole, Blake humanizes her various aspects. Parts of the landscape, together with birds, grasshoppers, and even the air, laugh independently though in harmony with man’s own preverbal "Ha, Ha, He":
<q>
When the green woods laugh, with the voice of joy<lb/>
And the dimpling stream runs laughing by,<lb/>
When the air does laugh with our merry wit,<lb/>
And the green hill laughs with the noise of it.<lb/><lb/>
When the meadows laugh with lively green<lb/>
And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene,<lb/>
When Mary and Susan and Emily,<lb/>
With their sweet round mouths sing Ha, Ha, He.<lb/><lb/>
When the painted birds laugh in the shade<lb/>
Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread<lb/>
Come live &amp; be merry and join with me,<lb/>
To sing the sweet chorus of Ha, Ha, He.<ref target="n8" type="note">3</ref><note id="n8"><hi rend="s">3</hi><hi rend="i"> The Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>, ed. David Erdman (New York, 1970), p. 11. The subsequent quotation from Blake is also from this edition.</note></q>
Joyful innocence is here shared equally by man and by nature in its broad diversity and particularity. This is not mere personification or pathetic fallacy, but a clarity of vision in which, as Blake later put it, "All Human Forms" are "identified even Tree. Metal Earth &amp; Stone" (<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Ch. 4, pl. 99:57).</p>
          <p>The whole of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> implies the metaphysical equality and communion of man, nature, and the divine. But there is more human expression on the part of nature in "Laughing Song" than in all the rest of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence.</hi><ref target="n9" type="note">4</ref> That makes "Laughing Song" a focal point in the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> for the
<pb id="p14-37" n="37"/>
visionary identification of "Human Forms" in nature. The poem is exceptional in this regard probably because it was conceived and written as an antithesis or corrective to Newbery’s "How to Laugh," which excludes nature from full and equal participation in human life. <note id="n9"><hi rend="s">4</hi> In "Night," the moon smiles, and a lion speaks. In "A Dream," an emmet and glow worm speak. In "Spring," birds delight—which may or may not be a humanization.</note></p>

Recently I asked my colleague John Beattie, whose office is next to mine and whose field is the administration of justice in England in the eighteenth century, whether the court documents reported in <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> were likely to be all that survived and whether they were there interpreted plausibly. After reflecting for an embarrassingly brief time, he replied in as friendly and helpful a way as possible, No, and No. More important, he explained the way trials of the time were recorded and preserved and lent me his copy of a directory of the Sussex Record offices. The most obvious point he made is that the court documents quoted in <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> are in the West Sussex Record Office in Chichester, while no reference is made to the East Sussex Record Office in Lewes, which preserves materials relating not only to East Sussex but to the County as a whole. I am sorry to say that it had never occurred to me that there might be <hi rend="i">another</hi> relevant Sussex Record Office. The tardiness of this note I can only attribute to John Beattie’s not telling me so earlier.</p>
          <p>I therefore wrote to Lewes and was sent very promptly by A. A. Dibben, County Records Officer of the East Sussex County Council, reproductions of four documents relating to Blake’s trial. Two of these are minor; the third and fourth are of major importance but are already quoted in their entirety in <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> from the transcripts of Herbert Jenkins, who had not indicated the locations of the originals. Using the information so generously provided by John Beattie and A. A. Dibben, the alterations to <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> should be as follows:
<q>
PAGE 127, for the last paragraph read:<lb/><lb/>
On the morning of Tuesday the 16th, Blake, the soldier named Scolfield, his accomplice John Cock, and their lieutenant, who was responsible for preferring the charge, entered into recognizances for their appearance at the Quarter Sessions: . . .<lb/><lb/>
PAGE 128, for the end of the top paragraph and the beginning of the next read:<lb/><lb/>
Blake misremembered Hayley’s recognizance as £100 rather than £50. <hi rend="i">N.B.</hi> No money changed hands.<lb/><lb/>
Scholfield and Cock had to enter recognizances for £50 each:<lb/><lb/>
No "bonds were taken" from them; they merely acknowledged that, if they didn’t appear at the Quarter Sessions, they <hi rend="i">would</hi> "be indebted to our Sovereign Lord the King" in the sums specified. No borrowing was necessary, no cash was needed.<lb/><lb/>
PAGE 131, fn 2: Omit<lb/><lb/>
The primary source is in the Sussex County Record Office . . . . The secondary document, which amplifies the primary one and which may be the transcript Blake’s lawyer applied for on December 25th 1803 (q.v.), was transcribed, from an original I have not traced, by Herbert Jenkins in a typescript (now in my possession) and printed in his ‘The Trial of William Blake for High Treason [<hi rend="i">i.e., Sedition and Assault</hi>],’ <hi rend="i">Nineteenth Century</hi>, 1xvii (1910), 853-5, and <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi>, London, 1925. The Jenkins transcript has a few words . . . Sussex County Record Office . . . Sussex County Record Office . . .

As I understand, the main document, the Indenture &amp;c., was inscribed on a parchment roll and annotated as the trial proceeds, e.g., "Trav<hi rend="s">d</hi>". The lesser documents such as recognizances were inscribed on paper and often wrapped in the parchment roll to preserve them. Sometimes the paper documents were separated from the parchment roll and even destroyed, but the main parchment document was normally preserved if anything was. However, in this case there seems to be no surviving roll, and the paper documents are widely dispersed.<lb/><lb/>
I ignore most differences in capitalization (the East Sussex document gives "ff" for "F"), punctuation, and size of writing. The substantive differences in the East Sussex document are as follows: PAGE 131, 1. 5 of the document adds after "(that is to say)": "SUSSEX, to wit"; PAGE 132, 1. 3 omits "said"; 1. 7 reads "said said"; 1. 13 reads "incite"; 1. 16 omits the dash; PAGE 133, 1. 17 "(to wit)" is within parentheses; PAGE 134, 11. 3-5 are omitted.
</q></p>
          <p>The Jenkins transcript was wrong in giving "would" for "could" on p. 132, 1. 30.
<q>
PAGE 134, 1. 11, for "<hi rend="i">raise</hi>" read "<hi rend="i">cause</hi>"; 1. 13, for 
    "<hi rend="i">Ackw. 100£</hi>" read "<hi rend="i">Acknd 100<hi rend="s">1</hi></hi>."; 
    1. 14, "<hi rend="i">William Hayley</hi>" should not be in capitals; 1. 15, for 
    "<hi rend="i">50£</hi>." read "<hi rend="i">50<hi rend="s">1</hi></hi>."; 1. 17, for 
    "<hi rend="i">Ackwd</hi>" read "<hi rend="i">Ackwd</hi>".

          <p>The East Sussex document continues:

          <p>This True Bill was also reported upon a printed form:</p>
          <p>Add at the bottom of the page:</p>
          <p>It should be noticed that the violence of these statements concerning Assault ("his Life was greatly despaired of") is in the printed part of the document and is merely a matter of form.</p>
          <pb id="p14-39" n="39"/>
          <p>If Blake had pleaded Guilty to the Indictment (a rare occurrence in 18th Century rural courts), the case would have been tried immediately. When the accused pleads Not Guilty, however, ‘the officer of the court asks the party whether he be ready to try then, or will traverse [put off the trial] to the next sessions’, as was normal. Blake clearly denied his guilt and chose to be tried for sedition and assault at the next Quarter Sessions in January 1804, so the Bill was marked ‘Trav<hi rend="s">d</hi>.’</p>
          <p>And in the summary of the proceedings in the Minute Book was recorded:
<table rows="2" cols="2"><row><cell>W<hi rend="s">m</hi>. Blakes Ind<hi rend="s">t</hi>. for Sedit<hi rend="s">n</hi>.<lb/>

          <p>Purged of redundancies, ‘said’ and ‘to wit’, what Blake was alleged to have said was:
<q>
The English know within themselves that Buonaparte could take possession of England in an hour’s time, and then it would be put to every Englishman’s choice for to either fight for the French or to have his throat cut. I think that I am as strong a man as most, and it shall be throat cut for throat cut, and the strongest man will be the conqueror. You will not fight against the French. Damn the King and Country and all his subjects. I have told this before to greater people than you. Damn the King and his Country; his subjects and all you soldiers are sold for slaves.<lb/><lb/>

PAGE 135, fn. 1 should read:<lb/><lb/>
These sums [<hi rend="i">£1,000</hi>] are absurdly exaggerated, for in Jan 1803 and Oct 1804 Blake’s recognizance was for £100, and those for Hayley and Seagrave, his two sureties, were for only £50.<lb/><lb/>

As a last formality, Hayley, Seagrave, and Blake were discharged from their recognizances, since they had appeared at the trials:<lb/><lb/>
