                <p>If crooked roads without improvement are the ways of genius, the road Blake took
                    to Canterbury was a veritable Pilgrim’s Progress.<ref target="n0" type="note">*</ref><note id="n0">This article is an expanded version of a paper
                        delivered in the symposium “William Blake: His Art and Times,” The Yale
                        Center for British Art, 11 September 1982.</note> For of all his works of
                    art, the one that cost him the most grief and stirred up the greatest
                    controversy during his lifetime was the large “fresco” painting of <hi rend="i">Sir Jeffery Chaucer and the Nine and Twenty Pilgrims on their Journey to
                        Canterbury.</hi> This painting, dated 1808, was the major work in Blake’s
                    1809 Exhibition and the first to be attacked in Robert Hunt’s scathing review in
                        <hi rend="i">The Examiner.</hi> It also caused a bitter falling-out between
                    Blake and his old friend Thomas Stothard, who in May 1807 had exhibited an
                    immensely successful oil painting of the same subject, similar in size and basic
                    design to Blake’s own. Blake’s engraving from his fresco, entitled <hi rend="i">Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims</hi>, was published in October 1810; the
                    engraving of Stothard’s painting was delayed, through a series of mishaps, till
                    1817. Stothard protested that Blake had “commenced his picture in rivalry” to
                    Stothard’s own, since, he reported, Blake had seen and admired his <hi rend="i">Procession of Chaucer’s Pilgrims to Canterbury</hi> while it was still in
                    progress. Blake on his side claimed that he had sketched the design for his <hi rend="i">Pilgrims</hi> even earlier and had shown the drawing to Robert
                    Cromek, his erstwhile agent, who, while appearing to be delighted with it, had
                    taken the idea to Stothard and engaged him to paint it instead.</p>
                <p>Such are the outlines of the controversy as described by Blake’s earliest
                    biographers, quite evenhandedly by John Thomas Smith in 1828 and, with obvious
                    bias against Blake, by Allan Cunningham in 1830.<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> But since the appearance of Alexander Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life
                        of William Blake</hi> in 1863, the controversy has been regarded as settled:
                    virtually every twentieth-century biographer or critic who has discussed the
                    matter has, despite minor uncertainties over points of fact, followed Gilchrist
                    in taking sides with Blake and accusing Cromek of treachery.<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> Yet it must be borne in mind that the story of Blake’s
                    life as hitherto received is based in very large part on Blake’s own testimony,
                    supported by a modicum of corroboratory evidence—that is, on Blake’s
                    recollections during his sixties which he passed on to the disciples who became
                    Gilchrist’s informants some three decades later. A fresh look at the evidence in
                    the dispute over <hi rend="i">The Canterbury Pilgrims</hi> may not merely
                    suggest a different interpretation of a central episode in Blake’s life but also
                    serve as example of the need for a critical re-examination of his life as a
                    whole. In the process the critic must scrutinize the minutest particulars of
                    fact, weigh conflicting testimony, and keep constantly in mind the ambiguity of
                    interpretation and the fallibility of memory. The remembrance of things past is
                    a voyage over shifting sands. <note id="n1"><hi rend="s">1</hi>As reprinted in

                <p>Gilchrist based his account largely on John Linnell’s notes on Smith’s memoir,
                    which he wrote in 1855 drawing on conversations with Blake over thirty years
                    earlier. According to Linnell, Cromek actually commissioned Blake to finish the
                    Canterbury fresco for twenty guineas with the promise that he would also receive
                    the much more lucrative fee for engraving it—the identical arrangement he had
                    made with Blake for his designs for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> two or three
                    months earlier. But, Linnell states, Cromek secretly negotiated with William
                    Bromley to engrave Blake’s design; meanwhile Blake became suspicious and refused
                    to give Cromek his drawing when requested; whereupon Cromek took the idea and
                    the commission to Stothard without informing either painter of the other’s
                    involvement. Gilchrist like Linnell clears Stothard of complicity in Cromek’s
                    scheme; he also quotes an insulting letter that Cromek wrote to Blake in May
                    1807 which contains the only known reference to the dispute by either of the two
                    principals. The letter consists mainly of Cromek’s abusive response to Blake’s
                    “furious rage” at the success of Stothard’s <hi rend="i">Procession</hi> (then
                    being exhibited in London) by challenging Blake “to send [him] a better”:
                    whereupon, Gilchrist adds, “the indignant painter acted in executing, hereafter,

                        184-87, 464n1. The letter was published by Allan Cunningham’s son in 1852
                            (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 187n2), and thereby prompted Gilchrist to cast
                        Cromek as the villain of the piece. Stothard’s painting was the sensation of
                        the 1807 season in London, drawing crowds of thousands at a shilling
                        admission, and subsequently toured the provinces with similar success. The
                        engraving, despite its delayed appearance, became the best-selling print of
                        the first half of the nineteenth century (Anna E. Bray, <hi rend="i">Life of
                            Thomas Stothard</hi> [London, 1851] 140).</note></p>
                <p>Gilchrist’s suggestion, that Blake painted, exhibited, and engraved his <hi rend="i">Pilgrims</hi> only after seeing Stothard’s painting and in response
                    to Cromek’s challenge in 1807, is curiously inconsistent with his earlier
                    statement (following Linnell) that Cromek first saw a sketch of the <hi rend="i">Pilgrims</hi> by Blake and then, after negotiations between them broke
                    down, went to Stothard and “suggested the subject as a novelty.” Indeed, the
                    precise chronology of the whole affair is a puzzle. If, as it is generally
                    assumed, Blake had begun work on his fresco (or even his engraving) sometime
                    late in 1805 or early in 1806,<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> his delay in
                    meeting the threat to his own project till 1808 is inexplicable: the subject had
                    never been painted before, and priority was an important concern. It is also
                    difficult to understand why Blake, on seeing Stothard’s half-finished painting
                    in 1806, would have failed to mention his own work in progress to his friend,
                    who was surprised and angered on learning later of Blake’s rival version.<ref target="n5" type="note">5</ref> Finally, it is striking that Cromek’s letter
                    of May 1807 nowhere mentions any drawing or painting of Chaucer’s <hi rend="i">Pilgrims</hi> by Blake, or replies to any charge by Blake of the theft of
                    his idea; rather it suggests that Blake’s rage was directed against the
                    extraordinary success of Stothard’s painting and what he felt was Stothard’s
                    contemptible treatment of the subject. The earliest accounts of the affair are
                    vague about dates and mutually contradictory on certain points, and it is hardly
                    surprising that recent discussions also give a confused picture of the entire
                        controversy.<ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref> A survey of the

                        ‘Canterbury Pilgrims’ ” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 13 (1980): 164-90 examines
                        in detail a number of analogues to Blake’s design in previous illustrations
                        of the <hi rend="i">Tales</hi>; but the single illustration she cites (172,
                        174-75) of the Pilgrims setting out on their journey, from Urry’s 1721
                        edition of Chaucer, barely qualifies as a source for Blake’s painting, even
                        though Blake may have known of this edition. Only 11 of the tiny figures in
                        the 7½″ × 3¾″ engraving are identifiable, much less individualized, and the
                        overall design and graphic style are completely different from Blake’s. The
                        figures of the Merchant and the Wife of Bath in the Chaucer portrait of the
                        “Heads of the Poets” (Butlin, vol. 2, pl. 440), which she cites as “faithful
                        copies” from Urry, are totally unlike their counterparts in the <hi rend="i">Pilgrims.</hi></note><note id="n6"><hi rend="s">6</hi> On Linnell and
                        Smith’s inaccuracies, see note 37 below. Butlin, citing Bentley (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 220), states that Stothard’s engraving appeared before
                        Blake’s “in about November 1809” (1: 475), while Anthony Blunt (<hi rend="i">The Art of William Blake</hi> [New York: Columbia UP, 1959] 77),
                        followed by Kathleen Raine (<hi rend="i">William Blake</hi> [New York:
                        Prager, 1970] 169), states that Cromek “published an engraving after
                        Stothard’s painting, with great profit to himself.” But only the preliminary
                        etching was completed by Schiavonetti in 1809, a few months before his
                        death, and the engraving did not appear till five years after Cromek’s death
                        in 1812.</note></p>
                <p>We should start by recalling the depressed state of the craft of engraving in the
                    1800’s as well as the low ebb of Blake’s fortunes at that time. Partly this was
                    a matter of economics—the decay of the crafts system in general, the low state
                    of the economy, the development of new techniques of reproduction, and the
                    collapse of the European market for English prints as a result of the war with
                    Napoleon. The bank crash of 1797, which had contributed to the failure of
                    Blake’s illustrated edition of <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, had also
                    bankrupted Boydell’s ambitious <hi rend="i">Shakespeare Gallery</hi>; the
                    imperilled state of engraving in England during the 1800’s led to the founding
                    of a short-lived Society for the Encouragement of the Art of Engraving by the
                    Chaleographic Society in 1810.<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref><pb id="p22-82" n="82"/> But Blake’s precarious circumstances around 1805—when
                    he was apparently living on a guinea a week<ref target="n8" type="note">8</ref>—must also be seen in terms of changing fashions in graphics. All during
                    his career English taste in printmaking had been shifting away from traditional
                    line engraving to the newer tonal processes of mezzotint, stipple, and aquatint.
                    For Blake, trained primarily in the linear tradition, pure line remained his
                    chosen medium; the “old Hard Stiff &amp; Dry” effects that his teachers at the
                    Royal Academy reproved him for admiring were the very qualities that turned
                    prospective buyers away from <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> and toward the
                    softer more painterly style of Bartolozzi and his disciples.<ref target="n9" type="note">9</ref> Contemporary critics found Blake’s engraving technique
                    “defective,” “completely inferior” to such rivals as Schiavonetti, and condemned
                    his designs as “deformity and extravagance.” Boydell, Macklin, and Bowyer had
                    passed him over in their ambitious publishing projects, and now even Hayley and
                    Flaxman were withdrawing their support.<ref target="n10" type="note">10</ref> By
                    the autumn of 1805, then, Blake seemed headed toward failure both as independent
                    designer and as commercial engraver. To gain any recognition from the public,
                    his work emphatically needed promotion. <note id="n7"><hi rend="s">7</hi> Dennis

                        disputed by Bentley: whose claim that Blake was “riding the crest of a wave
                        of prosperity” in the autumn of 1805 (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 173) must,
                        however, be questioned. He estimates Blake’s income for the first ten months
                        of 1805 at £98, or £2.3 a week (186n1). But apart from payments by Flaxman
                        and Butts totalling £37.18 (571-72) there is only a very doubtful commission
                        of 10 guineas from Joseph Thomas in September (166, 606 and G. E. Bentley,
                        Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> [Oxford: Clarendon, 1977], hereafter

                        guineas for the plates to the 1805 edition of the <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>
                        promised him by the publisher Phillips under a profit-sharing agreement.
                            (<hi rend="i">The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>, ed.
                        David V. Erdman [hereafter cited as E] 762-65). To prove this was actually
                        paid Bentley cites a letter of 25 April 1805 (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 161,
                        186n1—actually by Phillips not Blake), but the payment is not mentioned in
                        the letter as quoted (161-62). Blake’s letters from June to December 1805 (E
                        765-67) indicate he was in constant want of cash and had heard nothing from
                        Phillips since the <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> were published in June: the
                        1805 venture was apparently as much of a financial loss as the 1802 <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> had been (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 116-17). His final
                        word on the subject is the epigram on Phillips: “He loved me and for no Gain
                        at all / But to rejoice &amp; triumph in my fall” (E 505). It seems, then,
                        that Blake’s income for the ten months leading up to Cromek’s offer was
                        probably not much over £40. From Bentley’s figures for the following year
                            (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 574-75, 606, 617), his income for 1806 came to
                        about £55. Blake’s increasing poverty was an important factor in his state
                        of mind in 1807 and afterward.</note><note id="n9"><hi rend="s">9</hi> On

                <p>This is the point at which Robert Hartley Cromek entered the scene. A book
                    collector and moderately successful engraver, Cromek had studied under
                    Bartolozzi at the same time as Schiavonetti; he was a good friend of the
                    Flaxmans and George Cumberland and probably acquainted for some years with both
                    Blake and Stothard. Though his work had won high praise from Flaxman, Cromek
                    decided about this time to give up engraving for the more active life of
                    print-publisher and dealer.<ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref> With little
                    capital behind him, he conceived of a large illustrated edition of Robert
                    Blair’s popular if lugubrious poem <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> as his first
                    project, and he showed a courageous taste in choosing Blake in September 1805 to
                    do the designs. In a letter to Hayley of 27 November 1805 enclosing a copy of a
                    Prospectus for the volume, Blake spoke warmly of his friend Cromek’s
                    “liberality” in commissioning a set of drawings (for a fee of twenty guineas)
                    and of his “Spirited Exertions” in securing the recommendations of thirteen
                    Royal Academicians for the work—the high-water mark of recognition by the
                    Academy that he was to receive in his lifetime. Blake added that Cromek was so
                    pleased with the twenty designs he selected “that he with the same liberality
                    with which he set me about the drawings, has now set me to Engrave them.”<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> However, in a second Prospectus almost
                    identical with the first and like it dated November 1805, the number of plates
                    was reduced to twelve and the name of Schiavonetti substituted for Blake’s as
                    the engraver. This action by Cromek has repeatedly been described as a betrayal
                    of Blake, on the assumption that Cromek had arbitrarily transferred the
                    commission to Schiavonetti and perfidiously issued the second Prospectus without
                    informing Blake of his decision, neither of which seems to be the case. The
                    November 1805 date of the second Prospectus, on which the charge of Cromek’s
                    perfidy rests, now appears to be incorrect; it was evidently issued a month or
                    two later, and there is no reason to think that Cromek concealed his decision
                    from Blake till after it was printed.<ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref> The
                    decision itself was his reaction to Blake’s first engraving for <hi rend="i">The
                        Grave</hi>, his design for “Death’s Door”—his first plate etched completely
                    in white line, a revolutionary inversion of traditional technique. The potential
                    subscribers who viewed the proofs at Cromek’s place of business were evidently
                    nonplussed or worse; and Cromek, realizing that Blake’s bold ruggedness of
                    treatment would doom the book to failure, hastily turned to Schiavonetti to
                    engrave the designs instead—a move that was within his rights as the originator
                    and financer of the project.<ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref> This is not
                    to deny Blake’s disappointment and humiliation, or to accept the popular
                    preference for Schiavonetti’s style over Blake’s, or to recast the “Fiends of
                    Commerce” as the heroes of the piece: only to remind ourselves that—as J. T.
                    Smith drily remarked—“it would be unreasonable to expect the booksellers to
                    embark in publications not likely to meet remuneration.”<ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref><note id="n11"><hi rend="s">11</hi> On Cromek’s

                        of the agreement, Blake’s letter implies that in September 1805 Cromek
                        merely commissioned “a set of drawings,” and that the engraving was not
                        agreed on till November. On the other hand, a letter by Flaxman to Hayley of
                        18 October 1805 (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 166-67) reports that Cromek had
                        proposed that Blake engrave 20 of his original 40 drawings, but it is not
                        clear whether Flaxman had this information from Cromek or from Blake.
                        Cromek’s fee of a guinea for each finished drawing is what Blake was
                        receiving from Butts for his tempera frescoes at this time.</note><note id="n13"><hi rend="s">13</hi> See <hi rend="i">BR</hi> 168-71 for the second

                        “Blake and Cromek: The Wheat and the Tares” <hi rend="i">Modern
                            Philology</hi> 71 (1974): 367-69. This discovery, along with a letter by
                        Cromek to James Montgomery of April 1807 speaking warmly of Blake (372-75),
                        considerably softened Bentley’s earlier criticism of Cromek (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 168-71 <hi rend="i">et passim</hi>). Butlin, who like Bentley
                        notes that the type of the second prospectus was only partly reset (in fact
                        only three lines were altered and three added), suggests (1: 454) that it
                        was issued some time after Blake’s letter to Hayley of 11 December 1805,
                        which thanked him for his “kind Reception” of the “New Projected Work” and
                        said nothing of the commission being given to Schiavonetti (E 766-67). Since
                        the first proof of Schiavonetti’s first etching (also of “Death’s Door”) was
                        dated 12 February 1806, it appears that Schiavonetti was appointed and the

                        the blackening of Cromek’s character, admits that the change was “a happy
                        choice of engravers on Cromek’s part; . . . indeed, Schiavonetti’s
                        engravings introduced Blake’s designs to a wider public than himself could
                        ever have done” (<hi rend="i">Life</hi> 219). Todd 84 suggests that in
                        refusing to work in a more acceptable style Blake “may have been more
                        blameworthy than has usually been admitted.”</note></p>
                <p>However, Cromek has been depicted as an unscrupulous publisher, a “printjobber”
                    who “jockeyed Blake out of his copyright” and made windfall profits on the
                    venture. But Blake would not have retained the copyright even if he had done the
                    engravings for <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>: as with his arrangement in 1796 with
                    Richard Edwards for <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, once he sold his designs
                    the copyright passed automatically to the purchaser, who assumed the costs of
                    publication (including the engraving) in the hope of making a profit.<ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref> Edwards, incidentally, paid Blake a mere
                    twenty guineas—or 9 ½d. each—for his 537 folio-size watercolor designs for <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, though probably five pounds (Blake’s usual
                    fee) for each of his forty-three engravings.<ref target="n17" type="note">17</ref> By May 1807, it is true, Cromek’s twenty-guinea fee for the twenty
                    designs to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> no longer seemed liberal to Blake, who
                    had evidently heard that Cromek had paid Stothard a hundred guineas for his
                    Chaucer painting and was making huge profits on the exhibition: hence his angry
                    demand of four guineas for the dedication page which elicited Cromek’s angry
                    reply. But Cromek’s <pb id="p22-83" n="83"/> profits on <hi rend="i">The
                        Grave</hi> have been vastly exaggerated, from Kathleen Raine’s figure of
                    “about £1800” down to Bentley’s more cautious estimate of £900.<ref target="n18" type="note">18</ref> Even this latter figure needs correcting. First, it
                    underestimates Cromek’s fee to Schiavonetti by almost £300; second, it computes
                    the sales figures in terms of the postpublication price of two and a half
                    guineas instead of the subscription price of two guineas; and third, it does not
                    take into account Cromek’s travel expenses for over two years throughout England
                    and Scotland, drumming up subscriptions and then delivering the finished books,
                    which he had packed himself.<ref target="n19" type="note">19</ref> A revised

                    And Cromek’s “Spirited Exertions” did not cease after securing the
                    recommendations of the Academicians. He persuaded Fuseli to write a glowing
                    endorsement of Blake’s designs, exhibited the drawings in London and the
                    provinces, found subscribers for almost 700 copies, advertised the book
                    repeatedly, and finally arranged for the volume to be dedicated to the

                        “Advertisements” 73-75. To these efforts should be added Cromek’s persuading
                        Malkin to include an encomium of Blake’s art and poetry and a puff for <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> in the preface to his <hi rend="i">Father’s

                        Schiavonetti) for a frontispiece to the volume. And in 1807 and 1808 Cromek,
                        professing admiration of his “Noble though extravagant Flights” (“Blake and
                        Cromek” 372), was apparently trying to find buyers for some of Blake’s
                        earlier books (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 191 and n1). However, as Essick and
                        Paley point out, all Cromek’s “bustling and puffing” could not produce
                        favorable reviews of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>: only one mildly positive

                <p>With this first episode of the Blake-Cromek relationship in mind we may turn back
                    to the quarrel over the <hi rend="i">Canterbury Pilgrims</hi> project. The first
                    point at issue is whether the idea for the painting originated with Blake or
                    with Cromek. Both Smith and Linnell state that it was Blake’s: but this
                    ascription is unlikely, even though it has been almost universally accepted. In
                    the first place, both Smith and Linnell erroneously credit Blake with the
                    original idea for the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> designs, and they may be in
                    similar error about the Chaucer project. More important, it was Blake’s habit as
                    an engraver to work on “tasks happily prescribed by others,” as Gilchrist put
                    it, especially with ambitious undertakings such as <hi rend="i">Night
                        Thoughts</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Grave.</hi> Living largely on publishers’
                    advances, continually short of cash, Blake simply could not afford to embark on
                    a long-term independent project in 1805; in fact, with the exception of his
                    illustrations to Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>, he had not published any
                    engravings of his own design for over ten years.<ref target="n22" type="note">22</ref> Furthermore, it is striking that Blake never evinced an interest
                    in Chaucer prior to his 1808 painting and his 1809 <hi rend="i">Descriptive
                        Catalogue.</hi> Only one reference to Chaucer occurs in all his poetry, on
                    the next-to-last page of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (98:9), and his discussion
                    of Chaucer’s universality in the <hi rend="i">Catalogue</hi> is heavily indebted
                    to Dryden’s comments in his preface to the <hi rend="i">Fables.</hi><ref target="n23" type="note">23</ref> Indeed, from all we know of Blake’s
                    preoccupations in 1805, a painting of Chaucer’s Pilgrims seems one of the least
                    likely projects he could have undertaken. In the absence of any expressed
                    concern with Chaucer by Blake before 1808, there seems no reason, then, to doubt
                    Cromek’s word when he congratulated himself “for thinking of such a glorious
                    Subject” in a letter to James Montgomery of April 1807.<ref target="n24" type="note">24</ref> Cromek’s own interest in Chaucer—like that of many
                    other readers including Coleridge—may have been kindled by William Godwin’s
                    popular biography of 1803, the first attempt at a full-length life. His account
                    of picking up a copy of the <hi rend="i">Tales</hi> in Halifax in the summer of
                    1806 while waiting for the London coach and conceiving of the idea for a
                    painting of the Pilgrims which he then took to Stothard, is at least as
                    circumstantial as Blake’s story preserved by Smith and Linnell.<ref target="n25" type="note">25</ref><note id="n22"><hi rend="s">22</hi> See <hi rend="i">Life</hi> 95. Excepting the illuminated books and <hi rend="i">The

                        engraved by Blake during his lifetime were done on his own initiative, not

                        financial reward proportionate to his investment of time: presumably they
                        would have occupied all the attention he had left for unremunerative
                        work.</note><note id="n23"><hi rend="s">23</hi> This single reference to

                        Chaucer engraving contrasts significantly with Blake’s frequent mention of
                        other poets: Milton (61, excluding references in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>),
                        Shakespeare (20), Dryden (10), Chatterton (7), Spenser (6), Pope (5), and

                        Chaucer from his earliest years (see e.g., Michael Phillips “Blake and the
                        ‘Unincreasable Club’ ” <hi rend="i">Bulletin of the New York Public

                        Phillips nor Gleckner in their studies of Blake’s early poetry demonstrates
                        any Chaucerian influence; and Karl Kiralis, noting his erratic
                        transcriptions in the <hi rend="i">Catalogue</hi>, questions his later

                            Children: The Gates of Paradise</hi> Blake attributed it to Dryden

                        ed. David V. Erdman [Oxford: Clarendon, 1973] N69). Though Chaucer was
                        included among the “Heads of the Poets” which he painted for Hayley’s
                        library, these portraits clearly reflect Hayley’s choice rather than Blake’s
                        own (Butlin 1: 297; Bindman 133-34). On his debt to Dryden see S. Foster

                        minutely detailed description of the social-historical background for which
                        Godwin’s work was generally praised (Spurgeon 2: 9-19, 31-37) is the same
                        “antiquarian exactness” for which Stothard’s painting was acclaimed (see the
                        “Prospectus” for the engraving of Stothard’s <hi rend="i">Procession</hi> in
                        Blair <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> [London: 1808] [38]—to which Blake’s
                        rather Johnsonian praise of Chaucer’s universality was diametrically
                        opposed.</note></p>
                <p>The second question in dispute is whether, as Blake asserted to Linnell, Cromek
                    actually commissioned him to design the <hi rend="i">Canterbury Pilgrims</hi>,
                    with the promise of the engraving fee to follow. The issue is largely academic
                    since, if the idea was Cromek’s to begin with, he would have been within his
                    rights to take the subject to Stothard if, after first proposing it to Blake, he
                    had been dissatisfied with Blake’s initial treatment of it—as indeed he would
                    have been bewildered by the consciously archaic style Blake adopted for his
                    design. However, it is significant that J. T. Smith, whose record of the affair
                    in 1828 was based on first-hand discussion with a number of Blake’s friends,
                    made no reference to a commission; it was Allan Cunningham who first mentioned
                    it two years later, simply to record Cromek’s denial that he had ever given
                        one.<ref target="n26" type="note">26</ref> A third question is whether Blake
                    in fact made a pencil sketch of the subject in 1805 or early 1806, which would
                    bolster though not clinch his claim that Cromek stole his idea. No drawing that
                    can be so dated survives, though Gilchrist recounts a curious story concerning
                        <figure n="CanterburyPilgrimsDetail.22.3.bqscan" rend="file"/><pb id="p22-84" n="84"/> such a sketch. Blake, as he tells it, hung his original
                    design for the <hi rend="i">Pilgrims</hi> on his sitting room wall for perhaps a
                    year before the appearance of Stothard’s <hi rend="i">Procession</hi> in 1807;
                    then on taking it down to use for his own fresco “he found it nearly effaced:
                    the result of some malignant spell of Stothard’s,” as he insisted later to
                    Flaxman, who naturally pooh-poohed the suggestion.<ref target="n27" type="note">27</ref> Since neither Smith nor Linnell mentioned this incident in his
                    account of the affair, it may be another piece of the Blake apocrypha; but even
                    if Blake made the charge to Flaxman, the story itself does not prove that an
                    1805 sketch ever existed. Yet interestingly enough, a drawing of the Pilgrims
                    does survive whose appearance clearly indicates that it was hung on the wall as
                    Gilchrist describes. This is the drawing of 1809 or 1810, soiled and faded and
                    showing tack marks at top and bottom, which Blake made to reduce the design of
                    his painting to the dimensions of his plate for engraving.<ref target="n28" type="note">28</ref> So Gilchrist’s story may recall an actual conversation,
                    though it is misleadingly vague as to the date. Either the exchange took place,
                    as Gilchrist suggests, in 1807 or 1808, and Blake invoked Stothard’s “malignant
                    spell” to explain to Flaxman the absence of an earlier sketch of the subject
                    that would prove his priority; or possibly the incident occurred some years
                    later, when Blake could have pointed to the 1809-10 drawing as the “original
                    design” from which Stothard had stolen his theme. In either event, the drawing
                    remained as concrete evidence for Linnell or another informant to later convince
                    Gilchrist of the truth of Blake’s version of the case. One more point at issue,
                    Crabb Robinson’s vague recollection in 1852 of hearing some thirty years earlier
                    of a prospectus for Blake’s engraving circulated in 1806, proves a red herring
                    on close inspection.<ref target="n29" type="note">29</ref><note id="n26"><hi rend="s">26</hi><hi rend="i"> BR</hi> 464-65, 491. While Cunningham’s
                        memoir of Blake is unreliable in a number of details, it is likely to be
                        accurate in his account of Cromek, whom he knew well from his mildly

                        241. Wilson insists (235) that Blake was jesting when he made this remark,
                        if indeed he did: but it is in keeping with other wild accusations Blake
                        made during these years (see note 46 below).</note><note id="n28"><hi rend="s">28</hi> Butlin 1 no. 654, 2 pl. 880. The verso is inscribed by
                        Tatham, who inherited the drawing from Catherine Blake, “The Original

                        size of the Plate Blake afterwards engraved.” Linnell, who probably relayed
                        the story to Gilchrist, was evidently aware of the drawing’s existence but
                        not of its date: perhaps because Tatham wrote his note shortly before
                        offering it for sale in 1862 or, as Morton Paley has suggested in
                        correspondence, because Linnell, whose relations with Tatham were strained,
                        was given no opportunity to examine it.</note><note id="n29"><hi rend="s">29</hi><hi rend="i"> BR</hi> 538, 179 and n3.</note></p>
                <p>Beyond the unlikelihood of Blake’s conceiving of the <hi rend="i">Canterbury
                        Pilgrims</hi> in 1805, however, there are more positive reasons for linking
                    the project to 1808, the date recorded on the painting. The first is Blake’s
                    probable motive in undertaking the Chaucer painting at this time. Nothing in
                    Blake’s art of 1805—predominantly Biblical themes in a recreation of his earlier
                    neoclassic manner—provides a context for the Gothic style and realistic subject
                    matter of the <hi rend="i">Pilgrims.</hi> But in 1807, his simmering resentment
                    against Cromek and Schiavonetti over the Blair project, the success of
                    Stothard’s painting (which Schiavonetti had now been appointed to engrave), and
                    Cromek’s insolent challenge to “send me a better” evidently roused Blake to
                    indignant protest, not only against Stothard’s treatment of the subject but also
                    against the whole system that produced it. For the <figure n="CanterburyProcessionDetail.22.3.bqscan" rend="file"/><hi rend="i">Pilgrims</hi> is not simply the most consciously archaic of all Blake’s
                    works: its archaism is not merely a style but a statement. The unholy alliance
                    of publisher, painter, and engraver—Cromek, Stothard, and Schiavonetti—was to
                    Blake the cause of the corruption of art in his time, in which increasingly the
                    conception of a design was isolated from both its execution and, at one more
                    remove, its reproduction, and the role of the artist increasingly subordinated
                    to that of the entrepreneur. This system of production, which Morris Eaves has
                    aptly named “the artistic machine,” Blake saw reflected in the “broken lines”
                    and mechanical techniques of Schiavonetti’s stipple and mezzotint, to which
                    Blake scornfully contrasted the integrity of his own linear style, the unbroken
                    line which is the test of true artistry. As he wrote years later, “A Line is a
                    Line in its Minutest Subdivision[s] Strait or Crooked It is Itself &amp; Not
                    Intermeasurable with or by any Thing Else” (E 783). Thus his choice of the style
                    he had learned from “Alb. Durer and the old Engravers” (E 572) was not a simple
                    quest of historical accuracy, like the “antiquarian exactness” of Stothard’s
                    painting based on patient research in the British Museum; more significantly it
                    was a return to the spirit of his uncorrupted youth, the Gothic world of
                    Westminster Abbey and the medieval master craftsmen. Integrity of style was to
                    be matched by integrity of production: Blake conceived his own vision of the <hi rend="i">Pilgrims</hi>, painted it, exhibited it, engraved it, advertised
                    and sold it all on his own. “If a man is master of his profession,” he wrote at
                    the end of the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>, “and if he is not
                    employed by <pb id="p22-85" n="85"/><figure n="CanterburyCrowdDetail.22.3.bqscan" rend="file"/> those who pretend to
                    encourage art, he will employ himself and laugh in secret at the pretences of
                    the ignorant”—thus gaining “a reward for the labours of the day, such as the
                    world cannot give” (E 550). The <hi rend="i">Canterbury Pilgrims</hi> must be
                    read as Blake’s answer to Schiavonetti’s facile virtuosity, Stothard’s
                    inauthentic medievalism, and Cromek’s crass commercialism.</p>
                <p>The most concrete evidence against the received account of the controversy,
                    however, is found in Blake’s published remarks on the affair. It is striking to
                    note that nowhere in the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> of 1809 does he
                    charge Cromek with stealing his idea for the <hi rend="i">Canterbury
                        Pilgrims.</hi> Rather, Blake tells us, his picture was painted “in
                    self-defence against the insolent and envious imputation of unfitness for
                    finished and scientific art.” Cromek’s rejection of his engraving for <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> now seemed a slander on his abilities which, he
                    hints, Cromek has “artfully and industriously endeavoured to be propagated among
                    the public by ignorant hirelings,” i.e., reviewers. He “courts comparison” with
                    his competitors (Cromek and Stothard) and accuses Cromek of having reaped
                    enormous profits from his designs for <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> by employing
                    another more docile engraver (Schiavonetti) to produce a work which has gained
                    both of them “public patronage,” while Blake’s designs “which gained them that
                    patronage are cried down as eccentricity and madness” (E 537-38). These
                    outbursts spring partly from Blake’s rage at the reviews of <hi rend="i">The
                        Grave</hi> in the latter half of 1808—first and foremost the Hunts’ <hi rend="i">Examiner</hi>—which attacked his designs as “indecent,” “absurd,”
                    “the offspring of a morbid fancy” which “has totally failed” in its aim, while
                    commending “the unrivalled graver of L. Schiavonetti.” However, these were only
                    salt in the wounds Blake was still nursing over Cromek’s substitution of
                    Schiavonetti as engraver, his failure to pay Blake what he now thought he
                    deserved for his designs, his outrageous letter of May 1807, and a number of
                    other grievances—now climaxed in Blake’s imagination by Cromek’s complicity in
                    the reviewers’ attacks.<ref target="n30" type="note">30</ref> But to all such
                    aspersions and calumnies, he asserts, “the works now exhibited will give the
                    lie.” Following this defense with an attack, Blake links Stothard with “a class
                    of men”—Reynolds and his followers in the Royal Academy—“whose whole art and
                    science is fabricated for the purpose of destroying art,” as Blake saw it, by
                    promoting Venetian over Florentine principles, coloring over drawing; he then
                    convicts such painters of “Stupidity” by a withering analysis of Stothard’s <hi rend="i">Procession</hi> as described in his Prospectus (E 538-40). <note id="n30"><hi rend="s">30</hi><hi rend="i"> BR</hi> 195-97, 199-208, 209-10.
                        Blake’s grievances include Cromek’s insistence on re-engraving Blake’s plate
                        for the frontispiece to Malkin’s <hi rend="i">Memoir</hi> in 1806 (Dennis M.
                        Read, “A New Blake Engraving: Gilchrist and the Cromek Connection” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 14 [1980]: 64); his failure to mention Blake by name
                        in several of the advertisements to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> (Bentley,
                        “Promotion” 351); his failure to acknowledge Blake’s contribution in his

                        Schiavonetti’s engravings (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 192-93); his omission of

                        inclusion of a glowing prospectus for the engraving of Stothard’s <hi rend="i">Procession</hi> at the end of the volume, announcing the

                    attack and defense to his engraving of the <hi rend="i">Pilgrims</hi>, decrying
                    the modern style of engraving of Bartolozzi and his followers as contaminated by
                    painterly principles of tone, and upholding his own work as founded firmly on
                    line. He rails especially against “the artfully propagated pretence” that “Great
                    Inventors” such as himself “cannot Execute,” or that “A Translation or a Copy of
                    any kind” can be as good as “An Original Invention”—in short, that an engraver
                    such as Schiavonetti can do justice to Blake’s own designs (E 572, 576, 582).
                    Clearly his humiliation over the Blair illustrations is still as much on his
                    mind as his need to promote his Chaucer engraving; but even if his protest
                    against his competitors’ Calumny &amp; the Arts of Trading Combination” (E 577)
                    is read as referring to the dispute over the <hi rend="i">Pilgrims</hi> rather
                    than to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, still it attacks Cromek not for stealing
                    his original idea but for maligning his abilities and for promoting Stothard’s
                    painting far more successfully than Blake did his own.<ref target="n31" type="note">31</ref><note id="n31"><hi rend="s">31</hi> The one allusion to

                        582: see 508, 540). Other references in the <hi rend="i">Descriptive

                <p>The failure of the 1809 Exhibition, followed by that of the Chaucer engraving (of
                    which he may have sold only seven or eight copies out of a printing of thirty or
                        so),<ref target="n32" type="note">32</ref> was a staggering blow, the climax
                    of a long series of disappointments and (as he saw them) betrayals since the end
                    of 1805. In the epigrams Blake began scribbling in his Notebook at about this
                    time, Cromek is prominent among the “foes” on whom he vents his rage: but the
                    terms of his attack deserve close scrutiny. Cromek is <pb id="p22-86" n="86"/><figure n="CanterburySteepleDetail.22.3.bqscan" rend="file"/> denounced as
                    “a petty sneaking knave,” who loves the art only of cheating, and who in trying
                    “to please everybody” has “set to work Both ignorance and skill”—i.e., has
                    employed Schiavonetti to engrave Blake’s designs for <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>
                    rather than Blake himself. The one possible reference to the <hi rend="i">Canterbury Pilgrims</hi> affair—and a murky one at that—occurs in the
                    enigmatic poem “And his legs carried it like a long fork” (E 503-04). This poem,
                    begun late in 1810, apparently celebrates Blake’s publication of his Chaucer
                    engraving ahead of Stothard’s, thereby frustrating the schemes of Screwmuch
                    (Cromek), Stewhard (Stothard), and Assassinetti (Schiavonetti) to cheat Blake
                    out of a just reward for his talents. Though Cromek has peddled Stothard’s
                    painting the length and breadth of Great Britain, it has been to no avail. His
                    “eggs” (the profits from the exhibition of Stothard’s painting) have been
                    “addled and decayed” by Schiavonetti’s death in June 1810 before finishing the
                    engraving which would have proved still more lucrative to Cromek, while at the
                    same time he has failed to turn “the wretched soul of William Blake” into “eggs
                    of gold” for his own profit. And when Cromek, almost penniless, died of
                    tuberculosis in 1812, Blake added some lines savagely exulting over his demise
                    as well as the deaths or misfortunes of other enemies and some former friends—an
                    alarming index to his state of mind at the time.<ref target="n33" type="note">33</ref><note id="n32"><hi rend="s">32</hi> Essick (<hi rend="i">Plates</hi> 60-70) lists 29 prints made during Blake’s lifetime. Actual
                        sales in Blake’s lifetime are recorded for only about seven copies (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 592 and 594, and Essick <hi rend="i">Plates</hi> 63,
                        64, 75, 76). The price was set at four guineas to subscribers in the 1809
                        prospectus (“to be considerably raised to Non-subscribers,” E 567), lowered
                        to three guineas in 1810, and sold for two or 2½ guineas in 1826-28 (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 592, 594-95, 607). The first three obituaries of Blake
                        failed to mention the <hi rend="i">Pilgrims</hi> among his other works; the
                        fourth described it as though it were unknown (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 348-50,
                        351-53, 354-55, 357).</note><note id="n33"><hi rend="s">33</hi> The
                        “enemies” include “Billy’s Lawyer” Rose—“Sweet Rose” (E 759)—his old friend
                        Flaxman, and his erstwhile employer Prince Hoare as well as the brothers
                        Hunt and the villainous dragoon Scholfield, who died in 1812 (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 669). “Dady Jack Hemps Parson” may be the Rev. Joseph Thomas, a
                        friend of Flaxman’s and a generous patron to Blake, who died in 1811 (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 674). “Dady” or “daddy” was a current term of contempt
                        for a prim old man (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> 53). “Cur, my Lawyer” is
                        probably Charles Ker, a barrister with whom Blake was embroiled in a lawsuit
                        in 1810, and whose father lost a famous and expensive lawsuit in 1812 (see
                            <hi rend="i">BR</hi> 227-28 and n3).</note></p>
                <p>Yet it is striking that Stothard, Flaxman, and Hayley come in for more frequent
                    and violent abuse in the Notebook poems than Cromek.<ref target="n34" type="note">34</ref> Stothard is compared to “The Fox, the Owl, the Beetle
                    &amp; the Bat” and is attacked as “the golden fool” who has “grown old and rich”
                    by observing “the golden rule,” the seeming “friend of all mankind” who is in
                    truth iron-hearted, wooden-headed, brazen-faced (E 508, 503). These verses
                    express Blake’s resentment of Stothard’s financial success and his coolness to
                    an old friend, however, rather than raise any charge of plagiarism. The animus
                    against Stothard seems excessive, especially in the light of Stothard’s
                    cordiality in 1806, when he is said to have promised to include a portrait of
                    Blake among his Pilgrims “as a mark of esteem for him and his works.”<ref target="n35" type="note">35</ref> When his painting appeared in 1807 it
                    contained no such portrait: but this would hardly account for Blake’s anger.
                    Perhaps Stothard in an expansive moment actually promised Blake the commission
                    for engraving his work—a promise that Cromek would have forced him to withdraw.
                    Such a hypothesis would at least account for the mysterious commission of a
                    Chaucer engraving which Blake believed he had received but which Cromek denied
                    he had ever given. Blake goes on in the Notebook to link Stothard with Flaxman
                    as his two Calibans, treacherous “old acquaintance” whom he “taught to see” but
                    who now “have shewn their backsides,” and who spread the poisonous rumor that
                    “Blakified drawing spoils painter &amp; engraver” (E 508, 505). The assault on
                    Flaxman, the innocent bystander, is surprising. Like Stothard he is accused of
                    copying Blake; but a more frequent accusation is that he has refused to believe
                    Blake and demanded “a proof of what he can’t perceive,” mocking Blake as a
                    “madman”—who replies by calling him a “blockhead” (E 507, 501). Perhaps this
                    exchange of insults was precipitated by Flaxman’s refusal to believe Blake’s
                    improbable story of Stothard’s casting a “malignant spell” on his original
                    sketch of the <hi rend="i">Pilgrims</hi> when Flaxman quizzed him, as he must
                    have done, on his reason for apparently copying Stothard’s design.<ref target="n36" type="note">36</ref><note id="n34"><hi rend="s">34</hi> Cromek

                        in 11 each (under their respective aliases in “And his legs carried it like
                        a long fork,”) (Erdman <hi rend="i">Concordance</hi> s.v.)</note><note id="n35"><hi rend="s">35</hi><hi rend="i"> Life</hi> 221.</note><note id="n36"><hi rend="s">36</hi> Flaxman evidently had a falling-out with Blake

                <p>Thus we are faced like Flaxman, and later J. T. Smith, with the difficult
                    question of how far we can take Blake’s word against Cromek and Stothard’s in
                    the matter. Discounting the story of supernatural influences on the mysterious
                    pencil sketch of 1805, how much can we believe of the account Blake gave Linnell
                    that Cromek saw his drawing of the Pilgrims, commissioned him to paint it for
                    twenty guineas, promised him the engraving fee in addition while secretly
                    negotiating with another <pb id="p22-87" n="87"/> engraver, then “sneaked” the
                    idea to Stothard when Blake refused to surrender his design? This account, as we
                    have seen, is backed by no external evidence and indeed conflicts with most of
                    the facts surrounding the matter. It is possible, of course, that Linnell’s
                    recollection in 1855 of his conversations with Blake around 1820 is at fault.
                    Like Smith’s memoir of 1828 his note on the affair contains some factual
                    inaccuracies, and in certain details—notably the promise of the engraving
                    commission subsequently withdrawn—it suspiciously resembles the episode of the
                        <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> illustrations, belonging also to the fall of 1805,
                    which may have fused with it in Linnell’s memory.<ref target="n37" type="note">37</ref> But, given Blake’s emotional state around 1809 and after, it seems
                    more likely that this fusion or confusion had already taken place in Blake’s
                    mind when he talked with Linnell a decade or so after the event, and that this
                    is the real origin of the story. Blake’s version of the affair is thus probably
                    a gradual reconfiguration of the events during his years of obscurity after
                    1810, when he had alienated all of his old friends and was left to brood over
                    their injustices in isolation.<ref target="n38" type="note">38</ref> In either
                    case, when all the contemporary evidence is taken into account the contemporary
                    understanding of the coincidence between the two Chaucer paintings seems the
                    probable one—that Blake commenced his picture in rivalry to Stothard’s (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 492, 209, 243-44). No disinterested witness at the time
                    supports Blake’s claim to priority, and the factual evidence all points in the
                    other direction. <note id="n37"><hi rend="s">37</hi> Linnell accepts Smith’s
                        misstatement that Blake himself had the original idea for the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> illustrations and has Blake starting work on his Chaucer
                        engraving in 1806 (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> 464 and n1), two years before
                        completing his painting and three years before he started to engrave it (E
                        567-68). The coincidences between the Blair and the Chaucer projects in
                        Linnell’s account are the commission with the 20 guinea fee for the designs;
                        the promise on which Cromek reneged that Blake would do the engraving; and
                        the negotiations behind Blake’s back with another engraver.</note><note id="n38"><hi rend="s">38</hi> Gilchrist’s statement (<hi rend="i">Life</hi>
                        247) that “to the end of his life” Blake would abuse Stothard to strangers
                        with “unaccountable vehemence,” while keeping silent to friends and
                        sympathizers about the affair, suggests that he sensed his side of the story
                        would not bear close examination.</note></p>
                <p>The difficult question remains of how Blake arrived at his conviction that the
                    idea for the Chaucer painting was originally his; and an answer here must be
                    almost completely speculative. It must start from the premise that Blake lived
                    in an eidetic world, thronged with precise visual images having the force of
                    reality, with a visual memory developed to an unusual degree by his training in
                    art and well-stocked with years of study of the work of other artists. Many of
                    his apparently original designs have been shown to be based on (probably
                    unconscious) recollections of other works, both contemporary and ancient, from a
                    wide range of sources—which is not to deny that what he borrowed from other
                    artists he transmuted into something wholly his own.<ref target="n39" type="note">39</ref> Like many of his other paintings, then, the <hi rend="i">Pilgrims</hi> may well have been an amalgamation of half-conscious
                    memories of other works under the pressure of some immediate stimulus. It may
                    well be that, as has been suggested, Blake saw the Elgin Marbles not long after
                    they were placed on exhibition in 1807 and this visual experience—especially in
                    conjunction with his view of Stothard’s <hi rend="i">Procession</hi> around the
                    same time—was the seed of his own conception. The sight of the actual Marbles
                    would certainly have brought to the surface of his memory the line engravings of
                    the Panathenaic Procession reproduced in Stuart and Revett’s <hi rend="i">Antiquities of Athens</hi>, which he had studied as a young man and which
                    are closer in feeling to his own work than the sculptures themselves. But quite
                    apart from the Marbles, Stothard’s procession evidently triggered a recollection
                    of two other cavalcades—those of two outsized engravings by Basire which have
                    been claimed were the primary influences on both the scale and the archaic style
                    of his <hi rend="i">Pilgrims</hi>—“The Field of the Cloth of Gold” (1774) and
                    “The Procession of Edward VI” (1787), the latter of which was especially close
                    to Blake’s design.<ref target="n40" type="note">40</ref> It seems, then, that
                    from all these recollections fusing in his visual memory arose a new image of
                    the same compelling vividness as the spiritual publications he described years
                    later to Crabb Robinson, to which the existence of actual manuscripts was
                    irrelevant—one of “those wonderful Originals seen in my visions” before he ever
                    set pencil to paper.<ref target="n41" type="note">41</ref> Thus Stothard’s
                    cavalcade would have appeared to him as a copy of an idea he had long had in
                    mind, which he gradually became convinced he had sketched a year or two before
                    seeing Stothard’s painting in progress. <note id="n39"><hi rend="s">39</hi> See

                        above). In addition to the frieze-like arrangement of the figures with
                        near-isocephaly noted by Essick, Blake’s design closely parallels Basire’s
                        in the gently rolling hills and dense foliage of the trees in the
                        background; in the architectural details of diamond-paned windows, Gothic
                        spires and gateway, and pillars enclosing sculptures of ecclesiastics; and
                        most of all in the horses and their trappings, an unlikely subject for
                        Blake. The similarities to the Parthenon frieze adduced by Macmillan (see
                        note 1 above) are generalized and remote by comparison—not only the human
                        figures but especially the horses. In the Panathenaic procession the horses
                        with their bare-back riders move from right to left in a bounding canter,
                        tossing their heads, with both forefeet usually off the ground; the London
                        cavalcade moves from left to right at a dignified walk or slow trot. Blake’s
                        improbable rendition of Chaucer’s horse with both left feet off the ground
                        at the same moment may result from his amalgamation of the front and rear
                        ends of two horses at the rear of the mounted procession in Basire’s print,
                        each partly obscured by a pillar: which suggests that he may have refreshed
                        his memory by another view of the print. Its heroic dimensions (22¾ × 52½
                        inches) are only slightly larger than those of Blake’s engraving (18⅜ × 53
                        15/16 inches).</note><note id="n41"><hi rend="s">41</hi><hi rend="i">

                <p>In conclusion, two points must be made. First, it appears that Cromek has been
                    “much maligned,” as William Bell Scott, a Victorian collector and editor of
                    Blake’s engravings, later opined. From Gilchrist onward he has been described as
                    “slippery,” “greedy,” “treacherous,” an opportunist who “picked the brains of
                    his proteges and stopped the pay.”<ref target="n42" type="note">42</ref> Partly
                    this may be due to the fact that the role of artistic and literary entrepreneur
                        <figure n="CanterburyTownDetail.22.3.bqscan" rend="file"/><pb id="p22-88" n="88"/> was still relatively new and not highly regarded in Blake’s
                        time;<ref target="n43" type="note">43</ref> it is also true that Cromek, who
                    seems to have operated on a very narrow margin of cash, was not generous in his
                    dealings and engaged in sharp and perhaps shady practices. Cromek was no hero:
                    he was quick-tempered, brash, disingenuous, and drove a hard bargain though to
                    no great financial return. Yet it has been claimed in the light of recent
                    evidence that he also showed “a surprising breadth of aesthetic and intellectual
                    sympathy” with Blake in the earlier stage of their relationship; moreover, that
                    he was the most reliable and conscientious of Robert Burns’s nineteenth-century
                    editors as well as an enterprising and energetic collector of unpublished
                        material.<ref target="n44" type="note">44</ref> Cromek’s career as a whole
                    awaits reassessment; in his relationship with Blake he should at the very least
                    be given credit for introducing Blake’s art to the widest public he was to have
                    in his lifetime with the designs to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, and doing
                    everything in his power to ensure the success of the work. <note id="n42"><hi rend="s">42</hi><hi rend="i"> Life</hi> 221, 250, 244, 252. See Wilson

                        his hard dealings with other business associates (<hi rend="i">Blair’s
                            Grave</hi> 18), and Bentley even blames “the obscurity and poverty of
                        Blake’s last years” on Cromek for discouraging Blake “from appealing
                        directly to the public” (“Blake and Cromek” 375-76). Dennis M. Read, who has
                        published valuable research on Cromek’s career, has raised doubts in
                        correspondence about several of the charges leveled against him by
                        Gilchrist, such as Cromek’s stealing an autograph letter by Ben Jonson from
                        Sir Walter Scott (<hi rend="i">Life</hi> 252-53) and failing to pay Stothard

                        “surprisingly Blakean . . . rhetoric” of Cromek’s 1810 obituary of
                        Schiavonetti, which must have struck Blake with considerable irony (<hi rend="i">Blair’s Grave</hi> 28-29).</note></p>
                <p>Yet a more significant point emerges when we shift from looking at the quarrel
                    with Cromek through the eyes of Blake to viewing Blake through the perspective
                    of the quarrel. Blake seems to have been driven to the edge of sanity in the
                    years surrounding his exhibition. As Bentley has suggested, between 1807 and
                    1812 the visionary world seemed often to supplant rather than to supplement the
                    ordinary world of causality in Blake’s mind, or—to put it another way—“a firm
                    perswasion that a thing is so, [seemed to] make it so.”<ref target="n45" type="note">45</ref> His relationship with Cromek is perhaps the most
                    telling example of his loosening grip on reality during those years, though few
                    of his readers have been willing to see it thus. Yet the belief which apparently
                    began to grow on him after 1810 that Cromek and Stothard had stolen his idea for
                    a painting from Chaucer is no more delusive than a number of other suspicions of
                    his friends and foes that he vented at the time.<ref target="n46" type="note">46</ref> But there is more to it than this. If Blake was in his Spectre’s
                    power in his dealings with Cromek, his Humanity was also awake and struggling,
                    like Los, to subdue it to the ends of art. It is one of the mysteries of
                    creativity that the imagination feeds on contraries, is stirred by the
                    experience of hate as well as love, by scorn and rivalry as well as admiration
                    and brotherhood, perhaps even by the petty as well as the sublime. We know what
                    the years at Felpham with Hayley contributed to the making of <hi rend="i">Milton.</hi> Robert Cromek must have appeared to Blake as “the Age’s
                    Knave,” the reincarnation of Chaucer’s Pardoner, the man “sent in every age for
                    a rod and scourge,” but “suffered by Providence for wise ends.” It is then a
                    providential irony that Blake’s conviction of Cromek’s villainy prompted him to
                    paint one of his grandest “Visions of the eternal principles or characters of
                    human life [which] appear to poets, in all ages” (E 535-36). Seen thus, Cromek
                    indeed had “his great use, and his grand leading destiny.” <note id="n45"><hi rend="s">45</hi><hi rend="i"> BR</hi> 180; E 38. It is significant that
                        the idiosyncratic word “delusion” in its several forms occurs only twice in
                        Blake’s work before <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> and 54 times thereafter
                            (<hi rend="i">Concordance</hi> s.v.). It appears that Blake recognized
                        in his own experience the power of hallucinatory images to take on the force
                        of reality.</note><note id="n46"><hi rend="s">46</hi> Blake’s complaint that
                        his designs have been rejected by the Royal Academy merely because they were
                        painted in watercolor (E 527; see Erdman 455n57); his statement that Cromek
                        made over 1400 guineas profit on <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> (E 537); his
                        insinuation that Cromek was responsible for the death of Schiavonetti (E
                        505); his claim that Flaxman “was blasting my character as an Artist to
                        Macklin, my Employer”in 1782-83 (E 572; see <hi rend="i">BR</hi> 610-11),
                        the very time at which Flaxman was finding influential patrons for Blake,
                        arranging for the printing of <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi>, assisting
                        in a plan to send Blake abroad, and generally promoting his reputation
                        (ibid. 24-27). Blake’s sneer at Hayley for “being a friend just in the nick”
                        to Cowper (E 507)—i.e., for neglecting Cowper’s needs and doubting his
                        genius while alive but capitalizing on his fame after his death by writing
                        his biography on a commission from “some book-seller”—is unfair and
                        inaccurate: see Morchard Bishop, <hi rend="i">Blake’s Hayley</hi> (London:
                        Gollancz, 1951) 152-85, 217-25, 252-53 on Hayley’s long drawn-out campaign
                        to secure a pension for Cowper, his extraordinary efforts to rescue Cowper
                        from depression, and his attempts to persuade the Rev. John Johnson and Lady
                        Hesketh to write Cowper’s biography until Lady Hesketh, Cowper’s cousin,
                        insisted that he was the proper person to do it. Blake’s accusation that
                        Hayley “when he could not act upon my wife / Hired a Villain to bereave my
                        Life” (E 506) is, in the light of Hayley’s generous assistance to Blake at
                        the time of his trial, paranoiac.</note></p>

          <p>The opening pages of the <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> or <hi rend="i">The Four
                            Zoas</hi> manuscript present perhaps the most difficult bibliographical
                        and interpretive cruxes in the entire manuscript. These pages have been
                        described as “one of the most heavily revised parts of the
                        poem” in which “the physical evidence in the
                        manuscript is sometimes highly confusing.”<ref target="n47" type="note">1</ref> Indeed, the “thicket of erased and
                        deleted original and additional lines”<ref target="n48" type="note">2</ref> has caused one critic to remark
                        “Certainly no creation myth has ever done a better job of
                        conveying a sense of the initial chaos out of which the world
                            began.”<ref target="n49" type="note">3</ref> The chaotic
                        state of pages 3 through 7 has made a definitive text of the Tharmas-Enion
                        conflict difficult to establish; however, recently Andrew Lincoln and David
                        Erdman have reexamined the opening pages of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>
                        and, as a result, helped our bibliographical understanding of the stages in
                        the genesis and growth of this text. Yet beyond the difficulties of
                        establishing a faithful rendering of Blake’s textual intentions,
                        the extensive erasures and rewritings which fill these pages reveal the
                        process of composition in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> The extensive
                        revisions suggest that the Tharmas character gradually evolved even as Blake
                        transcribed his manuscript and that the significance of the character
                        developed and in some cases shifted as he wrote and revised the first pages
                        of <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> or <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> In
                        Tharmas’ shifting characterization we can see a specific example
                        of Blake’s poetic process as he revised the tone, symbolism, and
                        form of his narrative. Indeed, as we shall see, the development of Tharmas
                        seems tied to the stress created within <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> as
                        it moves from a linear to nonlinear narrative.<ref target="n50" type="note">4</ref><note id="n47"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Andrew Lincoln, “<hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>: The Text of Pages 5, 6, &amp; 7, Night the

                            structural rather than developmental, it does not impinge directly on my
                            approach to the evolution of the Tharmas-Enion conflict.</note></p>
          <p>Blake seems to have invented Tharmas and Enion while writing <hi rend="i">The
                            Four Zoas</hi>, since they do not appear in his earlier works.<ref target="n51" type="note">5</ref> It is not altogether certain, however,
                        that Tharmas, in particular, played a significant role in Blake’s
                        plan of the poem even at the time he began to transcribe it. Pages 4-6,
                        those in which the narrative first introduces Tharmas and Enion, are a mass
                        of erasures and rewritings in which different layers of text may be seen but
                        not easily distinguished from one another. The earliest text, the
                        transcription in Blake’s “copperplate
                            hand,”<ref target="n52" type="note">6</ref> is almost
                        entirely obscured. Indeed, the extent of these erasures suggests a radical
                        departure by Blake from his original text on these pages. As the existence
                        of two Nights VII indicates, Blake was loath to discard any text if he
                        thought he could salvage anything from it. Thus, it seems possible that the
                        revised text differs radically in tone, image, or perhaps even character
                        from the original transcription. Such a complete change in the story could
                        help to explain why such radical revisions were brought to these opening
                        pages. Margoliouth, the only critic to speculate at length on this problem,
                        argues that <q> There is evidence that Vala originally played a larger part
                            in Night I. . . . How Vala came into the lost eighty or so lines of the
                            beginning of . . . [the earliest erased text of <hi rend="i">Vala</hi>]
                            I cannot even conjecture, but somehow she must be identifiable with the
                            Woman-Serpent which Enion becomes at the moment of her mating . . . [7].
                            The Woman-Serpent in the text there, in the drawing below and in the
                            drawing on . . . [13], must be identifiable with the Woman-Serpent
                            (Woman-Dragon) of the drawing on . . . [26], which represents Vala as
                            described by Luvah.<ref target="n53" type="note">7</ref></q><pb id="p22-94" n="94"/> The exact nature of this earlier story remains and
                        may always remain in question. It does seem likely, though, that the top
                        layer of text was written considerably later than the rest of the
                        copperplate text and perhaps even later than pages 43-84 of the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> proof sheets. The surface text contains references
                        to characters and ideas such as Jerusalem, the Daughters of Beulah, and sin
                        and atonement not present in the basic transcription of pages 43-84. This
                        text also contains passages used in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, and thus it
                        seems likely that the surface layer of pages 4-6 is a relatively late
                        addition to the manuscript. <note id="n51"><hi rend="s">5</hi> Tharmas and

          <p>The only surviving copperplate appearances of Tharmas occur in two brief
                        instances where he is little more than a name. In Night I, Los alludes to
                        the “cold expanse where watry Tharmas mourns” (11:27),
                        and in Night II Blake writes that the windows in the “golden
                        Building” (32:10) raised by Urizen and his sons <q> Lookd out
                            into the world of Tharmas, where in ceaseless torrents<lb/> His billows

                                    not, as the editors point out, comment extensively on the
                                    poem’s textual development: <q> for the present

                                        completeness—so much of which is <hi rend="i">not</hi> represented in the designs; so much of which
                                        is entangled in its own problems of interpretation and
                                        uncompleted revisions (and undeciphered cancelations). (16)
                                    </q></note></q> Here Tharmas seems merely a ruler over a watery chaos set in contrast
                        to Urizen’s ordered world. His world, with its
                        “ceaseless torrents” and “monsters [that]
                        wander in the foamy paths,” seems to be an imminent threat to
                        that of Urizen. Tharmas, thus, appears to be a sea god, like Poseidon, set
                        in opposition to a Zeus-like sky god.<ref target="n55" type="note">9</ref>
                        The juxtaposition of Tharmas’ chaotic world against
                        Urizen’s world of light and order seems to say more about Urizen
                        than Tharmas. It is designed to emphasize the precarious nature of
                        Urizen’s endeavors and remind the reader that Urizen has not
                        conquered the chaos of matter on which his world is built, but only
                        circumscribed a portion of it. Blake may also have intended, however, that
                        the brief appearance of Tharmas’ world of “ceaseless
                        torrents” would adumbrate the world of disorder that follows the
                        collapse of Urizen’s world of order. <note id="n55"><hi rend="s">9</hi> This opposition is played out more fully in Night IV where
                            Tharmas enlists the help of Los to rebuild his watery world after the
                            collapse of Urizen’s golden one. It should be remembered that
                            Tharmas first appears in Night III as a product of the confusion and
                            chaos created by the separation of Urizen and Ahania, and therefore he
                            appears as a figure in symbolic opposition to them. Although the lines
                            in Night IV are physically later in the narrative of the manuscript, it
                            seems that they were likely transcribed before the revisions to the
                            early part of Night I describing Tharmas, since Night IV presents a more
                            simplified picture of him and does not define him as a
                            “Spectre.”</note></p>
          <p>In her first copperplate appearance, Enion is described as brooding
                        “oer the rocks, the rough rocks” (8:12) of the barren
                        world Los and Enitharmon are born into. Her brooding causes “the
                        rough rocks” to “vegetate” and give rise to
                        the forms of nature which protect “the bright Infants from the
                        desolating winds” (8:20) of a hostile world. Her laments
                        emphasize her role as a nurturing earth-mother figure; unfortunately, Enion
                        is forced to substitute tares for crops, pestilence and famine for
                        nourishment, hypocrisy for truth in fallen nature: <q> I am made to sow
                            thistle for wheat; the nettle for a nourishing dainty<lb/> I have
                            planted a false oath in the earth, it has brought forth a poison
                            tree<lb/><lb/> . . .<lb/><lb/> I have taught the thief a secret path
                            into the house of the just<lb/> I have taught pale artifice to spread
                            his nets upon the morning<lb/> My heavens are brass my earth is iron my
                            moon a clod of clay<lb/> My sun a pestilence burning at noon &amp;
                            a vapour of death in night.<lb/> (35:1-2, 7-10) </q> Her laments serve
                        mainly to punctuate the endings of Nights I and II, casting a sense of
                        desolation over the marriage feast of Night I and Urizen’s newly
                        planted “Golden World” (32:8) in Night II. Beyond
                        these laments, however, her identity in the poem seems some-what
                        limited.</p>

          <p>Blake appears to have begun his development, or redevelopment, of the
                        Tharmas-Enion story on pages 3-7 by transferring a portion of his text on
                        page 7 to page 5. Under a series of erasures on page 7, Erdman conjecturally
                        reconstructs the following lines, apparently describing Tharmas: <q>
                            ?Weeping, then bending from his Clouds he stoopd his innocent head<lb/>
                            ?And stretching out his holy hand in the vast Deep sublime<lb/> ?Turnd
                            round the circle of Destiny with tears &amp; bitter sighs<lb/> And
                            said Return O Wanderer when the day of clouds is o’er<lb/> So
                            saying he . . . ?fell . . . into the restless sea<lb/> Round rolld ?the
                            . . . globe self balanc’d.<lb/> (E 821-22) </q> He then
                        points out that “All six [lines] were apparently moved to p 5 for
                        the modified copperplate addition there of lines 9-14 and 25” (E
                        822). Andrew Lincoln has noted that the Tharmas figure described in these
                        lines is called “innocent” in contrast with the
                        jealous, malevolent figure in the chronologically later text of pages 4-6.
                        The evil tendencies of Tharmas, then, would only emerge after the
                        “innocent” Tharmas falls into the sea.<ref target="n56" type="note">10</ref> The result of Lincoln’s
                        argument is to demonstrate that Blake had two different ideas of Tharmas and
                        that much of the revision on pages 5-7 was an attempt to reconcile the two
                            figures.<ref target="n57" type="note">11</ref> On one hand, we have
                        Tharmas, the <pb id="p22-95" n="95"/> victim, bending his
                        “innocent head” from the clouds, turning the
                        “circle of Destiny” and falling into the sea where he
                        is woven into a spectrous form by Enion; on the other, we have the proud,
                        malicious, Spectre-like Tharmas who asserts his will over Enion and finally
                        rapes her. Though Lincoln’s argument is compelling, it rests in
                        part upon the idea that the earliest text on these opening pages always
                        referred to the union of Tharmas and Enion. While this is possible, it is by
                        no means inevitable. The text reconstructed by Erdman does not name the male
                        or female figures, and not until this passage is moved to page 5 are their
                        identities firmly established as Enion and Tharmas. Furthermore, from my own
                        examination of the manuscript in the British museum, I have found that it is
                        not always possible to tell which erased text is the earliest copperplate
                        one. <note id="n56"><hi rend="s">10</hi> Andrew Lincoln, “<hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>” 91.</note><note id="n57"><hi rend="s">11</hi> Kathleen Raine, <hi rend="i">Blake and

                            discusses the two-sided nature of Tharmas in terms of possible
                            alchemical sources.</note></p>
          <p>However, once Blake had decided to transfer his text from page 7 to page 5,
                        for whatever reason and at whatever stage of composition, he began to rework
                        the intervening pages in two fairly distinct phases. It seems that the lines
                        4:7-11, 18-16, 5:6-12, 14, 16-19, 23-28, 46-55, 57 and 6:5-27, 32-37
                        represent a single phase of rewriting, since they seem to be centered over
                        the erased text, appear in the same writing style and are consistent in
                        tone, image and narrative setting.<ref target="n58" type="note">12</ref> The
                        emphasis on fear, terror, jealousy, hatred and delusive beauty characterizes
                        these passages as much later than the copperplate transcription of Night I.
                        I suspect that this stage of revision is concurrent with or follows the
                        revision of the Los-Enitharmon and Urizen-Ahania stories in Nights I and II.
                        An almost cynical emphasis on love and jealousy as motive forces in
                        male-female relationships and a tendency to place the female in the more
                        sinister role seem characteristic of the revision in both stories.
                        References to love and jealousy are far less pronounced in the basic
                        copperplate text; for the most part, Blake’s later revisions of
                        this text tend to magnify these elements only suggested in the early
                        transcription of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> It is probable, then, that
                        the passages in the Tharmas-Enion conflict were added as a unit while Blake
                        worked on the rest of the poem, heightening “The torments of Love
                        &amp; Jealousy,” and were intended to introduce Tharmas and
                        Enion more fully earlier in the narrative in preparation for
                        Tharmas’ appearances, in particular, in the text after page 43.
                            <note id="n58"><hi rend="s">12</hi> I do have some reservations about
                            6:5-8 in this grouping. They appear to be written higher on the page
                            than the erased portion of text on page 6 and may have been added
                            slightly later than the other lines I have included here. This idea is
                            supported by the narrative connection between
                            5:57—“But standing on the Rocks her woven shadow
                            glowing bright”—and
                            6:11—“Searching for glory wishing that the heavens
                            had eyes to See.” Perhaps, then, the text on page 6 during
                            this phase of rewriting began at line 6:11; however, lines 6:5-8 have
                            little that would characterize them as distinctly later than the rest of
                            this phase of rewriting. Presumably, they were added much earlier than
                            the other obvious additions to pages 3-6.</note></p>
          <p>The structure of this text seems fairly simple. Tharmas laments the loss of
                        his Emanations and calls for Enion to “come forth”
                        (4:8). She appears and proclaims that “All love is lost Terror
                        succeeds &amp; Hatred instead of Love / And stern demands of Right
                        &amp; Duty instead of Liberty” (4:19-20). Then, in an
                        attempt to shield herself from his terrifying appearance, she begins to
                        weave a “tabernacle of delight” (5:7) for herself
                        which upon its completion becomes “the circle of
                        Destiny” (5:11). Tharmas subsequently emerges from
                        Enion’s loom in the form of a Spectre and after glorying in his
                        own beauty, terrorizes and finally rapes Enion. The relative lateness of
                        this text is suggested by the fact that specific terms such as
                        “Emanation” and “Spectre” are
                        not used in the text before revisions: “Emanation” is
                        not found in the base text of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> nor is the
                        term “Spectre” applied to Tharmas in the narrative of
                        the following Nights. Moreover, the weaving imagery used as a specifically
                        feminine evil activity only appears in arguably late portions of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> and thus would add to the evidence that this
                        text on pages 5-6 is relatively late.<ref target="n59" type="note">13</ref><note id="n59"><hi rend="s">13</hi> Morton D. Paley, in “The

                        seem significantly later than the preceding phase of rewriting. They
                        introduce the ideas of sin and repentance common in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> but found only in the added pages 86-90 of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> Moreover, this language of sin and repentance is
                        further allied with feminine delusiveness and weaving
                        imagery—Enion states, “I thought to weave a Covering
                            [<hi rend="i">from</hi>] &lt;for&gt; my Sins from wrath
                        of Tharmas” (6:38)—as it is in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi><ref target="n60" type="note">14</ref> Blake also revised specific lines in his earlier
                        text to include these new ideas of sin and repentance. “Jealous
                        Despair” becomes “Silent Contrition” in
                        4:10 and the “Seas of Trouble &amp; rocks of
                        sorrow” become “Seas of &lt;Doubt&gt;
                        &amp; rocks of &lt;Repentance&gt;” in 5:51.
                        Furthermore, Blake changed “false woven bliss” to
                        “Repentance &amp; Contrition” in 5:28. <note id="n60"><hi rend="s">14</hi><hi rend="i"> Milton</hi> 18[20]:30;E 111, 22[24]:38;E 117. <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 21:11-12;E 166, 64:1-5;E 215, 80:62-65;E 237,

          <p>Throughout these two phases of revision, however, the source of Tharmas and
                        Enion’s strife shifts at least three times, and as it shifts, so
                        does the characterization of Tharmas and Enion. In the first stage, strife
                        exists solely between Tharmas and Enion with no third party involved.
                        Moreover, Tharmas is clearly the oppressor of Enion. Tharmas, in the
                        earliest surviving reading of lines 10-11 on page 4, states, “I
                        have hidden thee Enion in Jealous Despair / I will build thee a Labyrinth
                        where we <pb id="p22-96" n="96"/> may remain for ever alone.”
                        These lines begin a story of Tharmas’ jealousy and possessiveness
                        that prepares for his later appearance as the domineering Spectre with Enion
                        as his victim. Enion’s response, after their initial argument, is
                        to weave “A tabernacle of delight” (5:7) which entraps
                        Tharmas, but there is no suggestion that she weaves it for Enitharmon or
                        Jerusalem, as later revisions show.</p>
          <p>While modifying the first phase of rewriting pages 4 through 7, Blake
                        complicates the Tharmas-Enion conflict by the addition of Enitharmon as a
                        source of strife. Enitharmon’s presence in the story gives an
                        external object for the story of jealousy. As a result, blame for strife in
                        the Tharmas-Enion relationship shifts over to Enion. Blake revises
                        Tharmas’ opening speech to read <q> I have hidden
                            &lt;Enitharmon&gt; in Jealous Despair O Pity Me<lb/> I
                            will build thee a Labyrinth &lt;also O pity me O
                            Enion&gt;<lb/> &lt;Why hast thou taken Enitharmon from
                            my inmost Soul<lb/> Let her Lay secret in the Soft recess of darkness
                            &amp; silence<lb/> It is not Love I bear to Enitharmon It is
                            Pity<lb/> She hath taken refuge in my bosom &amp; I cannot cast her
                            out&gt;<lb/> (4:10-15) </q> In revision Blake brings out the
                        pitying quality that Tharmas is generally noted for but that was virtually
                        nonexistent in the first stage of revision. The cry for pity, even the wrong
                        kind of pity, tends to make Tharmas a little more sympathetic; at the same
                        time, Enion’s jealousy towards Enitharmon may now qualify our
                        sympathy for her.</p>
          <p>The myth, as told here, is elaborated in one of the last additions to Night I
                        and indeed the entire poem. On page 22, thought by Bentley to be added
                        sometime after 1805 and the transcription of Night VIII (B 165), Blake tells
                        of Urthona’s experience of the fall and how <q> dividing from his
                            aking bosom fled<lb/> A portion of his life shrieking upon the wind she
                            fled<lb/> And Tharmas took her in pitying Then Enion in jealous
                            fear<lb/> Murderd her &amp; hid her in her bosom embalming her for
                            fear<lb/> She should arise again to life Embalmd in Enions bosom<lb/>
                            Enitharmon remains a corse such thing was never known<lb/>
                            &lt;In Eden that one died a death never to be
                            revivd&gt;.<lb/> (22:20-26) </q> Blake had used the idea of the
                        love triangle as early as <hi rend="i">The Visions of the Daughters of
                            Albion</hi>, but this mythic mode of expressing it was part of a later
                        development. In particular, the interchangeable nature of the female
                        Emanation, fleeing from one Zoa to seek refuge with another, is a later
                        development very important to <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> Before the composition of <hi rend="i">The Four
                            Zoas</hi>, Blake had written of Enitharmon splitting from
                        Los’ side or of Ahania “Cast out from thy
                        [Urizen’s] lovely bosom” (<hi rend="i">Book of
                            Ahania</hi> 5:40; E 90), but he had not yet fully developed the idea
                        that Emanations could leave one male figure’s bosom and enter
                        another. Not until <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> does Blake present the most
                        highly developed explication of the Emanative function: <q> When in Eternity
                            Man converses with Man they enter<lb/> Into each others Bosom (which are
                            Universes of delight)<lb/> In mutual interchange. and first their
                            Emanations meet<lb/> Surrounded by their Children. if they embrace
                            &amp; comingle<lb/> The Human Four-fold Forms mingle also in
                            thunders of Intellect<lb/> But if the Emanations mingle not; with storms
                            &amp; agitations<lb/> Of earthquakes &amp; consuming fires
                            they roll apart in fear<lb/> For Man cannot unite with Man but by their
                            Emanations<lb/> Which stand both Male &amp; Female at the Gates of
                            each Humanity.<lb/> (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 88:3-11; E 246) </q> In the
                        Lambeth books, after leaving the male source, the female Emanation either
                        becomes highly assertive over the male, as Enitharmon ultimately does or,
                        like Ahania, becomes “a faint shadow wandring / . . . / As the
                        moon anguishd circles the earth” (<hi rend="i">Book of
                            Ahania</hi> 2:38, 40; E 85). There is never any mention of one Emanation
                        fleeing into the bosom of a male figure who is not her place of origin
                        (e.g., Enitharmon entering Urizen’s bosom or Ahania fleeing to
                        Los).</p>
          <p>As Blake revises the story of Tharmas and Enion, he connects the source of
                        their strife to a breakdown in the free movement of Emanations. At the end
                        of Tharmas’ opening speech, Blake adds, “The Men have
                        received their death wounds &amp; their Emanations are fled / To me for
                        refuge &amp; I cannot turn them out for Pitys Sake”
                            (4:16-17.<ref target="n61" type="note">15</ref> Blake anticipates (or
                        repeats?) his own idea developed in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> that
                        Jerusalem herself is an Emanation comprised of the Emanations of all men
                        just as Albion is seen as the composite form of the human imagination. Thus
                        the “Emanations” which flee to Tharmas <pb id="p22-97" n="97"/> for refuge are symbolized by the figure of Jerusalem who hides
                        in Tharmas’ bosom. We see here that Tharmas has begun to take on
                        a fairly significant role as the repository of the creative emanative power
                        of humanity which survives the fall. Unfortunately, Tharmas’
                        secretive and deceptive protection of these Emanations demonstrates that his
                        attitudes to the emanative process are perverted by the fall. By hiding
                        these Emanations, he begins separating himself from his own Emanation and
                        falls further into the chaos of fallen existence. <note id="n61"><hi rend="s">15</hi> Note that Enion’s lines at 7:3-8 appear
                            to be part of this revision.</note></p>
          <p>Yet the idea that Tharmas acts as a repository for man’s
                        redemptive Emanations suggests that Blake saw him as an increasingly
                        important figure or quality to be tapped in the process of undoing the
                        effects of the fall. The Circle of Destiny is composed, at least in part,
                        from the fibers of his being, and although it may be a constraining force of
                        destiny, it does help put a limit to the chaos existing at the beginning of
                        the poem. Moreover, when Tharmas reemerges from the chaos resulting from the
                        collapse of Urizen’s world in Night IV, he is instrumental in
                        initiating the reconstruction of the collapsed universe. Ultimately,
                        Tharmas, along with the Spectre of Urthona infuses power into Los which
                        enables him to tear down the sun and moon, bringing about the Last Judgement
                        (107:32-35). These features point to Tharmas’ potential
                        importance in the poem as the “Parent Power,” as a
                        kind of encompassing form, central to the substructure of the
                        poem’s mythology. Blake was later able to exploit these features
                        in the revisions to Night I, making Tharmas a figure containing the seeds of
                        destruction and recreation. These changes seem designed to make him an
                        increasingly more central figure.</p>
          <p>In the basic development of female-male relationships, however, many elements
                        of the Enion-Tharmas story as Blake revises it in pages 3-7 resemble the
                        interactions in the notebook poem, “My Spectre around me night
                        &amp; day,”<ref target="n62" type="note">16</ref> and
                        “The Mental Traveller” of the 1800-04 period.<ref target="n63" type="note">17</ref> In “My Spectre around
                        me,” the Spectre, like Tharmas, complains that his Emanation,
                        like Enion, murders his sweet Loves and seems to have the power of life or
                        death over them and him: he pleads <q> When wilt thou return &amp;
                            view<lb/> My loves &amp; them to life renew<lb/> When wilt thou
                            return &amp; live<lb/> When wilt thou pity as I forgive.<lb/>
                            (29-32; E 476) </q> The note of lament for the absent loved one who
                        causes such pain is also typical of Tharmas’ complaints. Further,
                        the counter accusations of sin by Tharmas (6:29-31) and Enion (4:27-41) are
                        paralleled in what appears to be a postscript to “My Spectre
                        around me”: <q> Oer my Sins Thou sit &amp; moan<lb/> Hast
                            thou no Sins of thy own<lb/> Oer my Sins thou sit &amp; weep<lb/>

                            55, dates it after August 1803. Despite this disagreement between
                            Bentley and Erdman, it seems safe to assume that based on similarities
                            in symbolism, character, and tone, this poem was written during roughly
                            the same period when Blake was reworking the opening of <hi rend="i">Vala.</hi></note><note id="n63"><hi rend="s">17</hi> Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>
                            342, notes that the earliest this poem could have been written in its
                            present form is 1802, since it is written on blank leaves from
                            Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> of that year. However,
                            Bentley qualifies this late date by noting that “The dates of
                            original composition may well be 1800-4 for the Ballads Manuscript
                            poems.” A date of soon after 1800 would correspond roughly
                            with the time Blake was working on the Tharmas-Enion
                        material.</note></p>
          <p>In addition, Enion resembles the “Woman Old” of
                        “The Mental Traveller”—a poem written in
                        the same period as “My Spectre” and which describes a
                        similar relationship—who binds her love and <q> Her fingers
                            number every Nerve<lb/> Just as a Miser counts his gold<lb/> She lives

                            old.<lb/> (17-20; E 484) </q> Enion torments Tharmas in similar terms:
                            <q> In [<hi rend="i">dismal</hi>] &lt;gnawing&gt; pain
                            drawn out by her lovd fingers every nerve<lb/> She counted. every vein

                            intoxication of false woven bliss.<lb/> (5:16-19, 26-28) </q> Only the
                        added note of terror differentiates the picture of Enion from that of the
                        “Woman Old”; yet the “sweet
                        intoxication” of her actions seems to mitigate Enion’s
                        terror. Thus, it appears that the changing face of the Tharmas-Enion story
                        is linked to a widespread development in Blake’s presentation of
                        the male-female conflict in terms of what he would ultimately depict between
                        the Spectre and Female Will. Although his latest revisions were not
                        thoroughly consistent, Blake eventually replaced
                        “Enitharmon” with “Jerusalem” in
                        Tharmas’ opening speech. It seems probable that Blake made this
                        change around the time he added the ideas of language of Sin and Repentance
                        to his text. The concurrence of these additions is by no means certain;
                        however, their thematic congruency could not be overlooked by Blake. <pb id="p22-98" n="98"/> As a scene of love and jealousy expanded to include
                        the language of sin and repentance, it seems logical that Blake might decide
                        to locate the source of controversy in Jerusalem, a victimized biblical
                        figure of increasing importance his later writings. Moreover, both elements
                        share a common relative lateness in the manuscript.<ref target="n64" type="note">18</ref> Basically, the emotional conflict between Tharmas
                        and Enion remains the same in this love triangle except that Tharmas has
                        “Hidden &lt;Jerusalem [instead of Enitharmon] in Silent
                        Contrition&gt;” (4:10), and he now asks Enion,
                        “&lt;Why hast thou taken sweet Jerusalem from my inmost
                        Soul&gt; (4:12). Blake did not, however, carry out these revisions
                        in Tharmas’ plea, “It is not Love I bear to Enitharmon
                        It is Pity” (4:14) or in the story told by the messengers from
                        Beulah on page 22, and this fact leads me to assume either that the change
                        was only very tentative or that Blake “accidentally neglected
                        making the same change here as in lines 9 and 11, and 5:7” (E
                        819). Moreover, Blake’s incomplete revision of the
                        Enion-Tharmas-Jerusalem triangle may have signalled his temporary
                        abandonment of the text of pages 5-7. <note id="n64"><hi rend="s">18</hi> If
                            the addition of Enitharmon to the Tharmas-Enion conflict is concurrent
                            with the addition of pages 20-22 to the manuscript, as I suggested
                            earlier, then the addition of Jerusalem to the conflict (and also the
                            language of Sin and Repentance) would be very late indeed, perhaps the
                            latest addition to the entire poem.</note></p>

            <title>III</title>
          </head>
          <p>In the process of developing and later deleting the text of pages 4-6, Blake
                        put his characters through a series of interesting changes.
                        Blake’s tampering with this text is quite revealing in terms of
                        his development of the relationship between Tharmas and Enion and their
                        characterization. In lines 9-15 on page 6 Tharmas is described in
                        “self admiring raptures” (6:13) <q> wishing that the
                            heavens had eyes to See<lb/> And courting that the Earth would ope her
                            Eyelids &amp; behold<lb/> Such wondrous beauty repining in the
                            midst of all his glory<lb/> That nought but Enion could be forced to
                            praise adore &amp; love.<lb/> (6:9-12) </q> In a subsequent passage
                        (6:26-35) Tharmas finds that Enion does not admire him half as much as he
                        himself does, rebukes her accusations of sin (26-28), asserts his own moral
                        purity against her supposed sins (29-31) and proclaims himself god over her
                        tortured soul (32-35). Finally, he accuses her of being a false temptress
                        (7:12-17) who first wants him to “hide thee with my power and
                        delight thee with my beauty” (13) but then “darknest
                        in my presence” (14) when he does appear. Thus, he decides
                        “In my jealous wings / I evermore will hold thee when thou goest
                        out or comest in” (15-16). Throughout these lines, we see Blake
                        developing the most negative aspects of the Spectre which he later called
                        the “Selfhood.” The net effect of these passages is to
                        polarize the innocent and evil sides of Tharmas into two distinct
                        characters. On the one hand, we have the innocent Tharmas, a victim of the
                        fall caused by the war between Luvah and Urizen; on the other, we find the
                        malevolent Spectre of Tharmas, the perversion of the victimized Tharmus,
                        bent on dominating and destroying Enion. It is not surprising to find that
                        as Tharmas grows more evil, Enion becomes a more sympathetic (or simply
                        pathetic) victim.</p>
          <p>In her first speech in this section (5:46-55, 57), Enion repents of weaving
                        Tharmas into a Spectre, an act in which “Love is changed to
                        deadly Hate” (48) and laments the feeling that her
                        “Soul has lost its splendor &amp; a brooding Fear / Shadows
                        me oer &amp; drives me outward to a world of woe” (53-54).
                        Following the description of Tharmas’ “self admiring
                        raptures,” Enion laments her solitude and calls out for Tharmas
                        whom she does not recognize in his Spectre form (6:16-25). And finally, she
                        repents for slaying Tharmas’ Emanations and defies the
                        Spectre’s perceived temptation that she “murder my own
                        soul &amp; wipe my tears &amp; smile” (6:36-7:11). In
                        Blake’s rather patchy narrative here, it appears that the
                        victimized Tharmas sinks beneath the waves of Enion’s
                        “filmy Woof” (5:14) after turning “round
                        the circle of Destiny” (5:11). This
                        “innocent” Tharmas does not reappear until pages 43-44
                        where he arises from the watery ruin of Urizen’s world. Enion,
                        through her weaving, draws out the Spectre of Tharmas from the nerves and
                        veins of the innocent Tharmas.<ref target="n65" type="note">19</ref> The
                        narrative then follows the Spectre’s rape of Enion, after which
                        he seems to disappear from the narrative. Blake leaves some clues suggesting
                        that, in mingling with Enion, the Spectre becomes one with her in a perverse
                        attempt to dominate and at the same time unify with her. His influence
                        continues in the birth of Los and Enitharmon and the “Spectrous
                        Life” (9:4) they draw from Enion. Ultimately, this spectrous
                        quality would seem to emerge in the Spectre of Urthona. In a sense, this
                        chronicle reinforces the connection between Tharmas and Urthona as brothers
                        in Eternity and allies in the war against Urizen while trapped in the fallen
                        world. Again, the revisions of these opening pages make Tharmas a more
                        central figure. In his Spectre form, he stands as the starting point for the
                        spectrous qualities which enter the fallen world. <note id="n65"><hi rend="s">19</hi> Blake also mentions the “World of
                            Tharmas” at 33:6. This passage, as part of the early
                            copperplate text, does not contain enough information to state clearly
                            which Tharmas Blake meant here; however, the later narrative context
                            created after the revisions to Night I suggests a logical connection
                            with the innocent Tharmas trapped beneath the waves until he arises in
                            Night III.</note></p>
          <p>Blake seems uncertain, however, about the degree of malevolence to attribute
                        to the Spectre of Tharmas. Like the Spectre of Urthona—perhaps
                        the first use of the idea of a Spectre—the Spectre of Tharmas
                        arises as the product of sexual dissension and division, a perverted <hi rend="i">dopplegänger</hi> for an eternal identity,<ref target="n66" type="note">20</ref> and represents a <pb id="p22-99" n="99"/> spirit of despair and self-destruction. In particular, the
                        Spectre of Tharmas seems an inversion of Tharmas’ unanswered
                        desire for pity into a tyrannical attempt instill terror and dominate or
                        destroy the appearance of weakness in others, especially Enion. This
                        entirely negative presentation of the Spectre seems more in keeping with the
                        bat-winged, devouring figure in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and lacks the
                        potentially redemptive memory of eternity that we see in the Spectre of
                        Urthona in Night VIIa.<ref target="n67" type="note">21</ref> Thus at some
                        point, Blake sought to moderate this confrontation of extremes and deleted
                        all of the above passages with grey wash, diagonal ink strokes or both. The
                        result of this deletion was to neutralize the characterization of Tharmas
                        somewhat and to confine his violent nature to the union with Enion
                        (7:21-26). But another problem arises as a result of such extensive
                        deletions. Enion has now lost much of the sympathetic quality that her
                        laments gave her, and the keynote of her repentance is entirely lost. She is
                        now merely a character acting out of sorrow and terror, weaving her lover
                        into a terrible Spectre. Therefore, Blake may have decided to circle certain
                        passages to be readmitted to the final version of Night I. <note id="n66"><hi rend="s">20</hi> Nelson Hilton, <hi rend="i">Literal

          <p>At one time the ink circles around certain passages on pages 5, 6 and 7 were
                        seen as part of Blake’s process of deletion, but Andrew Lincoln
                        has demonstrated that these circles were actually used by Blake to set off
                        material that was to be saved from the mass of deletions on the page and
                        that Blake had added to these passages after they were struck out and
                            circled.<ref target="n68" type="note">22</ref> Blake leaves the passage
                        concerning Tharmas’ “self admiring
                        raptures” deleted, possibly because the line preceding
                        it—“Glorying in his own eyes Exalted in terrific
                        Pride” (6:8)—carries the essential significance of the
                        7 deleted lines (6:9-15). Blake also leaves out the previously deleted
                        passage in which Tharmas condemns Enion as a temptress (7:12-17). This
                        passage is useful in offering a clear explanation for Tharmas’
                        violent attack, but perhaps Blake felt that the venom in the one passage he
                        returned to the text was strong enough to get his point across. Thus,
                        Tharmas’ rebuke of Enion and his proclamation of himself as a god
                        of moral purity over her tortured soul (6:26-35) is circled in order to be
                        retained for a later version of the poem. The modified version of these
                        lines (6:26-27, 29-35)<ref target="n69" type="note">23</ref> expands
                        Tharmas’ accusation that Enion is a “sinful
                        Woman” (the deleted line 7:12), and perhaps this is another
                        partial explanation for leaving 7:12-17 deleted. Further, Blake probably
                        retained these lines because they present an essential expression of the
                        Spectrous aspect of Tharmas’ character and also because they
                        establish an aspiration to godhood and moral purity that is characteristic
                        of Tharmas and the rest of the Zoas and increasingly becomes a central
                        concern for Blake. In these respects, this passage seems to supersede the
                        characterization developed in the passages which Blake did not circle to
                        retain for later use.<ref target="n70" type="note">24</ref><note id="n68"><hi rend="s">22</hi> Lincoln, “<hi rend="i">The

                            (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1978) 74, point out that in Night III,
                            “Urizen’s insistence that Ahania is
                            ‘diminutive’ repeats the pattern of
                            Tharmas’s rejection of Enion in Night I; in both instances a
                            domineering character projects his own smallness or sense of it onto his
                            more passive partner.” In a note to this discussion, Wilkie
                            and Johnson (268) suggest that 6:27 (and the remaining portion of this
                            deleted passage), in particular, may have been reinstated to strengthen
                            the parallels between the Tharmas-Enion and Urizen-Ahania
                            stories.</note></p>
          <p>Of the three Enion passages, Blake circled two and left the other one
                        deleted. He retains most of Enion’s first lament,
                        “What have I done . . . accursed wretch! What deed . .
                        .” (5:46-57), but drops the last two lines. This passage is of
                        importance in returning the sympathetic and lamenting quality to Enion. It
                        establishes her realization of error that drives her “outward to
                        a world of woe” (5:54) where she wanders throughout the course of
                        the poem. Also, a modified form of the passage at the top of page 7 is
                        retained in part as a continuation of the circled passage at the bottom of
                        page 6 (Tharmas’ assertion of godhood over Enion).
                        “The final text at the top of page 7,” argues Lincoln,
                        “. . . should probably include lines 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, &amp;
                            11.”<ref target="n71" type="note">25</ref> This passage
                        expands on the sense of realization within Enion about the murder of
                        Tharmas’ Emanations and adds a heightened pathos to her character
                        with her realization “now I find that all those Emanations were
                        my Childrens Souls / And I have murderd them with cruelty above
                        atonement” (7.5-6). The depth of pathos here puts her
                        characterization quite in line with that of her other laments at 17:2-18:7
                        and 35:1-36:13, and her sense of murder without atonement gives an added
                        explanation for the fact that she never answers to Tharmas’ call
                        as she wanders in the “dark deep” (34:98). <note id="n71"><hi rend="s">25</hi> Lincoln, “<hi rend="i">The Four
                                Zoas</hi>” 95.</note></p>
          <p>This passage also strengthens Enion’s connection with her
                        mythological antecedent, Demeter, who wanders the earth in search of her
                        child Persephone.<ref target="n72" type="note">26</ref> Enion’s
                        larments show her wandering through a spiritual wasteland, lamenting for her
                        surviving children who flee from her “cruelty into the desarts /
                        Among wild beasts to roam” (7:7-8). Yet Blake goes beyond his
                        Greek sources to depict a mother who drives all love from her life and
                        thereby exiles her creative potential as represented by her offspring.
                        Indeed, her own self-absorption creates children who draw away her own life
                        and vitality. Blake, however, remains unwilling to condemn Enion
                        whole-heartedly. The one passage Blake did not circle to be reclaimed
                        (6:16-25) does not evoke the same degree of pathos as the two circled
                        passages nor does it contain any statement of self-realization or
                        repentance. Indeed, Enion seems to show less awareness in this than in the
                            <pb id="p22-100" n="100"/> previous speech. This deleted passage is
                        merely a lament in solitude and a call for Tharmas that does not really fill
                        out the narrative. In fact, some confusion seems to re-main in the setting,
                        since Enion first stands “on the Rocks” before
                        “her woven shadow glowing bright” (5:57), then hides
                        “in the darksom Cave” (6:15) and then sits
                        “among the Rocks” (6:22) and finally sleeps
                        “in a Chasm of the Valley” (6:24). I may perhaps be
                        seeking a greater degree of consistency here than Blake saw necessary;
                        however, because of the deletion of the material around this passage, it
                        does not seem that it could be easily refitted into the narrative at this
                        point. Yet just as importantly, Blake could not logically undermine
                        Enion’s laments at the ends of Nights I and II; she makes a
                        central statement about the actual effect of the fall in these laments that
                        is true not only for the world of the poem but also the failings in
                        contemporary British life that Blake attacked throughout his career. The
                        pathos in her laments represents the spirit of pathos shut out from the
                        sublime at the fall.<ref target="n73" type="note">27</ref><note id="n72"><hi rend="s">26</hi> Northrop Frye, <hi rend="i">Fearful

                            children, Los and Enitharmon, who draw life and vitality from their

                                see Tharmas and Enion’s relationship as an icon of the
                                situation represented by these lines and continued to revise it
                                accordingly in late stages of revising pages 4-7. Tharmas and Enion,
                                as the Sublime and the Pathos, are fixed and separated by virtue of
                                the Spectrous power emerging from mutual distrust and jealousy over
                                Tharmas’ relationship with Jerusalem.
                        </note></p>
          <p>Throughout this process of revision, however, we can see a tendency in
                        Blake’s writing, first, to fill out the symbolic and conceptual
                        elements in his character and then revise these elements to fit the
                        character they apply to. Thus, he works out the Spectre-like aspect of
                        Tharmas to its fullest and then attempts to revise it in this case to limit
                        the singular evil that the Tharmas character seems to take on. With Enion,
                        Blake shifts the degree and expression of her pathos in relation to the
                        ferocity of Tharmas. The result of such a process of revision seems to bring
                        a balance between the two characters. Of course, the fact that Blake revised
                        the opening of Night I long after he had already written most of the poem
                        also means that he had to consider whether he should accommodate his
                        revisions to make later appearances of Tharmas consistent. It is not clear
                        whether he was wholly committed to abandoning the consistency necessary to
                        the relatively linear narrative of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> in favor
                        of a more nonlinear form such as that used in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi></p>

          <p>Although Blake worked extensively with the Tharmas-Enion story in Night I, I
                        suspect that this painstaking work eventually contributed to his abandonment
                        of the manuscript. It seems that Tharmas’ significance began to
                        outstrip his role as one of the Four Zoas. Even as Blake elaborates on the
                        identity of Tharmas, he develops him beyond the immediate needs of the
                        narrative. In the poem’s narrative, he stands at the nodal point
                        of the fall into the chaotic sea of time and space and acts as a source for
                        the conditions of fallen existence. Enion’s weaving of Tharmas
                        into the Circle of Destiny and the form of the Spectre suggests that
                        Tharmas’ fall introduces fate and error. The weaving imagery also
                        suggests Tharmas’ incarnation into the limitations of the
                        physical body, while the notion that he holds the Emanation Jerusalem within
                        suggests the potential for redemption of the body when it contains the City
                        of God. These associations suggest that Tharmas is analogous to the
                        universal human form of the One Man, Jesus Christ. Such associations give
                        Tharmas a symbolic equivalence with Albion. Indeed, as he developed the
                        Tharmas character more fully, while, at the same time, working on <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Blake may have begun to transfer some of his
                        characteristics to Albion. In the design on plate 25 of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Albion’s fibers, like Tharmas’,
                        are drawn out by female figures to create the vegetated world. Also,
                        Albion’s Spectre, like Tharmas’, emerges at the
                        opening of the poem and moves to the west—Tharmas’
                        dark domain (4:6)—where he remains “a black
                        Horror” (J. 5:68; E 148). The influence of these Spectres
                        symbolically overshadows events in their respective poems. Moreover, the
                        action of Tharmas’ hiding Jerusalem “in the Soft
                        recess of darkness &amp; silence” (4:13) from Enion may be
                        compared to Albion’s hiding of Jerusalem “in jealous
                        fears” (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 4:33; E 147) “From the
                        vision and fruition of the Holy-one” (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 4:17; E
                        146). In addition, lines addressed by Enion to Tharmas in <hi rend="i">The
                            Four Zoas</hi> (4:18-21) are transferred to <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                        where they are spoken by Vala to Albion (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 22:1, 10-12; E
                            167).<ref target="n74" type="note">28</ref> Of these lines, Paley
                        remarks that “Although it cannot be proved that the traffic goes
                        from <hi rend="i">FZ</hi> to <hi rend="i">J</hi> here, it seems as if Blake
                        were quarrying material from his nearly abandoned Zoas myth for the later
                        myth of Jerusalem and Albion.”<ref target="n75" type="note">29</ref> The suggestion that Tharmas became a model for
                        Blake’s development of Albion thus seems quite possible; the
                        outcome of such revision would render Tharmas a redundant character in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and explain his relative absence from that poem.

          <p>Yet the shifting portrayal of Tharmas, in particular, suggests that Blake
                        conceived of his characters’ significances as more fluid than
                        many critics have yet suggested. He seems more than willing to experiment
                        freely with a character in a particular episode. Indeed, in the case of
                        Tharmas, Blake seems to become obsessed with the scene before him, giving it
                        a greater immediacy by straining certain attributes to their limits. Under
                        this obsession, Blake relaxes concerns with narrative consistency <pb id="p22-101" n="101"/> (whatever value that term may have to a poet who
                        often undermines consistency) for the immediacy of effect. Yet with <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, Blake seems again to modify the immediacy
                        of a scene to fit with the consistency of the thematic whole. Blake perhaps
                        felt uncertain about how to resolve the tension emerging in the revisions to
                            <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> between a sequentially coherent and
                        consistent narrative structure—what Donald Ault has called the
                        “Newtonian” narrative—and a subversively
                        disjunctive and disruptive
                        narrative—“anti-Newtonian,” in
                        Ault’s terms.<ref target="n76" type="note">30</ref> The Newtonian
                        narrative is necessary in conveying a fixity of events which may be
                        understood and interpreted by the reader. Interpretation of such narrative,
                        however, involves a rational assemblage and comparison of events along a
                        temporally and spatially limited schema, but the anti-Newtonian narrative
                        offers expanded possibilities in educating the reader. The anti-Newtonian
                        narrative, with its lack of explicitness and interpretive closure,<ref target="n77" type="note">31</ref> exerts pressure on the reader, forcing
                        him to use his own imaginative vision to unify rather than assemble
                        potential meaning in the text. Blake found his answer to this tension in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> In reading <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, we find
                        that Blake seems to demonstrate that immediacy of scene is all; overall
                        effect seems derived from the imaginative unification of disparate parts.
                        Thus, meaning derives from an accretion of disjunctive parts rather than
                        from a linear narrative imposed by the consistencies of time and space. In
                            <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, Blake still seems to feel a certain
                        stress between sequential and disjunctive narratives and does yet not fully
                        abandon one for the other. Perhaps the stress between these two forces
                        caused additional delays in Blake’s work on the poem, and created
                        fractures in the framework of his epic that he found he could never
                        completely or satisfactorily repair. <note id="n76"><hi rend="s">30</hi>

          <p>This facsimile has been a surprising number of years in gestation, for it was
                        in effect commissioned by Sir Geoffrey Keynes (d. 1982) and Arnold Fawcus
                        (d. 1979) as a continuation of the Blake Trust series of facsimiles. For
                        unexplained reasons, “it fell to the Institute [<hi rend="i">of
                            Traditional Science</hi>] to take the work soon after its conception and
                        bring it to completion” (viii). The manuscript in the Fitzwilliam
                        Museum has never been reproduced in its entirety before;<ref target="n78" type="note">1</ref> it is the longest and most important piece of
                        writing by Blake which has been thus neglected. <note id="n78"><hi rend="s">1</hi> For that matter, it is not reproduced in its entirety now,
                            for the original consists of a booklet of 32 pages, of which the first
                            17 bear the text and the last one has a drawing on it. Only the first 17
                            pages and the last 1 are reproduced; the 12 blank pages are not
                            reproduced, and the work is therefore not, strictly speaking, a
                            facsimile. Much reduced photographs of the text-pages of the <hi rend="i">Island</hi> are reproduced in William Blake, <hi rend="i">En Ö På Månen</hi>, ed.
                            Göran Malmqvist (Uppsala, 1979) 133-149.</note></p>
          <p>The virtues of this edition are all conservative. The reproduction of the
                        manuscript is excellent—true size, on fine wove paper not unlike
                        Blake’s, in remarkably faithful color rather than in black and
                        white. The transcription builds carefully upon the accomplishments of its
                        predecessors and extends them a little, and the introduction (3-26) and
                        annotations (67-99) cull the best of what has been written about the <hi rend="i">Island in the Moon.</hi> These are great and worthy
                        virtues.</p>
          <p>Occasionally the repetitions of the discoveries of the past are somewhat
                        uncritical. Thus the character called “Aradobo, the dean of
                        Morocco” is <q> conjectured [<hi rend="i">by</hi> Erdman, pp.
                            507-8] to be one of the sons of William Edwards of Halifax, famous for
                            his Morocco bindings . . . . In 1784, James, thirty, and John,
                            twenty-eight, opened their bookshop at 102 Pall Mall, evidently
                            innovating the exhibition sale room, for which ‘Descriptive
                            Catalogues’ were issued. (72) </q><figure n="bb74.1.14.ms" id="bb74.1.ms.14" rend="db"/> James Edwards (1756-1816) was 27 or 28 (not
                        “thirty”) when he moved to London in 1784, and his
                        brother John (23 December 1758-1793) was 25 (not
                        “twenty-eight”). From the Edwards’s
                        bookshops at 102 Pall Mall (1784-93) and 77 Pall Mall (1793-1800), shop
                        catalogues of antiquarian books were issued in January 1785, May 1787, 1789,
                        1790, 1794, and 1796, and they were called either merely <hi rend="i">A
                            Catalogue</hi> (1787, 1789, 1794, 1796) or <hi rend="i">Edwards’s Catalogue</hi> (1785, 1790) and never
                        “Descriptive Catalogue” (like Blake’s <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> of 1809). And there seems to be no
                        evidence at all that any of the Edwardses had an “exhibition sale
                        room” in London, <pb id="p22-104" n="104"/> as did their great
                        rivals in illustrated-book publishing John Boydell, Thomas Macklin, and
                        Robert Bowyer.</p>
          <p>More important, the branches of the firm of Edwards of Halifax were indeed
                        famous for bindings, but their fame was not based upon morocco bindings. The
                        three styles of bookcover decoration for which the Edwardses of Halifax were
                        particularly known were: (1) their patented method of painting under
                        transparent vellum on the covers; (2) “Etruscan calf,”
                        with designs stained with acid (not gilt) on the boards in imitation ofs
                        Etruscan vase paintings; (3) the fore-edges painted so that, when the leaves
                        are fanned, a scene appears where the closed book shows only gilt or marbled
                        edges. These three techniques were originated or renewed by the Edwardses of
                        Halifax, and these are the ones remarked by contemporaries such as Horace
                        Walpole, Mrs. Piozzi, and T. H. Horne (<hi rend="i">An Introduction to the
                            Study of Bibliography</hi> [1814], I, 309). Of course, as professional
                        bookbinders, they must have commissioned bindings in many materials, such as
                        calf, vellum, goat (morocco), and sheep, but their fame was not particularly
                        associated with morocco bindings, and today it may not be possible to
                        identify any individual examples of a morocco binding as their work.</p>
          <p>In short, if Aradobo, the dean of Morocco, is a bookbinder, there is no
                        particular reason to identify him with any of the Edwardses of Halifax
                        because of either their famous styles of binding or their known association
                        with Blake at the time his <hi rend="i">Island in the Moon</hi> was written
                        (? 1784).</p>
          <p>The “Description” of the manuscript itself is brief,
                        one paragraph on page 3, and somewhat strange. The watermark is not
                        identified (fleur de lis with a shield and GR countermark), and there is no
                        notice of the fact that the last leaf was sewn in separately, thus obscuring
                        its relationship with the rest of the leaves. (Indeed, we are told that
                        “The leaves are no longer conjugate, having at an early stage
                        been mounted on guards for binding” [3], but this is not noted in
                        Keynes’s <hi rend="i">Bibliography</hi> [1921] or in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> [1977], and one wonders what the evidence is for this
                        “early stage.”) There is no reference to the five
                        other leaves with which the <hi rend="i">Island</hi> was bound or to the
                        proofs of the Virgil woodcuts with them or to A. H. Palmer’s
                        statement about the provenance of the proofs. And it concludes
                        “that the extant manuscript is complete, but lacking the missing
                        sheet or sheets” after page 16 with an unknown amount of text.
                        This seems to be an odd use of “complete” when the
                        manuscript lacks an undefined amount of text. The <hi rend="i">Island</hi>
                        would have distressed Aristotle because it seems to have a beginning and an
                        end but no middle.</p>
          <p>The notes to the transcription scrupulously compare the readings of Erdman
                            (<hi rend="i">Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi> [1982])
                        and Bentley (<hi rend="i">William Blake’s Writings</hi> [1978])
                        with those given here, and, as an interested party, I have kept score as to
                        who seems to be correct: <table rows="2" cols="4"><row><cell>Phillips</cell><cell>Erdman</cell><cell>Bentley</cell><cell>None of the Former</cell></row><row><cell>34</cell><cell>18</cell><cell>21</cell><cell>6</cell></row></table> In general, both Phillips and Erdman read deletions more
                        confidently than I do—and most of these uncertainties are in
                        deleted passages. Then there are half a dozen points at which the truth
                        seems to be slightly different from what any of these worthies has printed,
                        though the extent and significance of the disputed passages is generally not
                        very great. Thus in chapter 5, line 3, we find: <table rows="2" cols="2"><row><cell><hi rend="i">Erdman, Bentley:</hi></cell><cell>Is Chatterton a Mathematician</cell></row><row><cell><hi rend="i">Phillips:</hi></cell><cell>Is Chatterton a Mathematicum</cell></row></table> The disputed word does indeed look more like
                        “Mathematicum” than
                        “Mathematician”—but it looks more like
                        “Mathematicune” than either. Unfortunately, neither
                        “Mathematicum” nor
                        “Mathematicune” seems to make sense—neither
                        is in the <hi rend="i">Oxford English Dictionary.</hi> Perhaps it would be
                        best to give “Mathematicum[?]” here. In many small
                        particulars Michael Phillips has improved the readings of the <hi rend="i">Island</hi>, and this is useful labor.</p>
          <p>The annotations incorporate the best work of his predecessors and
                        occasionally extend it as well. I do not remember seeing the operatic
                        passage concluding: “And the Cellar goes down with a Step (Grand
                        Chorus)” (ch. 9, 1. 16) compared before to Shadwell’s
                        play <hi rend="i">The Virtuoso</hi> (1676) and Dryden’s poem <hi rend="i">Mac Flecknoe</hi> (c. 1678) in which the protagonist-buffoon,
                        instead of being translated to heaven, “drops to the cellar
                        through a trapdoor.” I’m not sure the analogy is a
                        necessary one, but it has the virtue of making sense of a very puzzling
                        passage. And the account of Steelyard the Lawgiver sitting at his table
                        taking extracts in chapter 8 is usefully identified as “A
                        burlesque of the opening of Act V, Scene i, of Joseph Addison’s
                        tragedy <hi rend="i">Cato</hi> (1713, pp. 56-7): ‘Cato solus, <hi rend="i">sitting in a thoughtful Posture: In his Hand</hi>
                        Plato’s <hi rend="i">Book on the Immortality of the
                        Soul</hi>,’ ” for Addison’s <hi rend="i">Cato</hi> is later quoted in Blake’s manuscript. The song of
                        innocence beginning “O father father where are you
                        going” is connected intriguingly with the fact that
                        “Blake’s father died July 1784” (74, 80),
                        for the <hi rend="i">Island</hi> is generally taken to have been written
                        about 1784 or early <pb id="p22-105" n="105"/> 1785. Michael Phillips argues
                        that the MS is a fair copy with revisions “composed
                        intermittently between 1782 and 1785, or perhaps even later” (6),
                        but the evidence for a date before 1784 is not very persuasive. Indeed, even
                        the conventional date of 1784 is not very firm. The claims for novel
                        conclusions here are put with appropriate caution, and, while some scholars
                        may not accept all the conclusions which Michael Phillips presents, at least
                        the evidence is laid out plainly.</p>
          <p>In sum, this is a satisfactorily faithful reproduction of the manuscript, the
                        transcription, introduction, and notes are just what they should be and what
                        they pretend to be, and the whole is a genuine contribution to Blake
                        scholarship. Anyone concerned to know the appearance and implications of
                        Blake’s puzzling manuscript of <hi rend="i">An Island in the
                            Moon</hi> can in future turn with confidence to this careful and
                        valuable edition. [See Michael Phillips’s comment, below]</p>

          <p>It is a long time since I have received one of these wonderful William Blake Trust
            publications. The excitement of unwrapping a package large enough to enclose a complete
            set of hi-fi equipment, the characteristic smell of glue and leather, the sumptuous
            effect of gold tooling on brown leather with carefully attuned cloth and marbled papers,
            beautifully clear and legible typeface—I had feared that these were a thing of the past.
            And of course, in many ways this publication is a product of the past. The “onlie
            begetters,” Sir Geoffrey Keynes and Arnold Fawcus, died in 1982 and 1979 respectively,
            leaving the work unfinished, and a new team, David Bindman, Barbara Bryant, Robert
            Essick and Bo Lindberg, some already involved in the project, have brought the work to
            completion. The result is something rather different from, and rather more ambitious
            than, what was originally envisaged. The long list of color facsimiles produced by the
            Trianon Press under Arnold Fawcus for the William Blake Trust were above all objects of
            beauty, recreating as near to perfection as possible Blake’s original achievements. The
            accompanying text, though fully adequate, was deliberately kept as short as possible.
            Only in a few of the later publications, such as <hi rend="i">Blake’s Laocoön, a Last
              Testament</hi>, published in 1976, and <hi rend="i">The Complete Portraiture of
              William and Catherine Blake</hi>, of 1977, was the accompanying matter of necessity
            fuller and more scholarly. Now, as the preface by David Bindman <pb id="p22-106" n="106"/><figure n="bb421.1.2-1.ps" id="bb421.1.spb.02" rend="db"/> and John Commander states, “a more
            extensive range of discussion, analysis and documentation” has been included. From the
            simplicity of the original idea this publication has become a multipart, complex
            production including not only the visual evidence, but also a profusion of analysis and
            description. For the scholar this has obvious advantages, but it also has two major
            disadvantages, particularly for the primary market for this publication, the Blake
            enthusiast.</p>
          <p>First, there is no consistency of opinion throughout the publication; different
            theories as to order of execution and so on are put forward by the different authors.
            The preface somewhat disingenuously suggests that “this partly reflects the many-layered
            complexity of Blake’s involvement with the <hi rend="i">Job</hi> theme and is also an
            acknowledgement that the range and depth of Blake studies can no longer be embraced by
            one scholar.” The problem is at its greatest in connection with Keynes’s introductory
            text on “The Development of the Job Designs.” This was written some years before
            Keynes’s death and indeed the main substance dates back to the great five-part
            publication of <hi rend="i">Illustrations to the Book of</hi><figure/><hi rend="i">Job
              by William Blake</hi> edited by Keynes and Laurence Binyon in 1935, and subsequently
            republished with emendments in <hi rend="i">Blake Studies</hi> in 1971. The editors were
            faced with a difficult decision and in the end, “It was decided not to attempt to bring
            the text up to date but to leave it essentially unchanged. A few minor editorial
            alterations have been made . . . .” However, this has left not only contradictions
            between Keynes’s text and what is written elsewhere in the publication but even
            contradictions within Keynes’s text itself. On page 18, the date of the first, Thomas
            Butts set of watercolors, is brought back from the 1820s to the first decade of the
            nineteenth century but the subsequent text is left largely unaltered, leaving Keynes to
            suggest at the head of page 19 that, after a few early isolated depictions of subjects
            from the Book of Job, Blake did not set about “telling the story in his own way . . . .
            in the series of ‘Inventions’ until after his second spiritual rebirth following the
            dark days of 1810-18.” On the other hand, it is not just for sentimental and nostalgic
            reasons that one is glad that Keynes’s piece has been retained. There is a
            characteristic lightness of touch and sense of humor largely lacking from the writings
            of later writers on Blake, as in the juxtaposition <pb id="p22-107" n="107"/> of the
            transcription of the entries recording the sale of proofs to the King and to Josiah
            Taylor, the latter having been “sent to the House of Correction by F. Tatham, Taylor
            being S<hi rend="s">t</hi> [sent] H. of C. for swindling.”</p>
          <p>Much the most crucial result of the decision to submit the whole question of Blake’s
            illustrations to the Book of Job to a thorough scholarly review is that it has proved
            impossible to suppress the doubts concerning the genuineness of the works that had
            already been printed in expensive color facsimile by the Trianon Press before Fawcus’s
            death, the so-called New Zealand set, the Collins hand colored engravings, and the four
            hand colored plates in the Fitzwilliam Museum. By the time he died, Keynes must have
            been the only reputable Blake scholar still to insist on the authenticity of the New
            Zealand set; even Fawcus, who had previously been persuaded that they were genuine, had
            begun to have his doubts, which were later reinforced by his widow’s researches. Other
            scholars had doubted them long before. The result is that this fine but expensive
            publication is largely taken up with what at the best can only be regarded as peripheral
            material, together with a scholarly apparatus that demonstrates just how peripheral it
            is. In fact the scholarly apparatus is perhaps almost too damning in its judgement on at
            least one group of the works.</p>
          <p>To make things easier for the impecunious the Blake Trust has made 50 copies of the two
            main parts of this publication (each in its own box) available separately; however, the
            22 deluxe copies and 250 of the standard copies can only be acquired both parts
            together. Nevertheless it will perhaps be helpful if this review continues with a
            discussion of the contents of the publication section by section so that people wanting
            to buy only one part will know what is involved.</p>
          <p>The first box, devoted to <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Illustrations to the Book of
              Job</hi>, contains two sections, one a book of most of the introductory texts, the
            other a box filled with a series of 22 fascicules each devoted to the various treatments
            of one composition in the series. The text volume starts with a select bibliography
            which also serves as a list of abbreviations, a page of acknowledgements written by
            Stephen Keynes, and a foreword, discussing the activities of the William Blake Trust, by
            Charles Ryskamp. This is followed by the preface by Bindman and Commander, already
            mentioned, which discusses and explains the complicated evolution of the publication.
            Then follows Keynes’s essay on “The Development of the Job Designs.”</p>
          <p>The rest of this introductory text volume is required reading for the Blake scholar. It
            begins with an essay on “The Book of Job Designs from Butts series to final engravings”
            by Bindman, which discusses the evolution of the various series of illustrations and
            relates them to the evolution of Blake’s thought. He starts by establishing the present
            view that the first set of watercolor illustrations for the Book of Job, those executed
            for Thomas Butts, were mainly done in the first decade of the nineteenth century rather
            than at the beginning of the 1820s, and that two of the series are later additions. One
            small addition can be made to his account of the stages by which this new dating was
            reached: in the 1971 second edition of my 1957 catalogue of the works by Blake in the
            Tate Gallery I had already suggested (see page 63) a dating of c. 1810. More important
            than the question of precedence however is the fact that Bindman makes sense of the
            redating in the context of Blake’s changing opinions as between the first decade of the
            century and the Indian summer of Blake’s last years. He also throws in the interesting
            speculation that the watercolor illustrations to the Bible, which seem to have
            immediately preceded the first series of illustrations to the Book of Job, were designed
            for an extra-illustrated volume. However, my own view is that the Bible watercolors,
            with their large inscriptions in a copperplate hand, were designed for display; the
            badly faded condition of many of these shows that they were so displayed and suffered
            from the ruinous effect of daylight.</p>
          <p>Bindman’s essay is followed by Essick’s on “Blake’s Engravings to the Book of Job: An
            Essay of their Graphic Form with a Catalogue of their States and Printings.” This is as
            detailed and exhaustive as one would expect and includes a lot of new material
            including, for instance, the fact that glue spots on the reduced size drawings in the
            Fitzwilliam Museum show that they were actually stuck to the copperplates as an aid to
            their engraving. Again the factual examination of the evidence, in this case Blake’s
            actual technique, is related to the wider issue of his artistic philosophy. Reading
            Essick’s analysis of the difference between the various states of the engravings is
            laborious, but well worthwhile in that it gives an insight into Blake’s working methods
            and attention to “minute particulars.” One slight disadvantage is that the various sets
            of pre-publication proofs are not discussed in chronological order but by location,
            which makes it difficult to follow the progression through from one series of proofs to
            the next. However a hitherto unknown set of proofs in the University of Texas library is
            included and, most fascinating of all, there is an analysis, as full as the
            circumstances allow, of a set of proofs that was last recorded when sold in 1936 (this
            has already formed the subject of an article in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 19 (1985-6):
            96-102). These last include evidence, not fully taken into account elsewhere in this
            publication, that even at this late stage Blake did not regard Job’s act of worship in
            the first design as merely an act of uninspired conformity, an inscription in the margin
            at the <pb id="p22-108" n="108"/> foot of the altar reading “Prayer to God is the Study
            of Imaginative Art.” Only the fact that this set of proofs has now disappeared can
            account for the relative calm that has followed the publication of this revolutionary
            piece of information.</p>
          <p>The final section of this first volume of text is that on “The Job designs; a
            Documentary and Bibliographical Record,” compiled by Bryant with introductory notes by
            Bindman. This sets out all the Linnell accounts that relate to the publication of Job
            illustrations and includes fascinating short biographical notes on nearly every figure
            mentioned. These are especially full on lesser known figures and are made readily
            accessible through an index at the end. Only in amazingly few cases have the authors had
            to admit total failure in discovering anything about their subject. One small correction
            must be made: at the top of page 104 it is stated that three watercolors from the John
            Linnell set are not in the Fogg Art Museum; in fact one is in the National Gallery of
            Art, Washington, one is in a private collection in Paris, but the third, although parted
            at one stage from the rest of the Fogg Museum set when it passed through the collection
            of A. E. Newton, has now rejoined that set (Butlin no. 551 <hi rend="i">14</hi>).</p>
          <p>In addition to the introductory volume of text, the first of these two joint
            publications contains a box of fascicules each containing monochrome reproductions of
            the various stages in the evolution of each composition in the series: the Butts
            watercolor, the John Linnell watercolor, the reduced-size Fitzwilliam Museum drawings
            and the final engraving, together with some of the related tempera paintings,
            watercolors or drawings, some proof engravings including all those with marginal
            sketches, and the corresponding composition from the New Zealand set of watercolors.
            There is an introductory folder containing “The Meaning of Blake’s Job” by Lindberg, and
            each fascicule bears on the front of each folder a plate by plate commentary together
            with notes on previous interpretations by such writers as Wicksteed and S. Foster Damon.
            This commentary does not, perhaps thankfully, go into great interpretive detail but is
            more of a basic introduction of the kind found in earlier Blake Trust publications.</p>
          <p>However, the long evolution of this publication has led to certain problems. In the
            first place Essick’s researches have produced rather more states for some of the prints
            than were known when these fascicules were printed in the 1970s. The new information is
            available, but only in Essick’s catalogue. The short list of contents on the inside of
            the enclosing page of each fascicule, printed at the same time as the rest, gives the
            earlier, incorrect information. Certain additional reproductions have been made since
            the first printing, and these are listed on the back of the introductory folder, but
            again not at the front of the appropriate fascicule.</p>
          <p>More seriously, certain related works are omitted both from this collection of
            reproductions and indeed, so far as I can discover, from the text as a whole. The
            tempera painting related to plate 20, <hi rend="i">Job and his Daughters</hi> in the
            National Gallery of Art, Washington, is reproduced and mentioned in the text with the
            correct date of c. 1799-1800 (thus correcting the dating in the 1820s of William
            Rossetti and of Lindberg in his pioneering book on <hi rend="i">The Illustrations for
              the Book of Job</hi>, 1973). However, there is no mention at all, let alone a
            reproduction, of the Tate Gallery’s tempera on panel of <hi rend="i">Satan smiting Job
              with sore Boils</hi>, surely the final summation of that composition. Similarly, of
            the three pencil and watercolor sketches that play an important part in the evolution of
            certain of the later versions of the composition (Butlin nos. 552, 553 and 556), that
            showing <hi rend="i">Job’s Sacrifice</hi> in the City Art Gallery, Leeds, is mentioned
            but not reproduced (though there is an acknowledgement for permission to reproduce to
            the Leeds City Art Gallery). Only the recto of <hi rend="i">Every Man also gave him a
              piece of Money</hi>, a version of the upright variant of the composition, and now in
            the Tate Gallery, is reproduced, but not the recently discovered drawing on the reverse.
            This means that this collection of reproductions, in some ways the most useful part of
            the whole publication, is maddeningly incomplete; one still has to refer to other
            publications for certain works essential to the evolution of Blake’s designs.</p>
          <p>The second of these two joint publications, devoted to <hi rend="i">Colour versions of
              William Blake’s Book of Job designs from the circle of John Linnell</hi>, consists of
            a large box containing a seventeen-page introduction by Lindberg on “The Authenticity of
            the New Zealand Set and of the Colour Engravings; Comparisons between the sets,”
            together with the three sets of color facsimiles that were the original <hi rend="i">raison d’etre</hi> of this publication: the socalled New Zealand set of watercolors,
            the size of the engravings though without the margins, including all the compositions
            together with the title page; the so-called Collins set of hand colored engravings, the
            complete set with title page; and the four hand colored engravings, of compositions 11,
            15, 18 and 20, in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. These facsimiles are of the highest
            quality, hand colored through stencils by the pochoir process.</p>
          <p>Lindberg’s introduction is, to put it bluntly, a detailed and, in all but one case
            perhaps, a convincing demolition job on the authenticity of all three sets of works. In
            the case of the New Zealand set some of his arguments have been given before, as in his
            own 1973 publication on the Job illustrations; some are new and include observations
            made independently by Fawcus’s widow Julie. Lindberg kindly acknowledges my
            contribution, which I can confirm was also arrived at independently. <pb id="p22-109" n="109"/> Once again, to put the record straight, I should perhaps point out that my
            suspicions were voiced, if only by omission, in the second edition of my catalogue of
            the works by Blake in the Tate Gallery: in the first edition I had mentioned the New
            Zealand set among the authentic works of Blake, while in the second I omitted all
            reference to it. To sum up the arguments, in every case the New Zealand watercolors
            depend either upon the final state of engravings where these have been altered or, where
            they differ from the final state of the engravings, upon the John Linnell set of
            watercolors. There is no way in which they can be regarded as independent works by Blake
            himself, whereas Lindberg convincingly places them within the circle of John Linnell and
            his sons and pupils whom Linnell is known to have instructed by having them copy works
            by Blake.</p>
          <p>For the two sets of hand colored engravings the arguments are less technical and more
            based on the judgement of the eye. The coloring of both sets is closely related to that
            of the New Zealand set, as is convincingly demonstrated by Lindberg. Moreover, the hand
            colored engravings and the New Zealand set are closer to each other than they are to the
            Linnell set of watercolors. One technical argument against the authenticity of the hand
            colored engravings, like that of the New Zealand set, is that the coloring of Job’s
            three friends is wrong in compositions 15 and 18, but this argument is somewhat vitiated
            by the fact that Blake himself seems to have made a similar mistake in composition
            16.</p>
          <p>The very quality of the color facsimiles makes this reviewer doubt the almost
            overwhelming evidence produced by Lindberg, at least in the case of the four Fitzwilliam
            Museum prints. It is not really correct to say, as Lindberg does, that the coloring in
            plate 11 is paler because the work has faded, though this argument does perhaps apply in
            the case of plate 18. In each case, to my eye, the coloring of the Fitzwilliam Museum
            version is more sensitive than that in either the Collins set or the New Zealand series
            of watercolors. Given that it is at least arguable that in other cases of hand colored
            engravings of Blake compositions, for instance the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>,
            there is at least one prime original hand colored by Blake himself, from which his wife
            or whoever made subsequent hand colored copies, it strikes me that the Fitzwilliam
            Museum prints could represent either the compositions surviving from a complete set or
            an incomplete set begun by Blake himself.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately there is no provenance for the Fitzwilliam Museum engravings prior to
            1935. That of the Collins engravings can be traced back to the middle of the nineteenth
            century and Lindberg has been able to supply new information about the history of the
            New Zealand set, two watercolors from which, it has been discovered, were exhibited at
            the Auckland Society of Arts in 1881 as being by William Blake. This attribution is
            clearly not enough in itself to authenticate the works. Lindberg dismisses another
            argument for the authenticity of the Collins set of hand colored engravings, that the
            monochrome engraving itself was deliberately printed paler to make the coloring more
            effective: as Linnell seems to have been responsible for much of the early printing, it
            could have been his intention that the works should be colored, or indeed, if I am
            correct in assuming that Blake himself was responsible for the Fitzwilliam Museum
            coloring, Blake himself could have intended the coloring but not actually executed
            it.</p>
          <p>Only in one further, minor point would I wish to disagree with Lindberg’s most thorough
            analysis of the various problems connected with Blake’s illustrations to the Book of
            Job. Lindberg suggests that the two compositions added to the Thomas Butts set of
            watercolors, clearly in the 1820s, were done before the corresponding compositions in
            the John Linnell set; Bindman and myself hold that they were executed subsequent to the
            Linnell watercolors. In the case of composition 17, <hi rend="i">The Vision of
              Christ</hi>, Lindberg argues that the position of the three friends, facing the vision
            of Christ in the Butts watercolor, is reversed in all the other versions and that this
            reversal is subtler in effect, particularly in the final engraving. However it could
            well be that Blake, or perhaps his widow who may have finished at least the coloring of
            this watercolor, wanted to give Butts, an old patron, something rather different from
            what had been done for the much younger patron John Linnell. In the case of <hi rend="i">Job and his Daughters</hi>, composition 20, the two preliminary sketches (and
            significantly there are more such sketches for this composition than for most of the
            others) and the Linnell watercolor show Blake undecided as between setting his figures
            in a landscape or in an interior. In the final engraving he reverted to the solution of
            some 25 years earlier, the composition of the biblical tempera painting now in the
            National Gallery of Art, Washington. Rather than see the Butts watercolor as a stage in
            the evolution from a landscape setting towards an interior setting, I would suggest that
            the landscape solution of the Butts watercolor could again be a deliberate effort to
            distinguish his watercolor from the composition as evolved for John Linnell.</p>
          <p>It is because of the excellence of the reproductions and the thoroughness of the
            scholarship, that one can argue over such detailed points. Access to the Collins set of
            hand colored engravings is not easy but I have been fortunate enough to see them in the
            past (and even more fortunate in being able to examine the Fitzwilliam Museum prints
            laid out on my own grand piano!). But the quality of the facsimiles, even unaided by
            memories of the originals, is so high that value judgments can be made to supplement the
            detailed arguments of the text. Whether the effort and expense is worth it one must
            leave to the customer. For the scholar of Blake’s work in <pb id="p22-110" n="110"/> the
            visual arts, both publications will be essential. For somebody willing to be satisfied
            with the main core of Blake’s achievement perhaps the first of the two publications will
            be sufficient, particularly if one has access to the 1935 Pierpont Morgan Library
            publication, which contains color facsimiles of the Butts and Linnell set of watercolors
            (only reproduced here in monochrome), and indeed of the New Zealand set, together with
            reproductions of the Fitzwilliam Museum drawings, many of the related sketches, and the
            final engravings.</p>

          <p>G. E. Bentley, Jr., has generously invited my comment on his review of the
                        facsimile of William Blake’s <hi rend="i">An Island in the
                            Moon.</hi> The only aspect where I feel that it may be appropriate for
                        me to do so is in answer to the questions he raises regarding the
                        “Description” of the manuscript, as these questions
                        may lead some readers to conclude that the edition may not present all of
                        the material that it should, or that what has been presented may not be
                        faithfully described.</p>
          <p>A misunderstanding appears to stem from reference to the binding of the
                        manuscript and to knowledge of its history prior to 1978. At the time of
                        Keynes’s inspection, and later that of Bentley, the manuscript
                        was bound together with leaves of later Van Gelder paper, upon which were
                        mounted a proofsheet of Blake’s woodcuts for
                        Thornton’s <hi rend="i">Pastorals of Virgil</hi> (1821) and a
                        note referring to their provenance by Samuel Palmer’s son, A. H.
                        Palmer. In 1978 it was disbound for restoration and rebinding by the late S.
                        M. Cockerell. As the old binding was removed Cockerell made the following
                        description of its condition and contents and of the processes of rebinding: <q><hi rend="i">Note by Binder</hi>; DC6477; Island in the Moon; William
                            Blake. Condition when received: Binding red hard grain, title blocked in
                            gold on front board, leaves overcast very close to the text and the book
                            sewn on five sawn cords, slips cut off. Collation—paste down
                            and three blank leaves at front, paste down and one blank leaf at the
                            back all Van Gelder paper plus six blank leaves at the back of the same
                            thin paper as the manuscript; the third blank leaf numbered 1, two A. H.
                            Palmer notes mounted on leaf 2, wood engraving mounted on leaf 3, text
                            on leaves 4 to 12, drawings on the verso of leaf 13, leaves 2 and 3
                            foxed.<lb/><lb/> Leaves disbound, overcasting removed, acidity of paper
                            checked, average reading pH 4.12, leaves deacidified with a solution of
                            Barium Hydroxide in Methanol, reading after treatment pH5.30, the Palmer
                            notes and the wood engraving remounted on handmade paper, leaves edged
                            with handmade paper using heatset tissue and mounted in handmade paper
                            frames, each mounted leaf bound separately in quarter brown morocco,
                            buckram sides, gold lettering, the blank leaves in one binding, the
                            thirteen bindings housed in three buckram covered boxes. (Solvent for
                            the adhesive of heatset tissue—I. M. S.) [Signed] SMC; D. C.
                            and Son November 1978 </q> It was after rebinding, and while the
                        manuscript was being photographed for the color facsimile, that it was first
                        inspected for the edition.</p>
          <p>As Cockerell’s description suggests, the manuscript leaves were
                        not conjugate. It had been bound as separate folio leaves in the order
                        given, with the leaf of sketches bound out of order, before the six blank
                        leaves. The narrow inside margins of each of these leaves, of thin and quite
                        brittle paper, showed evidence of being broken, and at the time, I
                        understood this condition to indicate that each leaf had previously been
                        mounted on a guard for binding.<ref target="n79" type="note">1</ref>
                        Cockerell’s description, “leaves overcast very close
                        to the text,” indicates that in fact each leaf had only been
                            “overcast”<ref target="n80" type="note">2</ref>
                        and then sewn directly onto cords for binding. If any part of the manuscript
                        had been conjugate this would have been noted and the full sheet preserved.
                            <note id="n79"><hi rend="s">1</hi> “I saw Sandy Cockerell last
                            Thursday, and . . . asked him about the manuscript of <hi rend="i">An
                                Island in the Moon.</hi> . . . Sandy said that when they disbound
                            the volume in which the MS had been bound, they found all the pages were
                            separate, and had been joined together with guards—or so he
                            remembered. Certainly, he said, he would never have cut any bifoliate
                            leaf, though he would remove the guards, as they are often a cause of
                            damage.” Letter to the author, 23 June 1981, from Simon
                            Rendall, who was responsible for photographing the manuscript and with
                            whom I had discussed the condition of the separate leaves.</note><note id="n80"><hi rend="s">2</hi> “<hi rend="i">Overcasting</hi>,

          <p>The surviving sixteen leaves contain an equal number of watermarks and
                            countermarks.<ref target="n81" type="note">3</ref> In this sense the
                        extant manuscript is described as complete, in that what has survived
                        represents eight complete sheets of the original gathering, each sheet
                        containing a watermark and a countermark. However, in absolute terms, the
                        “Description” also makes plain that at least one sheet
                        is missing from the center of the gathering, indicated by the lacuna between
                        the surviving eighth and ninth leaves of an otherwise consecutive text.
                            <note id="n81"><hi rend="s">3</hi> See the diagram of watermarks and

          <p>There remains the question of the other contents of the volume, as disbound
                        by Cockerell. Understandably, Bentley associates these materials with the
                        manuscript as they were bound together at the time of his inspection, and
                        duly noted in <hi rend="i">Blake Books.</hi><ref target="n82" type="note">4</ref> As they bear upon the subject of the facsimile, a distinction
                        was made: foremost, that no <hi rend="i">intrinsic</hi> relationship exists
                        between the manuscript and the other materials that were at one time present
                        in the same binding. A consideration was the binding itself and its history.
                        Exactly when and for whom the binding was made could not be determined at
                        the time, and remains unknown. What was clear, from the nature of the
                        binding and its contents, was that the manuscript had only been placed
                        together with the other materials some time after Blake’s death.

          <p>The Fitzwilliam Museum has now been able to supply further information. The
                        binding was by the firm of Rivière &amp; Son; it contained
                        the bookplate “FROM THE LIBRARY OF / CH.FAIRFAX
                        MURRAY”; and it was in this binding that Charles Fairfax Murray
                        presented the volume to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905.<ref target="n83" type="note">5</ref> The firm of Rivière was started in Bath
                        in 1829, changed to Rivière &amp; Son in 1881, and ceased
                        business in 1939.<ref target="n84" type="note">6</ref> By 1893 the
                        manuscript belonged to Charles Fairfax Murray, as acknowledged by Ellis and
                        Yeats in their edition of Blake published that year. Their description does
                        not make clear whether the manuscript is bound.<ref target="n85" type="note">7</ref> Nor does that of John Sampson published in 1905, which is based
                        upon an inspection of the manuscript while it was still in Fairfax
                        Murray’s possession.<ref target="n86" type="note">8</ref> Neither
                        Ellis and Yeats, nor Sampson, make reference to the other materials. It
                        would seem likely therefore that these materials, including the manuscript,
                        were gathered together by Charles Fairfax Murray and bound for him by
                        Rivière &amp; Son, certainly not later than 1905 and
                        possibly, specifically for presentation to the Fitzwilliam Museum. <note id="n83"><hi rend="s">5</hi> I am grateful to Dr. Paul Woudhuysen, Keeper

          <p>I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding and assures those who may use the
                        edition. It should perhaps be added that it was for reasons of economy that
                        the six blank leaves which survive, and which were originally conjugate with
                        the leaves of Blake’s manuscript, were not reproduced in
                        facsimile. These leaves are clearly referred to in the
