            <hi rend="b">HANDLIST OF THE HUNTINGTON BLAKE COLLECTION</hi>
          </title>
        </head>
        <byline>BY <docAuthor>ROBERT N. <name>ESSICK</name></docAuthor></byline>
        <p>The Henry L. Huntington Library, Art Gallery, and Botanical Garden, San Marino, California, possesses one of the world’s great collections of works by William Blake and artists of his circle. The twenty-seven illustrations to three of Milton’s poems and the beautifully colored copy of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> form an unrivalled gathering of Blake’s poetic and pictorial responses to that poet. The Huntington has many other treasures throughout the full range of Blake’s endeavours as author and artist, including unique copies of <hi rend="i">All Religions are One</hi> and <hi rend="i">The French Revolution.</hi> This handlist covers all original works by Blake in all media, unique works closely related to him, and original works by eight artists—Flaxman, Fuseli, Romney, Stothard, Calvert, Linnell, Palmer, and Richmond—of Blake’s circle. The list does not include criticism, catalogues, facsimiles, and other reference materials in the Huntington, or the considerable holdings of artists (Mortimer, Barry, Basire, etc.) who influenced Blake.</p>
        <p>The most important Blakes in the Huntington were acquired in the first quarter of this century. Several of the illuminated books (<hi rend="i">Milton, Songs of Innocence</hi>), one of the two Huntington copies of <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi>, and some of the rarer commercial book illustrations (<hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads</hi>, 1802) came from the collection of Robert Hoe, auctioned in April 1911. In the same year, most of the <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> illustrations were acquired through the dealer Frank Sabin, who sold the <hi rend="i">Nativity Ode</hi> and <hi rend="i">Comus</hi> designs to Mr. Huntington in 1916. The acquisition of the Beverly Chew collection in December 1912 brought the complete copy of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> to the Huntington. G. D. Smith, another dealer who worked closely with Mr. Huntington, acquired for him a copy of <hi rend="i">For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise</hi> in 1914 (T. G. Arthur auction) and <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> in 1918 (Herschel V. Jones auction). The famous A. S. W. Rosenbach provided several works, including <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel.</hi> The Linnell auction of March 1918 offered the opportunity to acquire a number of unique works—<hi rend="i">The Hiding of Moses, All Religions are One, The French Revolution</hi>, sixteen letters, and the <hi rend="i">Genesis Manuscript.</hi> The beautifully color-printed <hi rend="i">Song of Los</hi> was added in 1915 from the Frederic Robert Halsey collection. The Huntington has continued to add materials since these important acquisitions, particularly volumes with Blake’s commercial book illustrations, but it is unlikely that major works will be acquired in the near future.</p>
        <p>The Blake materials are housed in two buildings at the Huntington. Drawings, paintings, and the color printed impression of <hi rend="i">Albion Rose</hi> are kept in the Art Gallery, formerly Mr. Huntington’s residence. All writings and the remainder of the graphic works, plus <hi rend="i">Hecate</hi>, are housed in the Library building. Most of the Library materials, and the books in the Art Gallery, have a "call number," given here as a sequence of numbers (or numbers and letters) within parentheses at the end of each entry. Materials listed here without call number or note on special location are housed in the Art Gallery. Dimensions in centimeters are given for all drawings, height followed by width. Entry numbers and other references are explained at the beginning of each section.</p>
        <p>The Huntington collection is open to qualified scholars and graduate students. Inquiries should be addressed to Readers’ Service, Huntington Library, San Marino, California 91108.</p>
        <p>The Huntington staff, ever kind and efficient, has been most helpful in compiling this list. I wish particulary to thank James Thorpe, Robert Wark, Daniel Woodward, Carey Bliss, William Landon, and Mary Lou DeLapp.</p>

The heavy, careless brushstrokes, indefinite outlines, and chiaroscuro effects are totally unlike any work by Blake, including his other known early effors such as the drawings for Gough’s <hi rend="i">Sepulchral Monuments</hi> of c. 1774-79, the drawings of the opening of the tomb of Edward I in 1774, the drawings for <hi rend="i">Vetusta Monumenta</hi> of 1775, and the various history of Britain compositions of 1779-80. Blake’s early drawings of nudes—one of a studio model (1779?) and another showing the back and legs of a heavily muscled man (repro. Keynes, <hi rend="i">Drawings</hi>, 1927, pl. 3; Blunt, <hi rend="i">Art of Blake</hi>, fig. 3b)—are careful compositions in pencil with hatching patterns which reveal Blake’s training as an engraver and his study of Renaissance prints. This oil painting shows none of these major influences on the young apprentice—indeed, it is antithetical to them. The large signature on the painting is suspiciously similar to that on several works not by Blake, including those noted in VIII, A, 3. The anatomical similarities between the figure in this painting and Blake’s engraving of 1773 he later entitled "Joseph of Arimathea Among the Rocks of Albion" is explained by the fact that both are copies after Michelangelo.</note></p>

        <byline>BY <docAuthor>JANICE S. <name>LYLE</name></docAuthor></byline>
        <p>The Robert N. Essick collection, one of the more important Blake collections still in private hands, is the result of careful but avid acquisition since 1969. Probably the largest collection, public or private, of Blake’s commercial book illustrations, the Essick holdings also include Blake drawings, paintings, pages from the Illuminated Books, separate prints, and works by and after Blake’s contemporaries (Flaxman, Fuseli and Stothard) and followers (Calvert, Linnell, Palmer and Richmond). This is the range of work included in the checklist; excluded are original prints by and after artists of the preceding generation (Barry, Mortimer, and Runciman), which form an important part of the Essick collection, and the approximately 800-volume library of critical books, sale and exhibition catalogues, facsimiles, editions of Blake’s writings, books by and about Blake’s associates, and other types of support material. This collection and that of the Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery make Southern California a significant center for Blake scholarship.</p>
        <p>I wish to thank Professor Essick for giving so freely of his knowledge about these works, particularly concerning the states of the engraved plates. The meticulous research he conducted when purchasing these items minimized the problems of compiling this checklist.</p>

            <hi rend="b">HANDLISTS OF FOUR BLAKE COLLECTIONS</hi>
          </title>
        </head>
        <byline>BY <docAuthor>MORTON D. <name>PALEY</name></docAuthor> Assisted by <docAuthor>Michael <name>Davies</name></docAuthor></byline>
        <p>Work on these handlists was begun in 1972 with the cooperation of the institutions involved. In the course of preparing final copy, I have examined every Blake original in all four collections. I have not attempted to provide full catalogue information for each entry, as that is not the function of a handlist: the purpose of this material is to aid users and prospective users of the four collections. For the same reason, I have not thought it necessary to impose a strict uniformity of presentation, as the four museums vary somewhat in their modes of classifying material. However, in instances where an item has been catalogued by a museum under a title different from that normally used, I have given one or the other title in brackets.</p>
        <p>It is a pleasure to acknowledge the assistance I have received from members of the curatorial staffs of the museums involved, namely Miss Eunice Williams and Mrs. Margaret P. Morgan of the Fogg Museum; Dr. John J. McKendry, Mrs. Dwight E. Lee, and Miss Carolyn Joynes of the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Dr. C. Michael Kauffmann of the Victoria and Albert Museum; and Mrs. Karin Peltz of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. I am also grateful to Mrs. Foster Foreman and to Miss Betsy Bowden for research assistance; and to Miss Deirdre Toomey, Dr. David Bindman, and Professor Robert N. Essick for their valuable advice.</p>

          <p>The recent publication of <hi rend="i">Spiritus Mundi</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Secular Scripture</hi> occasions this review of Northrop Frye’s works since <hi rend="i">Fearful Symmetry.</hi> (A list of all books included in this review precedes the notes at the end.) Keeping in mind Frye’s own contention that his critical ideas have been "derived from Blake," I have tried to clarify his indebtedness to the poet who has provided him "the keys to poetic thought." Unlike other critics of Frye, I have discussed this indebtedness in the moral terms which he himself has used to explain his interest in Blake’s art. As a teacher and critic, Frye has never considered literature without defending its importance to life; he has valued Blake in particular for his service to "values and standards" that only the imagination can keep alive.</p>
          <p>Thinking about literature often originates in extra-literary value judgments. When twentieth-century critics like Pound and Eliot, for example, tried to consider "poetry primarily as poetry and not another thing," they did not forget their moral opposition to the English Romantic movement. To be sure, Pound and Eliot sympathized with the Romantic writers’ hostility to modern society, but they nevertheless deplored the destructive direction taken by Romantic social criticism. The Romantic poets, in Irving Babbitt’s analysis, remained "half-educated," unable to formulate a satisfying alternative to the values which they had rejected: "The half-educated man [Babbitt wrote in <hi rend="i">Rousseau and Romanticism</hi>] may be defined as the man who has acquired a degree of critical self-consciousness sufficient to detach him from the standards of his time and place, but not sufficient to acquire the new standards that come with a more thorough cultivation."<ref target="n22" type="note">1</ref> Lacking "more thorough cultivation," an artist like William Blake seemed to Eliot a "resourceful Robinson Crusoe" whose estrangement from his age resulted in "crankiness" and "eccentricity" rather than allegiance to an established set of superior norms:
<q>
We have the same respect for Blake’s philosophy (and perhaps for that of Samuel Butler) that we have for an ingenious piece of home-made furniture: we admire the man who has put it together out of the odds and ends about the house . . . . What his genius required, and what it sadly lacked, was a framework of accepted and traditional ideas which would have prevented him from indulging in a philosophy of his own, and concentrated his attention upon the problems of the poet.<ref target="n23" type="note">2</ref></q><note id="n22"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Irving Babbitt, <hi rend="i">Rousseau and Romanticism</hi>, in <hi rend="i">Criticism: The Major Texts</hi>, ed. W. J. Bate (New York: Harcourt, 1970), p. 550.</note><note id="n23"><hi rend="s">2</hi> T. S. Eliot, "William Blake," in <hi rend="i">Selected Essays</hi> (New York: Harcourt, 1964), pp. 279-80. From a different perspective, Yeats also lamented that Blake "was a symbolist who had to invent his symbols . . . . He was a man crying out for a mythology, and trying to make one because he could not find one to his hand." "William Blake and the Imagination," in <hi rend="i">Essays and Introductions</hi> (New York: Collier Books, 1961), p. 114.</note></p>
          <p>As numerous studies of modernist criticism began to point out in the late 1950’s, this reaction against Romanticism concealed profound affinities with its adversary. Eliot’s appeal to Anglican Christianity, for example, did not support his work with a "framework of accepted and traditional ideas"
<pb id="p11-277" n="277"/><figure/>
but in the context of twentieth-century intellectual life was itself an eccentric gesture, like the "home-made" mythology which he constructed in poems like the <hi rend="i">Four Quartets.</hi> Books like John Bayley’s <hi rend="i">The Romantic Survival</hi> (1957), Frank Kermode’s <hi rend="i">Romantic Image</hi> (1957), Robert Langbaum’s <hi rend="i">The Poetry of Experience</hi> (1957), and Murray Krieger’s <hi rend="i">The New Apologists for Poetry</hi> (1956) all argued that modernist critics of Romanticism had only extended the very movement which they had tried to repudiate and that, in Northrop Frye’s words, "Anti-Romanticism . . . had no resources for becoming anything more than a post-Romantic movement" (SS, 216). "The Romantic movement in English literature," Frye continued, persisted because it seemed "a small part of one of the most decisive changes in the history of culture, so decisive as to make everything that has been written since post-Romantic, including, of course, everything that is regarded by its producers as anti-Romantic" (FI, 3).</p>
          <p>The publication of Frye’s own <hi rend="i">Anatomy of Criticism</hi> in 1957 appropriately coincided with these efforts to show the indebtedness of modernism to Romanticism. Unlike his New Critical predecessors, Frye from the outset of his study of literature affirmed his commitment to the Romantic tradition and his political discomfort with its critics. As he recalls in "The Search for Acceptable Words" (1973),
<q>
I expected that a good deal of contemporary literature would be devoted to attacking the alleged complacency of the values and standards I had been brought up in, and was not greatly disturbed when it did. But with the rise of Hitler in Germany, the agony of the Spanish Civil War, and the massacres and deportations of Stalinism, things began to get more serious. For Eliot to announce that he was Classical in literature, royalist in politics, and Anglo-Catholic in religion was all part of the game. But the feeling of personal outrage and betrayal that I felt when I opened <hi rend="i">After Strange Gods</hi> was something else again. And when Eliot was accompanied by Pound’s admiration for Mussolini, Yeats’ flirtations with the most irresponsible of the Irish leaders, Wyndham Lewis’ interest in Hitler, and the callow Marxism of younger writers, I felt that I could hardly get interested in any poet who was not closer to being the opposite in all respects to what Eliot thought he was. Or, if that was too specific, at least a poet who, even if dead, was still fighting for something that was alive. (SM, 14)
</q>
That poet, Frye goes on to say, was William Blake; the study of his work, begun in 1933, led to <hi rend="i">Fearful Symmetry</hi> (1947) and eventually to the theory of literature and criticism developed in the <hi rend="i">Anatomy.</hi><pb id="p11-278" n="278"/>
The progression, Frye notes,
<q>
from one interest to the other was inevitable, and it was obvious to anyone who read both books that my critical ideas had been derived from Blake. (SS, 160)
</q></p>
          <p>Convinced since <hi rend="i">Fearful Symmetry</hi> that Blake’s poetry contained "the keys to poetic thought" (SS, 178), Frye consistently has reaffirmed the Romantic assumptions which Eliot and others tried to disown. True to the independent spirit of Blake himself, however, he has used these critical ideas to support rather than circumscribe his own vision. He has written as Blake’s collaborator, not as his disciple or rival, and he has tried in his own way to keep alive "the values and standards" that first drew him to his poems. Rather than react against the influence of Blake’s work, Frye has attempted to read it in such a way as to strengthen its service to human life.</p>
          <p>Frye’s use of Romanticism builds on his assumption that Blake’s art is at its center. He agrees with those studies which make a revolt against Lockean empiricism the cornerstone of Romantic aesthetics.<ref target="n24" type="note">3</ref> But he argues that Blake is the paradigmatic Romantic artist precisely because he carried the revolt to its furthest extreme. The Romantic writers all claimed a degree of autonomy for their art and freed the imagination from bondage to philosophical reason, or that "owl-winged faculty of calculation" (Shelley) which they and even their mechanistic adversaries deemed a purely factual, "lazy Looker-on on an external World" (Coleridge). A poet like Wordsworth, however, made the artist’s independence from reason his means to spiritual truth, which he located both in the mind of man and in the external world. The poet, Wordsworth urged, worked in alliance with an active universe and did not project onto nature qualities which were not really there. "Willing to work," his imagination was able "to be wrought upon" by the spiritual presence which Wordsworth thought immanent in natural forms. <note id="n24"><hi rend="s">3</hi> See, for example, M. H. Abrams, <hi rend="i">The Mirror and the Lamp</hi> (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1953); Morse Peckham, <hi rend="i">Romanticism and Behavior</hi> (Columbia: Univ. of South Carolina, 1976); and René Wellek, "Romanticism Re-Examined," in <hi rend="i">Romanticism Reconsidered</hi>, ed. Northrop Frye (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1963), pp. 107-33. For different reasons each of these critics appreciates Blake’s criticisms of Locke but refuses to make him the prototype of the Romantic movement.</note></p>
          <p>For Blake, of course, "Natural Objects" deadened rather than fostered imagination; what Wordsworth "[wrote] Valuable [was] Not to be found in Nature" but in his own active mind (E, 655). From Blake’s point of view, Wordsworth’s anxiety to attribute to nature the spirit that was only in himself reflected nostalgia for a pre-scientific world and produced self-doubts that conservative Christianity finally had to resolve.<ref target="n25" type="note">4</ref> Blake himself, by contrast, accepted the meaninglessness of "this vegetable Glass of Nature" and elevated his art above any "such fitting &amp; fitted." Rather than share his creativity with nature or derive it from a transcendent God, Blake claimed radical self-sufficiency for his art: "All Forms are Perfect in the Poets mind. but these are not Abstracted nor Compounded from Nature but are from Imagination. . . .Man is born Like a Garden ready Planted &amp; Sown This World is Too poor to produce one Seed" (E, 637, 646). By making the severance of art from external reality the very strength of imaginative vision, he thus transvalued the conclusions of modern philosophy itself. The same assumption that "Inspiration" defies "Mortal &amp; Perishing Nature" made Lockean philosophers mock art and Blake accept it as his "Eternal Dwelling place." <note id="n25"><hi rend="s">4</hi> Studies of Wordsworth which accentuate his distrust of imagination frequently contrast his longing for harmony with nature to Blake’s desire for freedom from it. See especially Geoffrey Hartman, <hi rend="i">Wordsworth’s Poetry 1787-1814</hi> (1964; rpt. New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1971), pp. 169, 193-94, 233, and Harold Bloom, <hi rend="i">The Visionary Company</hi>, rev. ed. (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1971), pp. 127, 146.</note></p>
          <p>In Frye’s view, Blake is central to Romanticism because his claims for art are so severe. The Romantic movement marked what he calls the "recovery of projection" (SER, 14), or the discovery that all forms of civilization—works of art, institutions, etc.—originate in the human imagination rather than imitate external models. The advancement of science, of course, precipitated this discovery because it discredited the attribution of human meaning to the objective world. Although a writer like Wordsworth nevertheless sought the moral "ministry" of nature, Blake knew that the artist’s freedom from preexistent reality was unconditional and the very source of civilization itself:
<q>
Blake was the first and the most radical of the Romantics who identified the creative imagination of the poet with the creative power of God. . . .Everything we call "nature," the physical world around us, is sub-moral, sub-human, sub-imaginative; every act worth performing has as its object the redeeming of this nature into something with a genuinely human, and therefore divine, shape. Hence Blake’s poetry is not allegorical but mythopoeic, not obliquely related to a rational understanding of the human situation, the resolution of which is out of human hands, but a product of the creative energy that alone can redeem that situation. ("The Road of Excess," SS, 172)
</q>
Not a "literary freak" or "a kind of intellectual Robinson Crusoe" (FS, 147), Blake exemplifies Romanticism because he makes its "recovery of projection" absolute.</p>
          <p>Frye’s own contribution to criticism in the <hi rend="i">Anatomy</hi> picked up where Blake left off and responded to twentieth-century critics in much the same way as Blake had reacted to his Romantic contemporaries. Although critics like Brooks, Tate, and Wimsatt had exempted art from imitation of the rationally known world, they had nevertheless betrayed a Wordsworthian willingness to quality the artist’s autonomy. Literary works, they argued, were distinct from "scientific, historical, and philosophical propositions," but they still offered us "complete knowledge of man’s experience." Though not "the handmaiden of some doctrine which it is to reflect or ‘communicate,’" poetry, in Cleanth Brooks’s words, seemed "far more central to man’s nature than any subjective ‘projection.’"<ref target="n26" type="note">5</ref> Objective reason, however, could not validate these cognitive claims and the correspondence of poetry to reality remained nebulous because no "scientific or philosophical yardstick" could measure it.<ref target="n27" type="note">6</ref><note id="n26"><hi rend="s">5</hi> See Cleanth Brooks, <hi rend="i">The Well Wrought Urn</hi> (New York: Harvest Books, 1947), pp. 202, 252, 264, 266.</note><note id="n27"><hi rend="s">6</hi> As Gerald Graff points out in his <hi rend="i">Poetic Statement and Critical Dogma</hi> (Evanston: Northwestern Univ. Press, 1970), "The root of the problem is that the desire of post-Ricardian New Critics to claim an objective knowledge for poetry conflicts with assumptions that preclude the very possibility of objective knowledge. If the formulations of reason have no relevance to the deeper realities of experience, and if poetry is not predicated on rational knowledge, then it is not clear on what grounds objective truth can be claimed" (p. 16).</note></p>
          <p>Frye’s criticism injected into this discussion a Blakean renunciation of all such self-contradictory attempts to fit art to an external referent. Without equivocation, he has insisted in all his works that "the writer is neither a watcher nor a dreamer. Literature does not reflect life, but it doesn’t escape or withdraw from life either: it swallows it.
<pb id="p11-279" n="279"/>
And the imagination won’t stop until it’s swallowed everything" (EI, 80-81). Only the factual perspective of reason passively imitates life; the imagination redeems it by imposing human form onto the external world which reason accepts as meaningless. To guarantee the self-sufficiency of art, Frye emphasizes that literature itself—not "any observation of human life or behavior" (FI, 36)—provides the artist with his forms: "Poetry can only be made out of other poems, novels out of other novels. Literature shapes itself, and is not shaped externally: the <hi rend="i">forms</hi> of literature can no more exist outside literature than the forms of sonata and fugue and rondo can exist outside music" (AC, 97). A reservoir of imaginative possibilities or forms, literature in its ultimate "anagogic" phase remains self-contained; it swallows everything outside itself to encompass man’s limitless desire for a human world:
<q>
Nature is now inside the mind of an infinite man who builds his cities out of the Milky Way. This is not reality, but it is the conceivable or imaginative limit of desire, which is infinite, eternal, and hence apocalyptic. By an apocalypse I mean primarily the imaginative conception of the whole of nature as the content of an infinite and eternal living body which, if not
<figure/>
human, is closer to being human than to being inanimate. "The desire of man being infinite," said Blake, "the possession is infinite and himself infinite." (AC, 119)
</q></p>
          <p>The assumption that "literature shapes itself and is not shaped externally" makes metaphor and romance the central terms of Frye’s criticism. Metaphor is the fundamental linguistic device of literature because it expresses our desire to identify human concerns with the non-human world. The poet uses metaphor "because his job is not to describe nature, but to show you a world completely absorbed and possessed by the human mind" (EI, 32-33). Similarly, romance highlights the mastery of reality by imagination which renders literature "always a form of ‘lying,’ that is, of turning away from the descriptive use of language and the correspondence form of truth" (Sec S, 46). Rather than pretend that its context is an outer world which it imitates, romance accentuates what realism tries to hide, namely, the indebtedness of all literary works to literature itself. "The symbolic spread of realism," Frye notes in <hi rend="i">The Secular Scripture</hi>,
<q>
tends to go from the individual work of fiction into the life around it which it reflects: this can be
<figure/><pb id="p11-280" n="280"/>
accurately called allegorical. The symbolic spread of a romance tends rather to go into its literary context, to other romances that are most like it in the conventions adopted . . . . With romance it is much harder to avoid the feeling of convention, that the story is one of a family of similar stories. Hence in the criticism of romance we are led quickly from what the individual work says to what the entire convention it belongs to is saying through the work. (Sec S, 59-60)
</q>
The conventionality of romance secures its time-lessness and shows that literary works do not progress or become obsolete but instead "displace" immutable archetypes. The meaning of a romance, like the meaning of any literary work, lies not in itself or in the external world but in the enduring conventions which it shares with other works.<ref target="n28" type="note">7</ref><note id="n28"><hi rend="s">7</hi> New Critical objections to Frye often dispute the objective status of these archetypes, which he thinks connect literary works to literature as a whole. For a thoughtful discussion of these criticisms, see Hazard Adams, "Blake and the Postmodern," in <hi rend="i">William Blake: Essays for S. Foster Damon</hi>, ed. Alvin H. Rosenfeld (Providence: Brown Univ. Press, 1969), pp. 3-17.</note></p>
          <p>A "key to imaginative experience" (FI, 140), Blake’s poetry illustrates how metaphor and structure lead back to literature as a whole. Reading Blake’s lyrics moved Frye to assert that the fundamental unit of "formally poetic thinking" is the "inherently illogical metaphor" (FI, 141); studying his prophecies introduced him "to the grammar and structure of literary mythology" (FI, 143).<ref target="n29" type="note">8</ref> Other critics, notably David Erdman, have tried to dispute Blake’s characterization as a marginal, idiosyncratic figure by relating his work laterally to the public ideas and events of his day. Frye, however, has softened "the angularity of his genius" (FS, 3) by deriving his poetry vertically from literature itself. Blake’s metaphors and myths, Frye argues, do use the content of late eighteenth-century life, but they also allow him to communicate "beyond his context in time and space" (FS, 420). The structure of the ninth Night of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, for example, may signify Blake’s hopeful reaction to contemporary historical developments, but for Frye it also demonstrates his return "to the very headwaters of Western imagination, to the crystalline purity of vision of the <hi rend="i">Völuspa</hi> or the <hi rend="i">Muspilli</hi>, where the end of time is perceived, not as a vague hope, an allegory or an indigestible dogma, but as a physical fact as literal as a battle and as imminent as death" (FS, 305-6). Rather than stress with Erdman the presence of social content in Blake’s plots or imagery, Frye insists on its displacement into trans-historical literary form. Blake for him is neither a watcher who records life nor a dreamer who withdraws from it but an artist whose metaphors and myths recast reality into archetypal imaginative shape. <note id="n29"><hi rend="s">8</hi> The typicality of Blake’s lyrics and prophecies, in fact, makes him "formally popular" and "a key to imaginative experience for the untrained" (FI, 140-41).</note></p>
          <p>Frye brings out the conventionality rather than the topicality of Blake’s art not to seal it off from life but to respect its moral intentions. When he explains Blake’s poems in terms of literature itself, he may seem to resort to a hermetic aestheticism which betrays the values that first led him to his work. But placing Blake within a self-contained literary universe serves the ideals of a poet who thought art "the Destruction of Tyrannies or Bad Governments." The freedom of the imagination from external reality allows literature to liberate its readers; the radical autonomy of art insures its "socially emancipating" service to life (SM, 115). Frye’s theory frees art from history not for its own sake but for the sake of human freedom:
<q>
The ethical purpose of a liberal education is to liberate, which can only mean to make one capable of conceiving society as free, classless, and urbane. No such society exists, which is one reason why a liberal education must be deeply concerned with works of imagination. The imaginative element in works of art, again, lifts them clear of the bondage of history . . . . Thus liberal education liberates the works of culture themselves as well as the mind they educate. (AC, 347-48)
</q></p>
          <p>Unlike other politically minded critics, Erdman himself has never confused Frye with Oscar Wilde or failed to see that his reading of Blake remains faithful to the poet’s own social concerns.<ref target="n30" type="note">9</ref> He has, however, disputed the way in which Frye allies Blake’s art with liberation. For Erdman and the historian E. P. Thompson, Blake’s "intellectual warfare" with society continually found reinforcement
<figure/><pb id="p11-281" n="281"/>
in concrete political developments. Unlike Wordsworth or Coleridge, he consequently never allowed the failure of the French Revolution to blast his hopes for social progress and he always looked for the "reign of Literature &amp; the Arts" to begin in this world. He consistently satirized, in Erdman’s words, "those who can accept a spiritual apocalypse but are terrified at a resurrection of the body of society itself." Although Blake never shared the Urizenic ideology of radicals like Tom Paine, he nevertheless continued to enlist his art in the service of revolutionary action. As Erdman writes, "No spiritual legerdemain, he implies, can remove from the infinite world such ‘fallacies’ as slavery or prostitution unless <hi rend="i">action</hi> removes them from the ‘natural’ world. No matter how far Blake seems to go along with a mysticism that treats ‘the Natural Earth &amp; Atmosphere’ as ‘a Phantasy,’ he remains concerned with the essence of human history and is not seeking ‘spiritual’ escape from it."<ref target="n31" type="note">10</ref><note id="n30"><hi rend="s">9</hi> For criticisms of Frye which ignore the social intentions of his work, see the references to him in <hi rend="i">The Politics of Literature</hi>, ed. Louis Kampf and Paul Lauter (New York: Vintage Books, 1973). To critics (and admirers) who assert that he neglects "the social reference of literary criticism," Frye replies, "I have written about practically nothing else" (SS, x).</note><note id="n31"><hi rend="s">10</hi> See David V. Erdman, <hi rend="i">Blake: Prophet Against Empire</hi>, rev. ed. (Garden City: Doubleday Anchor Books, 1969), pp. 145, 178.

Thompson, <hi rend="i">The Making of the English Working Class</hi> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1963), pp. 52, 832</note></p>
          <p>For Frye and other critics, however, Blake qualified his aspirations for social change and went so far as to renounce his initial confidence in political action. Enthusiasm for the French Revolution lingered longer in him than in Coleridge or Wordsworth, but finally he, too, shifted from faith in political revolution to trust in imaginative revelation.<ref target="n32" type="note">11</ref> In his own terms, he transferred his allegiance from Orc to Los and even suggested that revolution cyclically leads to its opposite. His "revolutionary millenial optimism," in Frye’s words, evolved into "a cyclic Spenglerian pessimism" (FS, 219): "But as Orc stiffens into Urizen, it becomes manifest that the world is so constituted that no cause can triumph within it and still preserve its imaginative integrity. . . . The word ‘revolution’ itself contains a tragic irony: it is itself a part of the revolving of life and death in a circle of pain" (FS, 217-8). In Blake’s own words,
<q>
Many Persons such as Paine &amp; Voltaire with some of the Ancient Greeks say we will not converse concerning Good &amp; Evil we will live in Paradise &amp; Liberty You may do so in Spirit but not in the Mortal Body as you pretend till after the Last Judgment . . . while we are in the world of Mortality we Must Suffer The Whole Creation Groans to be deliverd there will always be as many Hypocrites born as Honest Men &amp; they will always have superior Power in Mortal Things You cannot have Liberty in this World without what you call Moral Virtue &amp; you cannot have Moral Virtue without the Slavery of that half of the Human Race who hate what you call Moral Virtue. (E, 554)
</q><note id="n32"><hi rend="s">11</hi> For further support of this view, see M. H. Abrams, <hi rend="i">Natural Supernaturalism</hi> (New York: Norton, 1971), pp. 334-42; Morton D. Paley, <hi rend="i">Energy and the Imagination</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1970); and Harold Fisch, "Blake’s Miltonic Moment," in <hi rend="i">Blake: Essays for S. Foster Damon</hi>, pp. 36-56.</note></p>
          <p>From the outset of his literary career, Blake had traced social conditions to intellectual causes. Lack of imagination made Reynolds, for example, accept nature as an unchanging, external model and preach "Passive and Polite" submission to the inalterable authority of the "Rich &amp; Great." When the French Revolution failed, Blake, in Frye’s view, switched to "Mental Fight" with society and made freedom result from the intellectual rejection of error which he called a "Last Judgment": "The Last Judgment is an Overwhelming of Bad Art &amp; Science . . . . Error or Creation will be Burned Up &amp; then &amp; not till then Truth or Eternity will appear It is Burnt up the Moment Men cease to behold it I assert for My self that I do not behold the Outward Creation &amp; that to me it is hindrance &amp; not Action it is as the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me" (E, 555). Despite his disillusionment with Orc, he did not abandon hope for the historical "imminence of an apocalypse" (FS, 217). But he did argue that art can free the individual mentally without first changing society as a whole. A "residual anarchism," Frye notes, informed his typically Romantic contention that art emancipates the individual by releasing him "in Spirit" from the outer world.<ref target="n33" type="note">12</ref><note id="n33"><hi rend="s">12</hi> See SER, 48, 118-19 for further discussion of the "residual anarchism" that Frye locates at the heart of the movement. In <hi rend="i">The Return of Eden</hi> he finds a similar disillusionment with political action in Milton’s poetry and suggests that the logic of literature itself pushes him to "find the true revolution within the individual" (112).</note></p>
          <p>In determining whether Blake made freedom the effect of social or intellectual change, Erdman and Frye assign crucial importance to the demise of the French Revolution. In Erdman’s analysis this failure did not discredit all political activity for Blake, but in Frye’s view it split apart the alliance between imagination and history which he had forged in early poems like <hi rend="i">America.</hi> Frye’s own literary theory incorporates the disillusionment which he finds in Blake’s work; political history since the Romantic period only provides him additional reasons for distrusting Orc. Society seems an "eternally unwilling recipient of culture" (FS, 90), and "revolutionary action, of whatever kind, leads to the dictatorship of one class and the record of history seems clear that there is no quicker way of destroying the benefits of culture" (AC, 347). But if social life and political action destroy freedom, literature and the other arts still further it: "It is possible that social, political, or religious revolution always, and necessarily, betrays a revolutionary ideal of which the imagination alone preserves the secret" (Sec S, 165).</p>
          <p>Literature promotes freedom by infusing its readers with imaginative energy. Rather than advocate specific values or "myths of concern," literature teaches that all such expressions are possibilities which the imagination itself has conceived. According to Frye, we passively adjust to society when we accept its values as objective or necessary facts; we actively criticize it when we see that its beliefs are imaginative creations projected onto "things as they are." As he writes in <hi rend="i">The Critical Path</hi>,
<q>
Evidently we must come to terms with the fact that mythical and logical languages are distinct. The vision of things as they could or should be certainly has to depend on the vision of things as they are. But what is between them is not so much a point of contact as an existential gap, a revolutionary and transforming act of choice. The beliefs we hold and the kind of society we try to construct are chosen from infinite possibilities, and the notion that our choices are inevitably connected with things as they are, whether through the mind of God or the constitution of nature, always turns out to be an illusion of habit. (CP, 104-05)
</q><pb id="p11-282" n="282"/>
In a kind of "Last Judgment," literature activates our imagination and allows it to see that the society we accept is no more "real" than the one we desire. Although "the society around us looks like the real world," the "ideal world that our imaginations develop inside us" is for Frye "the real form of human society hidden behind the one we see." We live, then, "in both a social and cultural environment, and only the cultural environment, the world we study in the arts and sciences, can provide the kind of standards and values we need if we’re to do anything better than adjust" (EI, 152-53).</p>
          <p>Like Blake’s Jerusalem, this "cultural environment" is not "one more objective environment" but the power of conceiving alternatives to our present one (SS, 198).<ref target="n34" type="note">13</ref> For Frye, only the exercise of this power constitutes genuine freedom; no matter what political efforts we make to improve it, life in society can never free us so completely as use of imagination. "The only genuine freedom," he writes,
<q>
is a freedom of the will which is informed by a vision, and this vision can only come to us through the intellect and the imagination, and through the arts and sciences which embody them, the analogies of whatever truth and beauty we can reach. In this kind of freedom the opposition to necessity disappears: for scientists and artists and scholars, as such, what they want to do and what they have to do become the same thing. This is the core of freedom that no concern can ever include or replace, and everything else that we associate with freedom proceeds from it. (CP, 133)
</q>
Romance, the heart of literature, illustrates this in its very structure. Unlike comedy, which terminates in a new community, romance "has no continuing city as its final resting place": "We reach the ideal of romance through a progressive bursting of closed circles, first of social mythology, whether frivolous or serious, then of nature, and finally of the comic-providential universe of Christianity and other religions, including Marxism, which contains them both" (Sec S, 173).<ref target="n35" type="note">14</ref><note id="n34"><hi rend="s">13</hi> As Frye makes this point in <hi rend="i">The Modern Century</hi>, art liberates our imagination rather than provides us with "a statement both of what is believed to be true and of what is giong to be true by a course of action" (116). Using our imagination frees us, but "all forms of politics, including the radical form, seem sooner or later to dwindle into a specialized chess game" (101).</note><note id="n35"><hi rend="s">14</hi> Frye illustrates this point by appealing to romance in Romantic literature (SER, 37-40) and to Shakespeare’s later plays (see <hi rend="i">Fools of Time</hi>, pp. 120-21, and <hi rend="i">A Natural Perspective</hi>, pp. 75-117).</note></p>
          <p>Frye does not discourage all political efforts to make society as free as our participation in our "cultural environment." But he does temper the expectations we bring to political action and warns that no historical setting will ever realize the imaginative freedom we experience as individuals. The only institution that permits this freedom, in fact, already "sits in the middle of our society" (SM, 42). This institution is the university, where individuals enjoy a greater freedom than society can ever give, namely, "the freedom that comes only from articulation, the ability to produce, as well as respond to, verbal structures."<ref target="n36" type="note">15</ref> The university community provides "the only visible direction in which our higher loyalties and obligations can go" (SS, 256) because it alone encourages mental access to the "articulated worlds of consciousness, the intelligible and imaginative worlds, that are at once the reward of freedom and the guarantee of it" (CP, 170). <note id="n36"><hi rend="s">15</hi> "Presidential Address 1976," <hi rend="i">PMLA</hi>, 92 (May, 1977), 389. Frye consequently defended the university in the 1960’s against those student activists who doubted the reality or value of its autonomy. See, for example, "The University and Personal Life," SM, 27-48.</note></p>
          <p>The university, in short, offers the imagination the chance to exercise its autonomy and thus construct the cultural environment which Frye opposes to the natural world and to the mythology of society. For him, the legacy of English Romanticism is William Blake’s concern for human freedom and his fear of docile adjustment to the constraints or hindrances of "the outward creation." Frye, like Blake, dreads confinement to the dull round of valueless nature, or that world which limits the factual discoveries of reason. He also fears uncritical submission to the values of contemporary society, or that capitulation which occurs when we treat social myths with the same deference we give to nature. Against both rational imitation of nature and passive accommodation to society, he places the creative imagination and urges us to complete the "recovery of projection" that began in the Romantic period.</p>
          <p>This recovery, which made modernist critics uncomfortable, fills Frye with the Blakean hope that art will check our advancement toward a "self-policing state," or a "society incapable of formulating an articulate criticism of itself and of developing a will to act in its light" (MC, 45). We must finally measure Frye’s achievement in terms of the values he has tried to keep alive. As a literary critic, he challenges us to emulate his own relation to Blake; he asks us not to fit into his "system" but to share his social vision. In trusting that vision to the autonomous imagination, he has either resisted or complied with that subversion of freedom which he has always deplored in the world outside art. From the perspective of reason, he has conceded, the poet’s defiance of society is as irrational as his acquiescence; all value judgments are imaginative possibilities, not imperatives grounded in fact. Political action may aim at a free society, but it, too, cannot bridge the gap between imaginative vision and "things as they are." The poet consequently stands alone in his defense of freedom and articulates an ideal which reason and history dismiss as a dream. To evaluate Frye’s work, we must determine whether this scheme grasps the importance of art or underestimates its critical power. Elsewhere I have argued that Frye has reduced rather than strengthened literature;<ref target="n37" type="note">16</ref> but other critics, such as Robert Langbaum, have contended that he has saved art "as the last great sign of man’s freedom or indeterminacy" and "the only creator of values in a world where other branches of knowledge have either ceased to deal with values or have limited themselves to analyzing and describing values."<ref target="n38" type="note">17</ref> "The socially emancipating role" that Frye assigns to the arts suggests the larger question at stake in this discussion. In making art the sole safeguard of freedom, Frye has either secured liberty or allowed it to recede into mere imagining. <note id="n37"><hi rend="s">16</hi> See my "The Imagination as a Sanction of Value: Northrop Frye and the Uses of Literature," <hi rend="i">Centennial Review</hi>, 21 (Spring, 1977), 105-117.</note><note id="n38"><hi rend="s">17</hi> See Langbaum’s "The Function of Criticism Once More," in <hi rend="i">The Modern Spirit</hi> (New York: Oxford Univ.

          <p>The valuation of will by English writers before the Romantic period is not a favorable one. Ulysses’ speech on order in <hi rend="i">Troilus and Cressida</hi> associates it with "appetite," devouring and self-devouring, a connection later elaborated by Hobbes and dramatized by Milton in the figure of Satan. Heroic drama, too, seems in essence a disembodied conflict of imperial wills, each devoted to conquest until annihilated either by force of arms or the power of love. Blake is never more "English Blake" than in his epic depiction of the fall of the Zoas into willful selfishness and their rivalry with the Female Will engendered from their worldly appetites. Blake’s giant forms enact the pattern of self-division and aggression he found in his immediate tradition. And of course he spoke from the historical center of a whirlwind of will generated by political ambition, as Ulysses did. Faced with Robespierre, Pitt, and then Napoleon, no Romantic artist could endorse the privileges of an individualistic craving for power, though some, like Wordsworth and Coleridge, came to tolerate certain repressive measures by the State after the Congress of Vienna.</p>
          <p>While the English tradition, including Blake, sought boundaries for the appetitive will, a series of German philosophers glorified it by transmuting its essential character. Schelling, Hegel, Fichte, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer—these are the principal contributors to a nineteenth-century doctrine that sought to preserve the individual from self-contempt by apotheosizing a will to power, usually collective power, sometimes the power of the State. Whatever these writers would have said about Hitler, he became their inevitable disciple. It is no accident that the most famous artwork of this century bearing the word is Leni Riefenstahl’s propaganda film, <hi rend="i">Triumph of the Will</hi>, with its Wagnerian motifs, its famous opening shots of the Leader descending from the clouds to address a multitude which he has welded into a single militant will. The reputation of Romantic philosophy, especially the German variety, suffered from the Nazi experience. (I remember vividly a lecture in my undergraduate philosophy course on Hegel’s theory of the Will and the State. After some twenty minutes the professor stopped in mid-sentence and exclaimed, "I refuse to go on pretending this nonsense is philosophy.’") The general antagonism overflowed into criticism of the English tradition as well, for texts of Blake, Byron, and Carlyle especially lent themselves to the kind of suspicion one finds in Eric Bentley’s <hi rend="i">A Century of Hero Worship</hi>, not to mention the New Criticism and the wartime polemics that Jacques Barzun attempted to refute in <hi rend="i">Romanticism and the Modern Ego.</hi></p>
          <p>The critic who wishes to give a positive valuation to the Romantic Will must proceed with care. <hi rend="i">Manfred</hi> and <hi rend="i">Heroes and Hero Worship</hi> must go unmentioned this time around, and their

admirer Nietzsche as well. Michael G. Cooke does just this, and though his tactic of making-texts-invisible is certainly suspect, his study is illuminating and cohesive. Examination of a psychic faculty as it seems to operate in or inform a number of texts can be a thankless task. And the will especially, because it governs choice, decision, and action, can be discerned almost everywhere in lyric and narrative situations. Cooke has not let this difficulty defeat him but has constructed a canon that enables him to emphasize the sanity of Romantic striving, its proverbial Englishness.</p>
          <p>Cooke proceeds as one might expect: he distinguishes between what this reviewer (not the author) might term the primary and secondary will. The primary will Cooke describes in various places as "empirical or locally purposive," "particular," and "merely personal." This is the will manifest in assertive states, when the self is in the act of defining specific objectives, or bringing about specific changes through conscious choice. The defiance of Jupiter by Prometheus is one example, or the intentions of Wordsworth when in <hi rend="i">The Prelude</hi> he steals a rowboat or climbs Mt. Snowdon to see the sunrise. When Keats in his early work insists that he <hi rend="i">will</hi> be a poet, he is exercising this primary activity of mind. This is the will that seeks for trophies—for knowledge, fame, and power. Though it can be a hazard if embraced as an exclusive good, it is a necessary precondition for the operation of the secondary will.</p>
          <p>The secondary will Cooke describes as a "will of being," an "ontological" or "metaphysical" will. It most frequently appears when the other has subsided and the mind achieves not the petty trophy it sought but a new state of consciousness informed with what Wordsworth calls the "sentiment of being," the apprehension of powers greater than the self with which the self harmoniously participates. The product of this mutality is joy, the joy that cannot, by the foregoing definition, be actively sought as an object—Coleridge explains this in the Dejection Ode—but must inform the mind already as a condition of being discovered. Cooke cites the Simplon Pass episode of <hi rend="i">The Prelude</hi> as a <hi rend="i">locus classicus</hi> of the passage from one state of will to another, Wordsworth being granted an apocalyptic vision in the act of checking off another item on his tourist itinerary.</p>
          <p>Cooke’s thesis is that the Romantic will permits this secondary act of mind by keeping fluid or open the relation between "self and system." The neoclassical position, Cooke writes, "is that the self is best in the system, the system is best for the self." He illustrates this rather uncontroversial point by extensive and wholly superfluous analyses of works by Corneille, Addison, Boileau, Pope, and Molière. I might add that the choice and treatment of texts throughout is something of a puzzle. Cooke’s discussion of the Romantic will seems to be headed toward a significant new perspective on <hi rend="i">Prometheus Unbound</hi>, and yet that work receives less attention than does <hi rend="i">Tartuffe.</hi> Commentary on the Dejection Ode is truncated, but we get a lengthy rehash of Geoffrey Hartman’s reading of "The Solitary Reaper." This last passage constitutes yet another one of those <hi rend="i">hommages à Hartman</hi> that seem to have become obligatory in writings on Romanticism emerging from Yale. Cooke has produced a good book, but there is a lingering sense of the devoted pupil in these pages, expressed by his choice of some literary and critical texts, his avoidance of others, and his emphatic use of the terminology of "consciousness."</p>
          <p>His study of Blake, however, is provocative and if not wholly original at least seems consonant with his general conclusions rather than an external "system." Cooke focuses on <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> because of his interest in the way "Blake immediately, bluntly, and uncompromisingly gears this poem to the satisfaction of the will of Los." Los’s will is a form of terror; he seeks to coerce the results he desires by means that may not always have the reader’s approval. Cooke sees this as Blake’s Prometheanism, a mode most familiar to us from the discomfiting Proverbs of Hell and the dramatic situations in his early prophetic works that still have the power to unsettle us. I have always been disturbed, for example, by Oothoon’s offer to Theotormon in the <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>:
<q>
But silken nets and traps of adamant will Oothoon spread,<lb/>
And catch for thee girls of mild silver or of furious gold
</q>
We admire Oothoon for conquering her shame and jealousy, but wonder whether compelling other girls to find pleasure in copulation with her mate isn’t a little Bromion-like. Her action corresponds to Los’s treatment of the Spectre without the saving consideration that the Spectre is, after all, not another person but a negative temptation of Los’s own nature.</p>
          <p>It is not so much Los’s exercise of the primary will that interests Cooke as the fact that Los’s will is a will to art, and the artist’s salvific influence must wait upon the public’s appreciation of his perfected vision. Unlike Orc, "the Los character . . . remains for his part curiously dependent and subject to the vicissitudes of place and person." Los can bring no resolution to the action, however bold his commandments to the Sons and Daughters of Albion. He can only suffer the injustices he observes and propose, usually in isolation, the truth his idolatrous and selfish community needs for its redemption. A reading of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> that sees the conclusion as an apocalypse created by Los’s will to power, according to Cooke, confuses Blake with Los; it mistakes the successful fact of the text with the drama within. Rather, a reader must observe that Blake <hi rend="i">and</hi> Los become identified with Christ by a recognition of universal suffering. Again, the striving primary will is suspended and the dramatic effect, culminating in Albion’s leap into the Furnaces of Affliction, is a radical change of being that makes genuine compassion possible.</p>
          <pb id="p11-286" n="286"/>
          <p>Cooke could have made useful reference to Blake’s letters to illustrate the connection between Los the character and Blake the creator. Blake seems obsessed with his mission as an artist and with the worldly comforters who tempted him to bury his talent. <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> is among other things an autobiographical anatomy of his triumphant will to art, concluding honestly—a heroic moment in Blake’s verse—with the artist breaking his wand as a condition of collective salvation. <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, the reader must realize, is an act of Memory to some degree, and like other "filthy garments" (<hi rend="i">Milton</hi> 41:6) soiled by Experience it must be burned with its creator in the last fiery furnace. When Blake ceased to struggle with willfulness he relapsed into just the kind of high-toned dogma he once put into the mouth of Urizen. We then get nostrums like the <hi rend="i">Laocoón</hi> with its thundering commandments: "A Poet, a Painter, a Musician, an Architect: the Man or Woman who is not one of these is not a Christian." Fortunately Blake did not write a new epic in his last years or we might have gotten something akin to the priestly books of <hi rend="i">The Excursion.</hi></p>
          <p>Art is Blake’s tabernacle and fortress both. His enemy is the poet’s onetime object of worship, The Female Will, the figure of sexual generation, for whose favor even the sensible English tradition put itself in chains.
<q>
Read in my face, a volume of despairs,<lb/>
The wailing Iliads of my tragic woe;<lb/>
Drawn with my blood, and printed with my cares,<lb/>
Wrought by her hand, that I have honored so.<lb/>
Who whilst I burn, she sings at my soul’s wrack,<lb/>
Looking aloft from the turret of her pride:<lb/>
There my soul’s tyrant joys her, in the sack<lb/>
Of her own seat, whereof I made her guide.<lb/>
There do these smokes that from affliction rise<lb/>
Serve as an incense to a cruel Dame:<lb/>
A sacrifice thrice grateful to her eyes,<lb/>
Because their power serves to exact the same.<lb/>
Thus ruins she, to satisfy her will,<lb/>
The Temple, where her name was honored still.
</q>
Thus Samuel Daniel. Worship of the Female Will is the type of idolatry, and it is crucial to the artist’s triumph in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, a political as well as an autobiographical poem, that Los overcome the very will to power that Blake had applauded in liberated women like Oothoon in those balmy days when he thought Orc was a splendid fellow. Cooke simply refuses to engage this aspect of Blake’s sensibility, to enter the dramatic conflict involving the omnipresent voices of the Female Will—Enitharmon, Gwendolen, Cambel, Vala, Tirzah, Rahab, Britannia—which proclaim that "The Man who respects Woman shall be despised by Woman / And deadly cunning &amp; mean abjectness only, shall enjoy them / For I will make their place of joy &amp; love excrementious." Blake avenges himself upon the speaker by making her publicly confess these appalling facts of life. A reader of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> must see how English Blake reforms his tradition at this point, but to do so reference must be made to works like Daniel’s poem, or <hi rend="i">Samson Agonistes</hi>, or the like; <hi rend="i">Tartuffe</hi> will be no help, nor <hi rend="i">Cato</hi>, nor <hi rend="i">L’Art Poètique.</hi> Cooke loses contact with Blake because he seems out of sympathy with Blake’s tortured struggles against the genital conditions of the fallen world. Cooke tries to be superior to his subject, who seems (to him) an unconscionably long time in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> resolving the agon of the primary will. In addition, an effusive passage of Cooke’s on the contribution of the Daughters of Albion to Los’s labors suggests that the author has raised his consciousness high enough to overlook Blake’s putative sexism. The Female principle is a hero of <hi rend="i">The Romantic Will</hi>, emerging in full glory during Cooke’s extended, and well-argued, analyses of <hi rend="i">The Fall of Hyperion</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Ode to Autumn.</hi> But even this triumph would be more significant if part of Blake’s text had not been made invisible, if Blake had not been read retrospectively through the medium of Keats’s resolution.</p>
          <p>Blake believed that art has the power to correct even sexual division. Samuel Daniel cremates himself, Blake sends Albion into the furnace so that the Sexes (and sex) must vanish and cease. From this willed death the public that undergoes it, by means of the poem <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, may arise into life. But in what form? Albion’s first regenerate act is to reach for his Bow of desire: "And he clothed himself in Bow &amp; Arrows, in awful state, Fourfold." He slays the Druid Spectre, or rational part, of Humanity. The passage deliberately echoes the description of the Spectre Sons of Albion in Plates 65-66, "immense in strength &amp; power / In awful pomp and gold," who construct Stonehenge as a temple of the Enlightenment. In this latter-day Arthurian romance English Blake slays Voltaire and Rousseau. He sends flaming arrows into Bacon, Newton, and Locke. The militant tone of this passage, so reminiscent of Edward Young in its destructive fantasies masked as patriotism and piety (Albion and Christ), makes me a little uncomfortable, and my misgivings extend to analyses like Cooke’s which identify the "final moment" (Cooke’s phrase) of the poem as Albion’s sacrifice. In my text the poem does not end at 96:35.</p>
          <p>Cooke rightfully says that a Romantic poem tends to waver between Prometheanism and Stoicism, and that its structure is more often an oscillation between the two poles than a direct movement from one state of being to another. This suggests the problem of interpretation we encounter in confronting Romantic texts, never sure which points can be assembled into an authentic pattern, always reading a concluding scene or a penultimate scene as a definitive statement. Artists like Blake planned it that way, of course, by keeping their "system" open enough to accommodate our own changing perspective. Whatsoever point we gain,
<pb id="p11-287" n="287"/>
we yet have something to pursue. A critic’s disregard of native tradition and historical context, then, and his recourse to the language of "consciousness," will result in a partial but not comprehensive reading of a text as complex as <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> In his armed vision, his appetite for a Christian Triumph as absolute as Edward Young’s, Blake simply cannot be mistaken for Wordsworth or Keats or Wallace Stevens or anyone else. The errors of generalization, as Blake eloquently maintained, outweight the insights. If Blake were Cooke’s Blake he would not speak so compellingly to a public still convinced, in depths so profound that only art can reach, that it will escape non-entity by finding new worlds to conquer.</p>

          <p>The British Antiquities are now in the Artist’s hands" wrote Blake in <hi rend="i">A Descriptive Catalogue.</hi> This rebound issue of Joan Evans’s book, distributed by Thames &amp; Hudson, and dealing with the Society’s history from its Renaissance precursors up to the early 1950’s, provides a timely opportunity for examining the intellectual context of Blake’s "visionary contemplations" concerning his own country.</p>
          <p>Professor England has shown us how Samuel Foote’s parody of an Antiquaries meeting in <hi rend="i">The Nabob</hi> led the way to Etruscan Column’s lecture on "virtuous cats" in "An Island in the Moon." Reading through the eighteenth-century part of this history one can see how nearly Foote held the mirror up to life. This production of the summer of 1772 must have virtually coincided with the beginning of Blake’s apprenticeship to James Basire, who had been the Society’s engraver since March 1759. Foote’s joke about Antiquaries and cats had been sparked off by a paper read by Samuel Pegge in December 1771 in which he conjectured that Dick Whittington’s "cat" had been the name of a type of ship. The ridicule prompted by <hi rend="i">The Nabob</hi> brought Horace Walpole’s resignation from the Society in 1773 but he had earlier confided his intention in a letter to William Cole written on 28 July 1772, only a few days before Blake’s exchange of indentures with Basire. Despite nineteen years of membership, Walpole’s involvement with the Society had been indifferent and recently embittered by criticism, so that this episode of "their council on Whittington and his cat, and the ridicule that Foote has thrown on them" (to Cole) provided a convenient but honorable occasion for departure.</p>
          <p>The Basire family held their position well into the nineteenth century, and Joan Evans has made the forgiveable error of attributing William as the apprentice of James Basire the Younger who was elected a Fellow in 1823. Fortunately for Blake’s training, both master and apprentice had only the very highest standards to seek to emulate since, until his death, almost all previous engraving for the Society had been under the management and general surveillance of George Vertue. Vertue had not only been one of the Society’s founder members, but both benevolent and indefatigably active on its behalf for nearly half a century, and it was largely through his influence that the early parts of <hi rend="i">Vestuta Monumenta</hi> contained as much medieval material as they did. It was for this irregularly issued record of the Society’s activities and interests that Blake’s Westminster Abbey sketches were intended, probably following the immediate initiative of Richard Gough, who had become their enthusiastic Director the year before Blake’s entry into apprenticeship.</p>
          <p>In his <hi rend="i">Topographical Antiquities</hi> (1768), Gough had bemoaned the lack of an antiquarian periodical
<pb id="p11-288" n="288"/>
miscellany, and during the period of Blake’s apprenticeship he put much energy into insuring the continued publication of the Society’s <hi rend="i">Archaeologia</hi>, which had begun in 1770 in order to fulfill this role. Such were Gough’s efforts in this direction that Blake’s Westminster Abbey sketches remained unpublished until 1780, but the <hi rend="i">Archaeologia</hi>, while adding a new dimension to the Society’s pursuits, radically increased the amount of engraving undertaken by Basire for the Society. During Blake’s apprenticeship, issues were published in 1773, 1775, 1777 and 1779. Most of the papers are illustrated with engravings signed by Basire, and it is a source of harmless speculation to wonder how many of them Blake had a hand in.</p>
          <p>After his resignation Horace Walpole greeted most of the Society’s enthusiasms with amused incredulity, and there were certainly enough <hi rend="i">Archaeologia</hi> papers on such topics as cockfighting, horseshoes and buried bird bones to validate his reactions. Their interests were not narrowly in archaeological "hardware," however, and a similar impulse to that which prompted the publication of papers on the origin of the word "Romance" and on "The Wisdom of the Ancient Egyptians" must have led the President, Jeremiah Milles, to sponsor the second edition of Chatterton’s Rowley poems in 1782 despite the cordially tepid response from the rest of the Society, who appear to have sensed the presence of forgery.</p>
          <p>It is difficult to escape the conclusion that at this period the Society was intellectually second-rate: certainly their ranks in the second half of the century can muster no mind approaching that of William Stukeley, whose varied researches had been without parallel during the Society’s early years. Inevitably, this "antique" company of aged and conscious exclusiveness became the fair and easy victim of caricaturists from both within, such as Francis Grose, and without, such as Thomas Rowlandson. Joan Evans reproduces an interesting Rowlandson cartoon dating from c. 1795 which appears to be based on the opening of the tomb of Edward I in 1772, when Blake was probably present. Entitled "Death and the Antiquaries," a group of antiquaries gather round an opened royal tomb, one stealing a ring from the corpse, while a skeletal Death stands outraged above. This episode was remarkable in the Society’s history because it was just about the first time they had been taken seriously enough to be allowed to interfere with a relic of national importance. The late date of Rowlandson’s plate is silent testimony enough to the uneventful obscurity to which they subsequently returned.</p>
          <p>Although such figures in Blake’s world as Benjamin Heath Malkin and Henry Crabb Robinson found admittance to the Society at some point in their lives, the Antiquaries and their pursuits had little effect on Blake’s imagination or intellectual development. To return to his remarks in <hi rend="i">A Descriptive Catalogue</hi>, it is clear that the "British Antiquities" have already become transformed into a part of the Blake Pantheon. Blake recognized antiquity as witness to the loss of imagination and the ascendancy of memory. The sublime truth represented diagramatically in the well-known illustration of the Mundane Shell and Universes of the Four Zoas in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> became distorted and petrified into the serpent temples of Britain. Milton’s journey from Eternity, seen in Time by Milton’s vision of Satan’s fall through the Serpentarius constellation in Ophiucus (<hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> Bk. II), was distorted by the Druids into the serpent and mundane shell configuration of the serpent temples. The transfiguring re-emergence from the mundane shell, which Blake characterizes as being without dimension, became further distorted by Druidic vision into the other half of the serpent ascending out of the circle of stones in unconscious repetition of the original fall. This portrayal of the cosmological through the antique probably had its beginnings in the eighteenth century’s association of stone circles with sun worship, but the development is so extensive as to leave these theories far behind. In similar fashion, Blake’s reference to the "pavement of Watling-street" in <hi rend="i">A Descriptive Catalogue</hi> comprehends not only the ancient Roman road but the traditional English (and Chaucerian) name for the Milky Way.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the antiquarian writers Blake most obviously seems to have admired, such as Jacob Bryant and Edward Davies, figured little if at all in the Society’s affairs and neither finds acknowledgement in Joan Evans’s book. The congenial literary and mythological emphasis of these writers was declining in importance as more scientific methods of inquiry began to assert their worth (to the Society’s benefit, it has to be said). Outside the Society, isolated enthusiasts continued their researches relatively untroubled by the consensus of informed development, and it was from these quarters that some of the most imaginative studies stemmed. In the final years of the eighteenth century, the antiquarian writer who most obviously exemplified the virtues Blake admired was Thomas Maurice, whose <hi rend="i">Indian Antiquities</hi> ranges over the cultures of the major Mediterranean, Northern and Eastern civilizations before returning to an extended account of Stonehenge and ancient Britain during the course of proving his thesis that all nations have spontaneously recognized a divine trinity. For the student of the backgrounds of Romanticism in comparative mythology and antiquity, Maurice’s work provides a clear and well-documented guide to the state of research as it existed in these fields and may be used in conjunction with the broad outlines offered by Joan Evans, but the Blakeophile will inevitably need to consult <hi rend="i">A History of The Society of Antiquaries</hi> for knowledge of the Society’s interests and personalities during the period of his apprenticeship.</p>

          <p>A fully developed biography of Blake which reverses the distortions of contemporary gossip and subsequent critical confusion is a major priority of Blake studies. Michael Davis has produced a diligent and enthusiastic book, but one which does not answer this need. It offers neither the new historical information nor the new theoretical approach which would justify a new biography, and it does not assemble old knowledge in a productive way.</p>
          <p>What is suggestive in this volume is the sense it provides, in plates and brief descriptions, of the physical environments in which Blake worked. This suggestiveness is not realized, however, in any developed analysis of the effect on Blake’s life and art of these environments.</p>
          <p>Davis studied widely in contemporary sources, both graphic and verbal, but most of what he studied has been studied before. Any originality is lost in his narrative method, which absorbs generations of critical commentary without annotation. His account, for example, of the connection between Blake and John Stedman and the effect of that connection on <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> is useful, but does not progress beyond accounts by Erdman and Keynes; that it does not makes the reader skeptical that any of Davis’ other observations goes beyond his sources.</p>
          <p>There are rhetorical problems which also undermine a reader’s confidence in this study. One of these problems is a distracting carelessness in tone. Davis calls <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> a book "whose sharp ambiguities, versatility and irreverent humour bubble with imaginative energy" (p. 61); he asserts flatly that "The biblical story of Job does not solve the problem of suffering. Blake’s twenty-one pictures do" (p. 143); he notes in passing that Mary Wollstonecraft "pursued Fuseli for a while" (p. 38), as if she were either Vala or a boy-crazy ninthgrader. These are certainly minor lapses, but they are characteristic, and they occasionally yield to graver insensitivity: "In Blake’s illustrations [of <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>], Oothoon is white, <hi rend="i">as befits the soul of slavery</hi> . . . . She could say, with the little black boy in <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>, ‘I am black, but O! my soul is white’" (pp. 54-55, emphasis mine). There is debate over the degree, even the existence of irony in Blake’s use of such imagery, but however much or little irony we allow Blake, we cannot allow a critic in 1977 to pass off without clearly defined ironic purpose an attitude which equates goodness with whiteness and paternalistically assumes that blacks are, contrary to appearances, just as good as anyone else.</p>
          <p>Another rhetorical problem is a confusing vagueness in Davis’ definitions of Blake’s myth: "Single vision is seen by the eye only; twofold vision sees <hi rend="i">through</hi> the eye and perceives the human value in all things; threefold vision reveals thought in emotional form and inspires
<pb id="p11-290" n="290"/>
creation; fourfold vision is mystical ecstasy" (p. 25, emphasis in original).</p>
          <p>This kind of rhetoric is much thicker in the opening chapters of <hi rend="i">A New Kind of Man</hi>, perhaps because in these chapters Davis deals with a period of Blake’s life for which there is little documentation. As soon as he gets to Blake’s maturity, about which there is, if not full documentation, at least a lot of recorded gossip, his narrative settles into a genial commentary linking quotations from Blake’s prose (particularly his letters) and his contemporaries’ accounts of him.</p>
          <p>For all its geniality, however, that narrative has two major deficiencies. First, its interpretations of Blake’s thought and art are often either hopelessly over-simplified (you cannot legitimately say in one sentence that "Blake respected Newton, as he did Bacon and Locke . . . " and then add in the next, without explanation, "A scientific trinity who gave form to error, they are counterparts of ‘Milton &amp; Shakspear &amp; Chaucer’, who expressed truth" [p. 69]), or just plain wrong: "Blake stooped to fasten his shoe before walking out to seek inspiration for his poem <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> in the Vale of Lambeth" (p. 47); "In complete contrast to that unlovely attack [in <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi>] on a world in which imagination has been murdered by repression, shines his exultant, endearing masterpiece of the same year, 1789, <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>, surely a labour of love" (p. 43); "The Fall is experienced by every person. It occurs in each individual’s life at adolescence and changes Innocence into Experience" (p. 55).</p>
          <p>Second, major terms of the biography are neither defined nor demonstrated. Davis calls Blake, at least from 1787-93, a revolutionary (chapter 3 and <hi rend="i">passim</hi>), a man "subversive but neglected" (p. 63); he insists that "there is no doubt that Blake held seditious views" (p. 106). Blake’s revolutionism is a principal tenet of the book, but Davis’ one real attempt to describe it is almost comically imprecise: he calls Blake a radical, citing as evidence his outrage at the war against the American colonists and noting in the next sentences that "Blake also detested government. At Basire’s he had engraved some of the many illustrations in a book of memoirs by Thomas Hollis, an ardent devotee of Milton’s grand, ideal [?] republicanism, and Blake found Milton’s revolutionary fervour very congenial" (p. 24). Radicalism, war opposition, anarchism, republicanism, revolutionism—all equated, none defined. Exactly <hi rend="i">what</hi> seditious views did Blake hold? What is a revolutionary anyway? One could argue that a poet who calls in his or her work for revolutionary change is a revolutionary—Davis does not develop such an argument about Blake. In fact, he seems to belie it: he hypothesizes that <hi rend="i">The French Revolution</hi> may have been abandoned because, "in an era when a revolutionary would, if discreet, avoid political subjects to keep himself out of Newgate" (p. 50), this revolutionary Blake, "a prey to ‘Nervous Fear’ of imprisonment, himself withdrew the poem" (p. 48). What kind of revolutionary? One who promulgates revolutionary ideas only when they are safe and harmless? Similarly but less significantly, the "Pilgrimage in Poverty" which titles Chapter 7 is a pilgrimage unexplained. What kind of pilgrimage?</p>
          <p>In short, the "new kind of man" this biography sets out to describe never emerges. The phrase itself, taken from Francis Oliver Finch, seems to refer mostly to Blake’s emphasizing his "extreme opinions" (p. 154). What new kind of man? The portrait we get in this book is not only not of a new kind of man, it is an old kind of portrait. Davis’ Blake is an alternately gruff and ecstatic eccentric who is, Davis insists (must we still insist this?), not mad—but whom anyone not his intimate would be justified in taking for mad, so uncompromisingly strange did he choose to make himself seem in public. Even Davis’ readers might feel so justified: we are meant to see here a revolutionary heroically true to his vision, but we are given so little understanding of that vision that we might as easily see instead a dirty, crabby fanatic. This portrait of Blake is as retrogressive as the criticism which once again turns the <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> into a puberty crisis.</p>
          <p>I do not know why this biography was undertaken, unless it was to allow the author to spend time and energy on a figure he admires. That is a fine ambition, and I in no way wish to demean it. Michael Davis reads like an amiable man with a strong if not penetrating appreciation of a great poet. I wish there were millions of such people. I wish there were as many books as people can write. Since there are not, I must question why the University of California Press chose to publish this one.</p>

I think of sailing for America, where I may aid the struggles of liberty, may freely publish all which the efforts of reason can teach me, and at the same time may form a society of savages, who seem in consequence of their very ignorance to have a less quantity of error, and therefore to be less liable to repel truth than those whose information is more multifarious.
</q>
          <p>Frank Henley’s project for fleeing the England depicted in Holcroft’s <hi rend="i">Anna St. Ives</hi> (1792) sums up what America meant to defenders of the French Revolution. America was the successful revolutionary society; the open society in which censorship and suspension of habeas corpus were unknown; the locus of innocence and noble savages, free of all the forms (primogeniture and the rest) that curb and corrupt. Robert Bage, in <hi rend="i">Hermsprong, or Man As He Is Not</hi> (1796), invented a Frank Henley who had been brought up in America, sent him to France during the Revolution, and then dropped him down like Voltaire’s Huron in England of the Pittite repression. Hermsprong is like Blake’s allegories of the American Revolution in that he can also act energetically when action is called for. He has soon discomfited and defeated the flabby aristocrats, and for good measure (being among other things a descendent of Tom Jones) shown them to be usurpers of his own rightful patrimony in England.</p>
          <p>What continues to surprise me is the fact that this image of the American Revolution as fiery Orc was primary an English one, promulgated by sympathetic English propagandists in the 1770s and in the 1790s. Even Burke, who was to find these qualities noxious in the French revolutionaries, praised the Americans’ active, energetic, youthful course of action, which he contrasted with "the listlessness that has fallen upon almost all" Englishmen. The Americans are "savage . . . uncouth," but "animated with the first glow and activity of juvenile heart." But of course Burke was also defending America’s loss of ancient traditional rights against the innovative commercial policies of the English government.</p>
          <p>In 1975 M. W. Jones’ <hi rend="i">Cartoon History of the American Revolution</hi> appeared, and in the year of the centennial Joan Dolmetsch published a selection of the American Revolution cartoons (or to be historically accurate, satiric prints) from the Colonial Williamsburg collection. This is a more elegant, better produced (and reproduced) volume than Jones’, which had the format and general appearance of newsprint. Jones supplied a racy running text with chronological lists and suggestive juxtapositions of prints (three or four to a page) of the sort one associates with a <hi rend="i">Time-Life</hi> educational series. Dolmetsch supplies catalogue entries with complete bibliographical information, description, and citations from the <hi rend="i">British Museum Catalogue of Satiric Prints and Drawings.</hi> Yet for cartoons whose artistic quality is almost nil but whose context is of great interest, Jones’ tabloid format may have been more appropriate as well as more informative.</p>
          <pb id="p11-292" n="292"/>
          <p>The satiric prints were almost entirely English and continental. America seems to have produced very few other than copies of the English ones: a fact which may help to explain the dearth of fiery Orc-fiqures. The two powerful images produced on the American side are omitted from Dolmetsch’s collection, probably because technically they are not satiric prints. One is <hi rend="i">The Boston Massacre</hi> of 1770, the essential image as the American propagandists wanted it seen: helpless Bostonians being shot down by British soldiers lined up to resemble a firing squad. This was the image that stimulated the colonists to revolt and secured sympathy from the English Opposition (and was later adapted by Goya for his <hi rend="i">Third of May</hi>). The other image was a representation of the overturning of George III’s statue in New York City on 4 July 1776 (the newspaper blockprint of the scene followed within days; the elaborate engraving some years later). Here are the Orc overtones so noticeably missing in earlier American propaganda. Indians are even present in the crowd, as a sort of reference to one sturdy aspect of the Americans (as Frank Henley’s remarks show, "American" meant equally Indian and "savage" to eighteenth-century Englishmen), and perhaps also to the Boston Tea Party, where Bostonians disguised as Indians to carry out an un-English act. There is even present that ubiquitous eighteenth-century symbol of dissent and natural subversion, a dog.</p>
          <p>But aside from that one blockprint in a New York newspaper none of the ritual crowd action (from Baltimore to Boston) following the Declaration of Independence was recorded in graphic imagery; any more than the active image of the Boston Tea Party of two years earlier was exploited by the Americans. The colonists did in fact react by casting tea in Boston Harbor, by tarring and feathering Tories, and by forcing customs officers to drink large quantities of tea (in one case in toasts to a large variety of subversive subjects, reminiscent of the Wilkite crowd action of the 1770s). But these scenes were portrayed for propaganda purposes only by English sympathizers of the colonists in London.</p>
          <p>It is possible to trace the origin of the graphic image. In April 1774 there was <hi rend="i">The Whitehall Pump</hi> (Dolmetsch, no. 23), a satiric print showing Lord North pumping water over and into the mouth of a prone Britannia to revive her. She has collapsed on top of the prone Indian brave who represents America. In <hi rend="i">The Able Doctor or America swallowing the Bitter Draught</hi> (p. 7), published in the May <hi rend="i">London Magazine</hi>, the female figure has been turned into an American. Lord North is forcing the Boston tea down the throat of this bare-breasted Indian maiden, held by Lord Mansfield, with Lord Sandwich (notorious womanizer that he was) securing her legs and peering up her skirt. Britannia, standing by, covers her eyes in shame. Even here, however, America is shown gallantly spitting the tea back in Lord North’s face. By June this image of America in the role of patient corresponding to the Americans of <hi rend="i">The Boston Massacre</hi> was copied by Paul Revere for <hi rend="i">The Royal American Magazine.</hi> In October the roles were reversed in a series of English mezzotint prints (nos. 25-27): the active American colonists are now forcing tea down the throat of, and tarring and feathering, English customs officers. Then, not reproduced by Dolmetsch (reproduced by Jones, p. 49), is the atrocity print, <hi rend="i">Hancock’s Warehouse for Tarring &amp; Feathering</hi>, where the party being mishandled by the patriots has become a pretty semi-nude English woman.</p>
          <p>There is no indication that the prints in which the Americans are the aggressors were copied in America, though they were probably imported. Another in the English mezzotint series is <hi rend="i">The Patriotic Barber of New York</hi> (no. 32), which shows the barber chasing a Tory out of his shop, razor at the ready. Especially interesting is the rearing horse of <hi rend="i">A Political Lesson</hi> (no. 25) in which the vigorous American horse is casting off his English master. These show precisely the graphic image the Americans repressed.</p>
          <p>The difference between the internal and external images is, I suppose, that the Americans initially saw themselves as the underdog and oppressed victim. They did not want to associate themselves officially with the kind of Wilkite insubordination upon which in many ways they actually modelled their actions. Accordingly the paradigm that stirred souls was the Boston Massacre until the Declaration of Independence, when the really mythic image appeared in the destruction of the statue of George III, with its echoes of the primal horde dismembering the Father/King, which Paine had already adumbrated—in effect had called for—in <hi rend="i">Common Sense</hi> a few months before.</p>
          <p>It was at this time that the "Don’t Tread on Me" flag, showing the coiled rattlesnake, came into temporary use. (The image of the divided snake of the disunited colonies—"Join or Die"—goes back to the French-Indian War but reemerged as a patriotic image in the Stamp Act Crisis.) By the 1780s the rattlesnake of the flag had become the property of English cartoonists (Dolmetsch, nos. 79, 84; Jones, pp. 158, 177). The image is shunned by American artists, and appears to have been quickly swept under the carpet. But it is possible to conclude that in pre-revolutionary times when the colonists felt oppressed the figure invoked was passive or female; in the revolutionary moment when they were the aggressor, the figure represented a male principle. The aggressive maleness of the statue-breakers and of the snake was the aspect developed by Blake in his serpentine Orc.</p>
          <p>But by that time the official American image (with a Federalist government in power) had been painted by John Trumbull, who on the eve of the Revolution in France was representing the successful American Revolution in terms of the Boston Massacre. Only faintly does he reflect the youth-age conflict, so powerful in Paine and Blake. In <hi rend="i">Bunker Hill</hi> the British tend to be fairly elderly and jowled, while the central American figures are young. Something like the British Oak appears in the battle scenes that follow, decaying from painting to painting until it has fallen to the ground in <hi rend="i">The Surrender of General Burgoyne</hi>, where a luxuriantly leafy tree first appears, a Liberty Tree of the sort seen in the background of the prints in which Americans tar and feather British customs officers. These are
<pb id="p11-293" n="293"/>
perpheral details. Trumbull’s central imagery is of passivity in the hands of a benign providence. His paintings alternate scenes of defeat or dying generals with images of such covenants as an enemy general’s surrender, the Declaration of Independence, and Washington resigning his commission as general of the army.</p>
          <p>What we see are two different responses, competing by the 1790s, but by then one of them advocated most strongly by Americans, the other by the Englishmen Paine and Blake. The images summed up by Trumbull probably represent the fact that Americans considered their relationship with the king as contractual and indeed believed all political authority to be based on compact. But they also reflect the position of John Adams and the Boston Presbyterians who still drew on a belief in election for an elite and government by covenant, its model ultimately the covenant of the Chosen People with God. Naturally Trumbull used images of providential suffering and martyrdom as preparation for the victory he knew was to follow. Paine and Blake shared the same roots and traditions of English working-class radicalism, which kept alive the heresies of the Ranters and Levellers. They believed not in election for an elite but in election for all, not in government by covenant and passivity in the hands of God but in active energetic attack—indeed attack on the Father Himself and on all figures of authority. It is understandable that Trumbull represented the covenant as the essence of the American Revolution; it was Paine’s purpose to destroy this idea, and he exploited the subliminal feelings of the colonists for the paternal relationship, which they as earnestly repressed. It should have surprised no one that Paine went on to demystify the Father in Heaven Himself in his <hi rend="i">Age of Reason</hi>, or that the American government was in no hurry to acknowledge him as one of themselves by seeking his release from prison during the Terror.</p>
          <p>One view of English literary history in the 1790s is expressed by Howard Mumford Jones in <hi rend="i">Revolution and Romanticism</hi>: a shift in epistemology, from empiricism to Kantian idealism, explains the difference between the behavior of a Washington or Jefferson and a Danton or Robespierre—and, I suppose we could add, between a Diderot and David, Wilkes and Cobbett, or Gray and Blake. Melvin J. Lasky in <hi rend="i">Utopia and Revolution</hi> argues that the uninterrupted continuation of the empiricist tradition in England (characteristically English, he implies) saved England from the rationalist excesses of the French Revolution. Carl Woodring in <hi rend="i">Politics and English Romantic Poetry</hi> argues that the rationalist emphasis on natural law <hi rend="i">and</hi> the empirical concern with individual experience explain the whole phenomenon of the French Revolution, and also the early sympathy of the Romantic poets, as well as the later conflict that developed between their liberal tenets and their growing faith in imaginative perception and organic wholeness. In effect, the conjunction of the empirical-liberal tradition <hi rend="i">and</hi> the French Revolution created Romanticism. Woodring avoids Jones’ determinism (the rise of Kantian idealism produced a state of mind that conditioned Robespierre or allowed him to do the outrageous things he did) along with Lasky’s confident anglophilia, and explains the human conflict lacking in the pre-Romantic writers and artists, which sets off the poems of Blake, Wordsworth, and Coleridge.</p>
          <p>Gary Kelly’s subject is the Jacobin novel—also sometimes called the radical or reform novel, since "Jacobin" was a term applied by the unsympathetic to writing that had been largely shaped before the French Revolution began by writers some of whom were sometimes Jacobins. The paradox of Kelly’s thesis concerning these novels is how little they were affected by the events of 1789 and following. The best of them, however, do seem to have required that injection of historical violence on the scale and at the distance of the French Revolution. The Revolution, in other words, may account for the difference between Charlotte Smith’s <hi rend="i">Emmeline</hi> (1788) and Holcroft’s <hi rend="i">Anna St. Ives</hi> (1792), and above all between these and Godwin’s <hi rend="i">Caleb Williams</hi>, the one undeniably major work of the Jacobin novel genre. Anna St. Ives, a granddaughter of Clarissa, is still the object of genteel attempted rape, but Godwin’s hero is locked in a master-slave relationship which involves broader forms of social violence and destroys both parties (as happened in <hi rend="i">Clarissa</hi> but not in <hi rend="i">Anna St. Ives</hi>).</p>
          <p>Kelly’s study of the Jacobin novelists is welcome. The available books on the French Revolution and the English poets, novelists, and playwrights are uniformly antiquated and limited to biography and plot summary. Kelly offers the first serious attempt to define radical fiction of the 1780s and 90s and assess its importance. He carries with him some traces of the earlier approach and of the doctoral dissertation. So few of these novels are now read that an extreme circumstantiality of treatment is required for the general reader (which includes Kelly’s <hi rend="i">TLS</hi> reviewer, who seems to have read only <hi rend="i">Caleb Williams</hi>). A reader becomes a little impatient with the equally emphatic coverage of one item after another, and annoyed to find words, phrases, and sentences repeated verbatim sometimes only a few pages apart. Nevertheless, Kelly’s treatment of the subject is both intelligent and sensitive, often stimulating, and here and there adventurous (as in his treatment of names as historical allegory). Given its scope, the book is extremely informative. Its limits are Inchbald, Bage, Holcroft, and Godwin. The chapter on Godwin is easily the most impressive thing in the book. Kelly has written his equally good Wollstonecraft chapter as introduction to his edition of <hi rend="i">Mary</hi> and <hi rend="i">Maria</hi> in the Oxford English Novel series.</p>
          <p>I will try to place Kelly’s findings in context. One’s first literary referent in any revolutionary period is the drama—the danger spot most closely scrutinized by politicians; witness Walpole’s Licensing Act and Corbyn Morris’ supporting opinion that it is far more difficult
<pb id="p11-294" n="294"/>
to efface the impression of what is seen and heard than what is merely read. It is therefore no surprise to find the dramatic response to the French Revolution in operatic entertainments. The plays that went seriously, though clumsily, at the real issues and took sides were prohibited and never performed. Even so, the surviving texts show that they generally took the allegorical way out, through parallels in earlier English history or in Roman or Swiss history (just as the French were doing across the Channel). A few attempted to dramatize the current events in Paris, with Charlotte Corday or Robespierre as protagonist.</p>
          <p>Scholars examining this material tend to look for specific references to France or liberty or rebellion, and have overlooked the area of greatest literary interest: the analogical plots developed by writers who could not, or did not wish to, express their feelings directly. We are told that Holcroft’s play <hi rend="i">Love’s Frailties</hi> (1794) was hissed off the stage for the line "I was bred to the most useless, and often the most worthless of all professions; that of a gentleman." Such a sentence was one sign of Jacobin sentiment. But what distinguishes <hi rend="i">Love’s Frailties</hi> is its modification of the <hi rend="i">Marriage of Figaro</hi> plot, brought into the revolutionary period (Holcroft also made an expurgated translation of Beaumarchais’ play). The English version of the <hi rend="i">droit de seigneur</hi> is an uncle who controls the marriages of his charges—siblings, each of whom is in love with an unsuitable person, a soldier for her and a painter’s daughter for him. The old guardian who prohibits these matches pursues young girls himself, and the plot is an animated version of a Rowlandson situation with the old guardian, the young girl he pursues, and her young lover (who, of course, turns out to be the old man’s charge). On the one hand the young folk rebel and marry as they please, and on the other the old man is thwarted in his personal designs on the young girl. Love, it is made clear, is both the great leveller and the great catalyst for rebellious action, and the battle is between generations (whether the participants are called father-son-daughter or guardian-brother-sister).</p>
          <p>As Kelly’s examples document, the situation of domestic tyranny was already present in novels of the 1780s as a paradigm of repression and rebellion. As early as <hi rend="i">Mount Heneth</hi> (1782) Bage was using his characters’ speeches to make the analogy between domestic and national tyranny; and what is implicit in the 80s becomes explicit in the 90s in references to the situation with Hastings in India and the lost colonies of America (<hi rend="i">Man As He Is</hi>, 1792). Bage is the least representative of these novelists, because he remains fairly well confined within the comic tradition of Fielding and Smollett. Kelly thinks, with good reason, that his covert and overt domestic analogies fit politically into the rationalist and empirical opposition to Filmer’s patriarchal monarchy. But the question of continuum or interruption haunts Kelly’s book. There is a chasm between the emphasis domestic tyranny receives in the 1780s, let alone the 90s, and in <hi rend="i">Tom Jones</hi> and <hi rend="i">Marriage à la Mode</hi>, where it is also an integral part. Intervening—though Kelly does not mention the fact—are the intensifying phenomena of Wilkes and the Gordon Riots, as well as the American Revolution and Burke’s attack on Hastings. There is the question whether, as Kelly says, "events had turned one of Bage’s favourite themes into a piece of provocative radicalism" or whether as a result of the possibilities loosed by the Wilkite propaganda and the American Revolution, some literature itself was turning in this more radical and provocative direction.</p>
          <p>Some questions remain. Why does Bage—admittedly an imitator of Fielding—have to go to Montesquieu (as Kelly has him do) for his stress on "virtuous living rather than the mere outward forms of religion"? The theme was an old one in England, present in the works of Bishop Hoadly as well as Fielding, long before Bage began to write. How do we distinguish the image of the villainous titled aristocrat as a phenomenon of the 1780s (the dividing line, Kelly notes, seems to have been baronet/baron)? Richardson’s Lovelace was <hi rend="i">not</hi> an aristocrat in the later sense. When and why does the break occur with the older and more conservative convention of attacking not higher orders but "fashion" and the middleclass "desire to ape a higher level of society"? "Luxury" too was essentially a topos used by the upperclass to criticize the lower orders. Why then in the 1780s does it become attached, as Kelly shows it does, to the titled aristocrat?</p>
          <p>The convention that could probably bear most investigation is the arranged/forced marriage, already present in Hogarth’s <hi rend="i">Marriage à la Mode</hi> and Richardson’s <hi rend="i">Clarissa.</hi> Here the question is less the rape of an innocent than the forced marriage from which Clarissa escapes into rape. A story can often be dated by its solution to the problem of how to overthrow this tyranny. In <hi rend="i">Marriage à la Mode</hi> overthrow is effected by natural forces after the marriage; in <hi rend="i">Clarissa</hi> by the daughter’s willful action before the marriage takes place, but with equally terrible consequences for all. In the Gothic novels out of Walpole’s <hi rend="i">Castle of Otranto</hi> the defiance precedes marriage—as in the old romances—by mere flight. The literary aspect of the change in the 1780s turns on the conventions of the Gothic, which transform the situation of domestic tyranny into a more extreme situation with ruined castles serving as implicit trappings of royal tyranny (on the decline). One other factor only glancingly mentioned by Kelly is the women novelists of the Gothic who preceded Inchbald, in particular Charlotte Smith. The Gothic charge was picked up by a novelist like Smith, who found therein a vehicle for expressing her own feelings in the figure of a Gothic heroine—feelings the male novelist simply did not share, did not even have much reason to feel or notice in her novels.</p>
          <p>The woman’s experience, like that of the black slave, was a model standing ready for use when the Revolution erupted in 1789. The experience of the female chattel, of oppression with no recourse to law, of sexual pursuit and assault upon body and mind, all provided the woman novelist (who had also read <hi rend="i">Clarissa</hi> and <hi rend="i">Otranto</hi>) with the experience
<pb id="p11-295" n="295"/>
and the point for a revolutionary novel—or an anticipation of one—which could be adapted by Holcroft and Godwin when the moment was ripe. The emphasis might be on the wife’s feelings of guilt, but at its best in Inchbald’s <hi rend="i">Simple Story</hi> (1791) the scenario ends in the increasingly censorious and dictatorial husband against whom his wife can only rebel in adultery. Wollstonecraft’s <hi rend="i">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</hi> and <hi rend="i">Maria</hi> are only the discursive and melodramatic extremes of this plot.</p>
          <p>In the 1780s and into the 90s Charlotte Smith’s women remain peripheral, the marital horrors and the adultery taking place off stage, and usually to secondary characters. The emphasis is on the virtue of the heroine who remains faithful to her worthless husband, but the strength of the novel lies in its portrayal of the husband. Then in <hi rend="i">Desmond</hi> (1792) the characters talk about the Revolution in France, underline the parallel between the French and English situations, and shift our admiration from the wife’s virtue to her brave behavior in a situation of tyranny.</p>
          <p>What sets apart Kelly’s main protagonists, Inchbald, Holcroft, and Godwin, is their adherence to the rational strain of literary-political-philosophical theorizing. This is present not only in the dialogues on philosophical issues in their novels but in the theoretical basis for the formal structure that sets their best novels above other English fiction of the 1790s. This was the search for "unity of design" which Holcroft was advocating in the preface to <hi rend="i">Alwyn</hi> as early as 1780—and so "the simplicity which is requisite" (taken up in the title of Inchbald’s <hi rend="i">Simple Story</hi>). Unity and simplicity also derived from the integration of plot and character through the "doctrine of necessity," the belief that "The characters of men originate in their external circumstances." The formal result at its best was a remarkable union of character and incident.</p>
          <p>The special kind of novel that was produced had as its object, in Holcroft’s words, to "develop the emotions that preceded and the causes that produced the passion, and, afterward, trace it through all its consequences." The action was, in short, a passion—a relationship or entanglement, with its emotions and causes as well as its consequences analyzed in some depth; and the form the passion took was one involving love and compulsion, rape of one sort or another, and mastery, based on the model of <hi rend="i">Clarissa.</hi> The line of transmission was from the Clarissa-Lovelace symplegma which ends in mutual destruction, a consequence of his need to subjugate and hers to maintain her freedom; to Rousseau’s <hi rend="i">Julie</hi> and Mackenzie’s <hi rend="i">Julia de Roubigné</hi>, where the situation becomes a triangle involving an impossible love for a younger man and a marriage with an older (in Julia’s case the husband’s jealousy leads to her murder). Thus we arrive at Inchbald’s <hi rend="i">Simple Story.</hi> On one level its two parts, contrasting Miss Milner with the wrong education and Matilda with the right one, merely correspond to the two protagonists of her later novel <hi rend="i">Nature and Art</hi> (1796). This is not, however, the simple <hi rend="i">Industry and Idleness</hi> or <hi rend="i">Sanford and Merton</hi> plot that surfaces in Inchbald’s less inspired work. For on another level the two parts correspond to two versions, in two generations, of the power struggle between an older father-lover and the young girl. (She also uses the January-May theme, with its personal as well as political motivations, in her play <hi rend="i">The Child of Nature</hi>, 1788.) Dorriforth is guardian, Catholic priest, moralist, Miss Milner’s dead father’s substitute, eventually (ennobled as Lord Elmwood) a titled aristocrat, and Matilda’s actual but invisible father. Inchbald manages to get in all the oppressive relationships that materialize in the imagery of Burke and Paine after the outbreak of the Revolution. Against this authority figure appears natural, untutored, giddy, freedom-loving Miss Milner. She loves Dorriforth and he her, but the love includes subjugation (and self-subjugation) and is tested by her rebellion and his subsequent tyranny, with its effects on the next generation and its finally ameliorist solution (a corrective to Miss Milner’s revolutionary one). Inchbald projects a world of Dorriforth’s house which is strangely like the Garden of Eden with its tempter God in Blake’s "Poison Tree," suggesting as it does the repetition of the struggle for each new generation.</p>
          <p>What makes <hi rend="i">A Simple Story</hi> so attractive is that the situation it dramatizes is remarkably appropriate to the time, without being in any way allegorically or analogically related to what was happening (or even was about to happen, since it was largely written before 1789) in France. Kelly has it exactly right when he sums up the strength of the novel as Inchbald’s portrayal of "the repression and the force of powerful but natural feelings." His remarks are illuminating on the subject: "Dorriforth, Miss Milner, Sandford [the clergyman friend of Dorriforth], are all locked in a moral and psychological bastille built by reason and pride, and since words are the language of this super-ego, only gestures can elude the censorship of conscience to tell the story of the heart’s imprisonment." Although "bastille" is his own metaphor, Kelly is uncovering the strand connecting <hi rend="i">A Simple Story</hi> to Sterne’s <hi rend="i">Sentimental Journey</hi>, and even to <hi rend="i">Joseph Andrews.</hi> It is still part of the sentimental tradition, where the inauthenticity of words was an essential ingredient. ("But how unimportant, how weak, how ineffectual are <hi rend="i">words</hi> in conversation," we read in <hi rend="i">A Simple Story</hi>, "—looks and manners alone express—".) But <hi rend="i">A Simple Story</hi> also shows how these assumptions can become Jacobin, either by placing Sterne’s caged starling, or even Rousseau’s, in a context of the fall of the Bastille, or by intensifying the feeling and the symbolism of the situation by adding, however implicitly, a political dimension.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">A Simple Story</hi> is the work without which <hi rend="i">Anna St. Ives</hi> and <hi rend="i">Caleb Williams</hi> would have been inconceivable. If one theme, as Holcroft states his aim in <hi rend="i">Anna St. Ives</hi>, is "teaching fortitude to females," and this fortitude is in the face of a guardian or husband, another that follows is the conflict of the generations. Here it is the old Sir Arthur St. Ives and Abimilech Henley against young Anna and Frank, and the relationship of the oppressive or foolish parents and the rebellious
<pb id="p11-296" n="296"/>
children joins the Jacobin thesis that education and changing circumstances affect character ("the virtuous children can make reparation for the errors of their parents," in Kelly’s words). There is also, carried over from <hi rend="i">A Simple Story</hi>, "the conflict between [Anna’s] rational intentions and her unconscious yearnings and fears" (cf. Inchbald’s "showing the force of feeling by the force necessary to suppress it"). In <hi rend="i">her</hi> terms, her love for Frank conflicts with her duty to Sir Arthur as passion conflicts with reason: "Indeed indeed, Frank, it is not my heart that refuses you; it is my understanding; it is principle; it is a determination not to do that which my reason cannot justify. . . ." But of the real problem, she says: "I cannot encounter the malediction of a father!—What! Behold him in an agony of cursing his child?—I cannot!—I cannot!—It must not be!" " . . . because," says Frank, "this wise world has decreed that to abhor, reprove, and avoid vice in a father, instead of being the performance of a duty, is offensive to all moral feeling."</p>
          <p>The lesson of these rather fine though minor novels is that the important percursors of <hi rend="i">Caleb Williams</hi> (or <hi rend="i">Things as They Are, or the Adventures of Caleb Williams</hi>, Godwin’s first, Jacobin title) are not the overt radical novels but some granddaughters of <hi rend="i">Clarissa.</hi> What Godwin does is to change the sex, making it man against man, father against son, instead of the father (husband) against the daughter (wife) of Inchbald and Holcroft. He does not omit the sexual nexus of the Caleb-Falkland relationship, but now it introduces the Oedipal dimension which had been displaced heretofore to the daughter. And he ruthlessly carries out in both of his endings the implications elided by his fellow Jacobin novelists. His revised ending is not very satisfactorily explained by Kelly as Godwin’s wanting an optimistic ending which mitigates Caleb’s triumph with remorse. Rather the fact that Caleb has in effect <hi rend="i">become</hi> the murderer Falkland, the slave and master changing roles, reflects the central problem, which Godwin shared with his contemporary Blake, of whether history is a closed structure as the MS. ending suggests; one involving irreversible change; or merely cyclic and repetitive.</p>
          <p>If we put aside the Godwin model for a "Jacobin novel" embodied in this succession of novels, we are left with a number of more traditional models. These are masked by the tendency to call Jacobin fiction (plays as well as novels) <hi rend="i">Such Things Are</hi> or <hi rend="i">Wives as They Were and Maids as They Are</hi> (Inchbald, 1787 and 1797), <hi rend="i">Man as He Is, Things as They Are, Elinor, or The World As It Is</hi> (Mary J. Hanaway, 1798), and <hi rend="i">What Has Been</hi> (Mrs. Mathews, 1803). These titles, usually disingenuous, do express the attempt to get out from behind the conventions of fiction and show conditions as they were. The greatest and most successful case was Goya’s <hi rend="i">Desastres</hi> with the inscriptions "Can such things be?" or "Such things are," or "I saw this myself." But in England these titles expressed an ideal rather than an accomplishment.</p>
          <p>We can imagine a writer asking himself: how <hi rend="i">does</hi> one write a revolutionary novel (overt or covert) in the 1790s in England? The novelistic alternatives seem to have been to portray a hero who goes out into the world and learns how corruptly society operates, and is disillusioned; or to portray a hero who, once he has learned this, goes around setting things straight. The first was Holcroft’s strategy in <hi rend="i">Hugh Trevor</hi> (1794-97), which is hardly an advance on <hi rend="i">Roderick Random.</hi> The second solution was followed by Bage in <hi rend="i">Hermsprong, or Man as He Is Not</hi> (1796). An American, an echo of the Huron in Voltaire’s <hi rend="i">L’Ingenu</hi>, with no clear past, enters and disrupts the remote, over-conventionalized society of Grondale. He talks about the French Revolution and the clampdown of Freedom of speech and thought in England, seeing from the vantage of an American who has come to England by way of France.</p>
          <p>It is no surprise to find a great many children either disowned or cut off by their fathers. (Hugh Trevor has the same sort of relationship with his grandfather.) In <hi rend="i">Hermsprong</hi> Glen’s father will not acknowledge him; Miss Campinet’s will barely acknowledge her, sending her off to live with an aunt; Miss Fluart’s father has died, turning her over to a lawyer-guardian. Bage takes up Burke’s panegyric on primogeniture and aristocratic chivalry and gives us appalling examples in Lord Grondale and Sir Philip Chestrum, with Dr. Blick their today clergyman. A sprightly dialogue between Miss Campinet and Miss Fluart replays the argument between Anna and Frank Henley on the loyalty to a father, concluding that a tie of blood is not sufficient sanction for tyranny. Hermsprong is lucky enough to have no such ties. Asked where the "price" of custom "is <hi rend="i">not</hi> paid," he answers Miss Campinet: "Amongst the aborigines of America, Miss Campinet. There . . . I was born a savage." "I am a young American, without father or mother; but with a fortune that sets me above the necessity of employment." Thus he operates as an Orc figure who shatters the image of the decadent, self-indulgent aristocracy (Bage’s image of leading-strings recalls Goya’s <hi rend="i">Capricho</hi> No. 4). Having assumed their inherited role as protector in emergencies when they are absent or unable to act, he proceeds to defeat their strategies to discredit him, and at the end reveals himself to be the rightful heir to the land and title which Lord Grondale has usurped.</p>
          <p>His being himself an aristocrat is a convention which keeps the novel safe. Another is Bage’s denouement. After preparing for an uprising of Lord Grondale’s miners, with his fiefdom collapsing around his ears and this English Louis XVI even planning a "flight to Varennes," Bage has the revolt fail to materialize when Hermsprong dissuades the miners, using arguments of an almost Pittite hue.</p>
          <p>Kelly sees these novelists as somewhat more original than I do. He argues for various kinds of revision, or what he calls Jacobinizing, of the conventional forms, both social and fictional. The Jacobinization of the Smollettian picaresque in <hi rend="i">Hugh Trevor</hi> involves making the "impetuosity" of
<pb id="p11-297" n="297"/>
the picaro reflect the French, supposedly regarded by the English as impetuous, and moreso in their catastrophically over-zealous revolution. Richardson’s Sir Charles Grandison, the perfect Christian hero, is Jacobinized by Godwin into Ferdinando Falkland. It emerges that Jacobinization means allegorizing, or re-allegorizing, conventional forms or topoi. Kelly’s chief contribution, I believe, lies in his drawing attention to these revolutionary reformulations, though (as in the case of "impetuosity") I do not always find myself convinced in particular cases.</p>
          <p>Coke Clifton, the potential Lovelace of <hi rend="i">Anna St. Ives</hi>, undoubtedly carries with him Burkean overtones of chivalry, to be seen in their "true colors." The Chateau of Villebrun appears to be a translation of Brunswick and the count who has read the Provencal poets and romanciers "till he has made himself a kind of Don Quixote" evokes, of course, Paine’s name for Burke. One thinks of Erdman’s interpretation of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, with its allusions to Gillray caricatures of Burke and Pitt, when Kelly argues that Sir Barnard Bray and Falkland (and to some extent St. Leon) are all portraits of Burke; as Dr. Blick, the fat Bishop in <hi rend="i">Hugh Trevor</hi>, and other bad clergymen are portraits of Bishop Horsley; Lord Idford alludes to the Duke of Portland; and <hi rend="i">Bryan Perdue</hi> contains references to the "English Pit" and to pitfalls. All of these—most of them probable—at the very least provide annotation not to be found in the volumes of the Oxford English Novel series.</p>
          <p>Kelly is also right to detect allegorical formulations in <hi rend="i">Anna St. Ives.</hi> A general allegory of class is set up in Sir Arthur’s mania for improvement and his factotum Abimelech Henley’s exploitation of this mania, and the central triangle of Coke Clifton, Anna, and Frank represents values of chivalry, reform, and perhaps nature—"a paradigm of the political situation of the 1790s," says Kelly. Kelly’s most interesting point is that allegorical resonance is achieved by the play on names. He gives us elaborate sources for Coke Clifton and other Holcroft names, but settles down to business with <hi rend="i">Caleb Williams.</hi> Falkland’s name is meant to recall the Lord Falkland of the Civil War (down to the fact that he fought a celebrated duel) and Ferdinando is a particular reference to the "heroic and chivalric King of Spain." We can at least accept Ferdinando as a generally chivalric name, and certainly Godwin, like many of his contemporaries, brought the present conflict into the context of the English Civil War.</p>
          <p>I become less easy when I read that Falkland therefore equals <hi rend="i">ancien-régime</hi> France, and Caleb equals the early moderate reformers of the Revolution—Lafayette and the Girondists, and in particular General Dumouriez, who was "faced with the agonizing decision of having to join France’s enemies and seek her downfall, or leaving the national distemper to run its course." Kelly’s argument gains plausibility from the existence of Dumouriez’ <hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi>, translated by a friend of Godwin’s in 1794. "By attempting to root out the evil of the old feudal regime," writes Kelly, "Caleb Williams, and the French moderates, found they had helped to destroy the whole fabric." This may or may not be; but Kelly’s main points about topicality are convincing, especially as regards the agencies of Pittite oppression finding their reflection in "the kind of social and semi-legal persecution Caleb Williams had to endure for daring to question the integrity of Falkland his employer."</p>
          <p>There is only confirmation in the fact that Goodwin’s fictions after <hi rend="i">Caleb Williams</hi> become ever more allegorical, or that even Inchbald retreats into fable in that "Satire upon the Times" which became <hi rend="i">Nature and Art</hi>, where she translates Pope’s "And wretches hang that jurymen may dine" into the literal scene of William passing sentence of death on his ex-mistress Agnes, who swoons "while he adjourned court to go to dinner." The circumstances that produced <hi rend="i">A Simple Story</hi> and <hi rend="i">Caleb Williams</hi> were unrepeatable, and both writers returned to easier and more conventional ways of dealing with political issues, which themselves became increasingly fuzzy. It is the accomplishment of Kelly’s <hi rend="i">English Jacobin Novel</hi> that we can now see these high points in a clearer relation to contemporary run-of-the-mill novels and plays, to their predecessors, and to the various alternative ways of dealing with the Jacobin experience in fiction.</p>

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>In Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life</hi> we find the record of a conversation between Samuel Palmer and William Blake concerning the <hi rend="i">Job</hi> illustrations. Palmer recollects that he "asked him [Blake] how he would like to paint on glass, for the great west window [of Westminster Abbey], his ‘Sons of God shouting for Joy,’ from his designs in the <hi rend="i">Job.</hi> He said, after a pause, ‘I could do it’ kindling at the thought." (Gilchrist, 1863, I, 303). Almost 150 years after Blake’s death this idea—mutatis mutandis—was finally put into practice, not in Westminster Abbey and not by Blake himself, of course, but on stage at the Frankfurt Schauspielhaus by the scenic designer Erich Wonder. On 5 June 1977 I went to see the first performance of Tankred Dorst and Horst Laube’s new play, <hi rend="i">Goncourt oder: Die Abschaffung des Todes</hi>—itself, I thought, rather disappointing. The stage directions for scene 16, however, demanded the interior of a small Gothic chapel where members of the 1871 Paris Commune were to be seen during one of their last meetings prior to their final defeat, which was inflicted upon them by the troups of the reactionary Thiers. The design for the one "stained glass window" shown in the scenery was taken from Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> watercolors. A giant transparency enlargement of the Butts version of "When the Morning Stars Sang Together" had been cut into the shape of a slightly pointed twelfth-century Gothic window, thus spreading some spiritual comfort and hope on the representation of that otherwise desparate moment in history. Whether Erich Wonder in his stage design did so with or without knowledge of the Blakean context I cannot say. For me—and I hope some others in the audience too—the appearance of that reproduction both meant that the sufferings of the Commune members were related to the sufferings of the Biblical patriarch, and that at the same time there was a promise for their final redemption (which will be ours too).

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>In <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> for spring 1977 it was hinted that two further developments were imminent in the rediscovery of James Jefferys.<ref target="n39" type="note">1</ref> Both have now appeared in the April 1977 issue of <hi rend="i">The Burlington Magazine.</hi> The first article, by John Sunderland, reports the discovery by Timothy Clifford at the close of the Jefferys exhibition that the drawing formerly accepted as a self-portrait from behind by John Hamilton Mortimer in fact shows a figure holding a drawing by Jefferys included in the exhibition.<ref target="n40" type="note">2</ref> It was also clear that the drawing was inscribed in Jefferys’ hand, including the address "To Mr. Benchley," Jefferys’ early patron at Maidstone. The conclusion is that both this drawing, now in the Mellon Collection at Yale, and the companion self-portrait seen from the front, in the National Portrait Gallery, London, are by Jefferys. It is interesting that Sunderland had already suspected that other so-called Mortimers from the same source as these two drawings were not by him; one can now look for a strongly Mortimeresque phase in the development of Jefferys’ very eclectic style. <note id="n39"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Martin Butlin, "The Rediscovery of an Artist: James Jeffreys 1751-1784" in <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi> 40 (Spring 1977), pp. 123-24, two drawings repr.</note><note id="n40"><hi rend="s">2</hi> John Sunderland, "Two Self-Portraits by James Jefferys?" in <hi rend="i">Burlington Magazine</hi>, 119 (April 1977), 279-80, the two drawings repr. p. 281, figs. 76 and 77.</note></p>
          <p>This may be still more eclectic than has been supposed. The other article was by Nancy L. Pressly, identifying Jefferys with the mysterious "Master of the Giants."<ref target="n41" type="note">3</ref> Various attributions to such artists as Prince Hoare have proved untenable and, although Mrs. Pressly’s identification has not yet been whole-heartedly accepted in all quarters, it seems convincing to me. The sketchy treatment of the background figures of the "Master of the Giants" drawings, perhaps more than the more consciously finished foreground figures, seems particularly close to Jefferys’ style; a distinctive manner of drawing kneecaps is a characteristic feature of both groups of drawings! It is good news that Mrs.

Pressly is continuing her study of the activity at Rome in the 1770s of such artists as Fuseli, Sergel, Alexander Runciman, John Brown, Romney and Mauritius Lowe: the <hi rend="i">teribilità</hi>, forceful rather than accomplished, of much of Blake’s work in the 1780s seems to owe as much to these artists’ revival of Mannerism as it does to the more orthodox tenets of Neo-Classicism.
