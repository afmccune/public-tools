                                <figdesc>The two kinds of reproductive prints in the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century were relief and intaglio. In the former, the design
	  is put into relief by cutting what is not part of the design below the surface,
	  and in the latter, designs are incised into metal plates. Woodcut, an example
	  of the former, was the first printing technique, in use by the late 14th
	  century. Engraving, invented in the 15th century, was the first of the intaglio
	  techniques. It requires gravers or burins (figs. 1, 2, C) with
	  wedge-shaped tips for gouging lines into the surface of metal plates, scrapers
	  (figs. 4, 5) to remove the metal forced up by the burin (the
	  burr), and burnishers (figs. 6, 7) to polish lines smooth. A
	  whetstone (fig. D) is used to sharpen the burins. <title level="m">Encyclopédie</title>, 1767. Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</figdesc>

	  and repair plates, a tightly rolled piece of felt and oil (figs. 16, 19) for

	  calipers (fig. 18) to mark the point on the plates verso that needed to

	  mistake. <title level="m">Encyclopédie</title>, 1767. Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</figdesc>

	  the plate is turned on its leather pad while the burin ploughs straight. Unlike
	  drawing, writing, painting, and etching, engraving is nonautographic and a
	  skill requiring years of training. This is why most painters interested in
	  making prints learned etching, a technique in which one uses a needle like a
	  pen and thus drawing skills already acquired, rather than engraving.

	  produce a print and because the resulting line systems were believed (though

	  etching alone and hence superior to the works of the ancient
	  engravers. As an apprentice to James Basire, a master engraver, Blake learned
	  the arts of etching and engraving and excelled in the commercial styles then
	  popular, and though he felt spiritually aligned with the ancient engravers, he
	  did not emulate their practice until late in the last decade of his

	  paradigm, which guided how they made and combined lines and used the white of
	  the paper, the modern engravers had engraving, now centuries old,
	  as their paradigm, which had evolved into a highly artificial, albeit virtuoso,
	  performance in metal in which every part of the design, even the highlights,
	  were enmeshed in a unifying line system. Detail of <title level="m">Orlando Uprooting a Pine</title>, engraved by Blake after Stothard. Essick Collection.</figdesc>

                                <figdesc>Despite their remarkable graphic language and skill,
	  engravers were considered more copyist and craftsman than artist because they
	  were not the inventors of the designs. The muse inspires the artist, pointing
	  to his head as the true origin of the design, which moves from concept to work
	  on paper or canvas and through the reproductive process, through etching (boy
	  agitating the acid) to engraving, a move symbolizing the distance between
	  original and copy. The dismissal of craft or execution as less significant than
	  invention deeply bothered Blake; philosophically, in a platonic aesthetic, this
	  hierarchy and separation extended to the artist as well, since the material
	  artifact could not realize perfectly the idea as originally conceived in the
	  mind. While Blake stated that he copied imagination as others copied nature, he
	  countered this received hierarchy and separation by arguing that invention can
	  only be known as it is executed and that execution generates invention.

These color prints, approximately 40 x 60 cm., brilliantly combine printmaking and painting. Most of the plates were printed twice, with the second impression a little lighter than the first because it was taken from the plate without it being recolored. Most of the plates were reprinted c. 1805. Fitzwilliam Museum.</figdesc>

                                <figdesc>Blake used his rolling press to print relief-etchings, adjusting it so it printed with less pressure. Whereas commercial printers of intaglio plates could use three people in the printing processone handling the press and paper, one for inking the plate, another for wiping ink from the surface of the plateBlake needed only two, since he did not have to wipe the surface of his plates clean of ink. He and his wife probably worked as a team, with Mrs. Blake handling the paper and press and Blake inking the plates and placing them on the bed of the press.

Because the design is in relief and not below the surface, Blake printed his relief etchings with less pressure, which eliminated overt platemarks and enabled him to print on both sides of the sheet and thereby create books with facing pages, a style of printing he used till 1794, when he began printing on one side of the sheet only.</figdesc>
