William Blake and His Circle: A Checklist of Publications and Discoveries in 2010
       
By G. E. Bentley, Jr., with the assistance of Hikari Sato for Japanese publications
       
G. E. Bentley, Jr.’s William Blake and His Circle (1992-), a cumulation (by permission) from Blake,  is now accessible at the web site of the library of Victoria University  in the University of Toronto. He hopes by this time next year (i.e.,  July 2012) to see in print The Edwardses of Halifax: The Making and  Selling of Beautiful Books in London and Halifax 1749-1826 by William,  John, Richard, Thomas, and Specially James Edwards, the Medicean  Bookseller, with Catalogues of Their Publications, 2 vols. (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2012).
       
Addenda and corrigenda to Blake Records, 2nd ed. (2004), now appear online. They are updated yearly in conjunction with the publication of the checklist.

         
   
Blake Publications and Discoveries in 2010
   
Voting    William Blake’s father, James, voted in 1774, 1780, and 1784, his  brother John voted in 1784 and 1788, and his partner, James Parker,  voted in 1788 and 1790 [1] but apparently “the poet himself never voted,” [2]  though he was eligible to do so. This negative evidence has been used  to reinforce the argument that Blake was aloof from practical politics,  despite the fiery political strain in his writings and drawings.  However, Blake did vote, in 1790. [3] Perhaps his political activism should be reappraised.
   
Thomas Owen    Thomas Owen, the boy whom Blake took as an apprentice in June 1788, [4] was probably born in 1775. His possible work under Blake’s direction on the plates for Salzmann’s Elements of Morality (1790-91) is examined by Robert N. Essick (see Salzmann in Part III).
   
The non-English languages recorded for Blake studies in 2010 are  Croatian, Danish, Estonian, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese,  Macedonian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Serbian, Slovenian,  Spanish, and Swedish. In addition, note the number of works published  abroad in English: in Denmark, Germany, India, and Japan.

Reprints     There is a flourishing industry of republishing works related to  Blake whose chief virtue is that they are (deservedly) out of print. The  chief practitioners seem to be Kessinger Publishing, Nabu Press, and  General Books. [8] Note that  the Kessinger editions are mere digital reprints, with, as they admit,  frequent defects. I have seen none of these reprints and confess my  initial incredulity about some, such as the four separate publications  of 18-44 pages into which Emily Hamblen’s On the Minor Prophecies of William Blake (1930) has been divided. However, as each has an ISBN assigned, I take it that they were not only advertised but published.
   
Blake’s Writings
   
The most exciting discovery was the copy of The Mystical Initiations; or, Hymns of Orpheus, translated by Thomas Taylor (1787), with annotations newly identified as Blake’s by Philip and Joseph Cardinale. [9]  This provides a short but fascinating marginalium by Blake and  extensive markings of the text, chiefly underlining. The learned and  tendentious Platonist Thomas Taylor has been fairly reliably associated  with Blake in anecdotes [10] and more speculatively as a major source for his ideas. [11] The discovery of Blake’s annotations to the Hymns of Orpheus,  the only direct evidence that he had read Taylor, will justify a new  investigation of the association and connection of Taylor and Blake.
   
Blake’s long-lost letter of 7 August 1804, known previously only  through catalogue snippets, was acquired in 2009 by Robert N. Essick and  masterfully published in full in 2010 by Mark Crosby and Essick in Blake.  It is an important letter, and the essay about it records a number of  significant discoveries related only rather distantly to the text.
   
The perennial popularity of Songs of Innocence and of Experience  is demonstrated by newly recorded editions of 1988 (in Macedonian),  2009 (in Spanish), and 2010. And Blake’s reviving reputation in the  years before Gilchrist’s epoch-marking biography is indicated by newly  recorded printings of poems in 1839, 1845, 1861, and 1862.
   
Blake’s Art/Commercial Engravings
   
One of Blake’s largest paintings, an inn sign made in 1812 for  Chaucer’s Tabard or Talbot Inn in Southwark, was for the first time  identified and reproduced in 2010. [12]  Alas, under outdoor exposure for two-thirds of a century the picture  deteriorated so extensively that at the end of its lifetime its features  were virtually indistinguishable, and when the building ceased to be an  inn the sign was probably abandoned. The inn sign, as recorded in  contemporary engravings, is disconcertingly different from Blake’s  familiar heroic art, and most Blake students are likely to be made  uneasy by it if not incredulous of its connection with Blake.
   
Beginning about 1800, Blake made a number of miniatures for Hayley and his friends, but some have been lost. [13] Mark Crosby and Robert N. Essick identified for the first time prints of Blake’s lost miniatures of Romney in the European Magazine (1803) and Hayley’s Life of Romney (1809). [14]  The evidence is so plain that it is difficult to understand why they  were not identified long ago. This increases by a third the number of  Blake’s miniatures which have been reproduced.
   
Catalogues and Bibliographies
   
Newly recorded here are dealers’ catalogues of 1843, 1864, 1878,  1879, and 1883 (2), which help to establish the provenances of numbers  of Blake’s works.
   
There were modest exhibitions in 2010 of Blake’s works at the E. J.  Pratt Library of Victoria University in the University of Toronto and  at the Morgan Library and Museum. The Morgan’s formidable publicity  machine secured numerous reviews and notices.
   
Criticism, Biography, and Scholarly Studies
   
Two of the workhorses of Blake scholarship are worthily represented  here in Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2009,” and G. E.  Bentley, Jr., “William Blake and His Circle: A Checklist of Publications  and Discoveries in 2009” (see Blake 43.4 and 44.1 in Part VI).
   
A surprising number of papers on Blake were published in collections of essays: in Blake; Queer Blake, ed. Helen P. Bruder and Tristanne Connolly; Interfaces; Blake in Our Time, ed. Karen Mulhallen; Romanticism and Its Legacies, ed. Ralla Guha Niyogi; Editing and Reading Blake, ed. Wayne C. Ripley and Justin Van Kleeck; and Tate Papers.
   
Among the more permanently valuable of these essays are Angus  Whitehead’s “Mark and Eleanor Martin, the Blakes’ French Fellow  Inhabitants at 17 South Molton Street, 1805-21” (see Blake 43.3 in Part VI) and his “‘Went to see Blake—also to Surgeons college’: Blake and George Cumberland’s Pocketbooks” (see Blake in Our Time, under Mulhallen in Part VI). Whitehead is making wonderful discoveries about Blake’s biographical context.
   
Two other essays in Blake in Our Time are particularly valuable. In 1983, Joseph Viscomi and Thomas V. Lange first reported that two prints in America (B) were not Blake’s originals but imitations [15]  so skillful that they had been taken as genuine by generations of Blake  scholars. In his festschrift essay, “Two Fake Blakes Revisited; One  Dew-Smith Revealed,” Viscomi demonstrates with his customary brilliance  that the inserted plates are photolithographic facsimiles (not fakes)  made between 1874 and 1878 by A. G. Dew-Smith (1848-1903) to perfect his  copy. This is a fascinating conclusion to a bizarre story. In “William  Blake and Chichester,” Morton Paley, following Thomas Wright (1929),  argues plausibly that “the foundations of his [Blake’s] four-gated city  [of Golgonooza] lay in Chichester.”
   
Red Herring
   
According to a “Thought du jour” in the Globe and Mail  [Toronto] 13 Jan. 2010: L6, “‘There is no mistake so great as the  mistake of not going on.’—William Blake.” This phrase is not used in  Blake’s writings or conversations, and I do not know why it should be  foisted on Blake.
   
* * * * * * * * *
   
The annual checklist of scholarship and discoveries concerning  William Blake and his circle records publications and discoveries for  the current year (say, 2010) and those for previous years which are not  recorded in Blake Books, Blake Books Supplement, and “William Blake and His Circle.” Installments of “William Blake and His Circle” are continuations of Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement, with similar principles and conventions.
   
Many of the entries below come from searches in December 2010 for “William Blake” and “2009-2010” in Google (7,470 works), Google Books, Copac (99 works), and WorldCat (684 works).
   
I have made no systematic attempt to record audio books [16] and magazines, blogs, [17] broadcasts on radio and television, calendars, [18] CD-ROMs, chinaware, coffee mugs, [19] comic books, computer printouts (unpublished), conferences, e-mails, festivals and lecture series, furniture, jewelry, [20]  lectures on audiocassettes, lipstick, manuscripts, microforms, mosaics,  movies, murals, music, notebooks (blank), pageants, performances,  pillows, playing cards, podcasts, [21] poems about Blake, portraits, postcards, posters and pictures, [22] recorded readings and singings, [23] refrigerator magnets, stained-glass windows, stamps (postage and rubber), stickers, sweatshirts, T-shirts, [24] tattoos, tiles, typescripts (unpublished), video recordings, and web sites.
   
I take Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement, faute de mieux, to be the standard bibliographical books on Blake, [25] and have noted significant differences from them.
   
The organization of Division I of the checklist is as in Blake Books:
   
          
Division I:
       
William Blake

Part VI:
       
Criticism, Biography, and Scholarly Studies
        
   
Division II: Blake’s Circle [26]
   
This division is organized by individual (say, William Hayley or  John Flaxman), with works by and about Blake’s friends and patrons,  living individuals with whom he had significant direct and demonstrable  contact. It does not include important contemporaries with whom Blake’s  contact was negligible or nonexistent, such as John Constable and  William Wordsworth and Edmund Burke.
   
Reviews, listed here under the book reviewed, are only for works  which are chiefly about Blake, not for those with only, say, a chapter  on Blake. Note that Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement normally do not include reviews.
   
Research for this checklist was carried out particularly in the  libraries of the University of Toronto and Victoria University in the  University of Toronto, Google Books, WorldCat, and Copac, and, for works published in Japan, CiNii (National Institute of Informatics Scholarly and Academic Information Navigator), the National Diet Library online catalogue, Komaba Library and the General Library of the University of Tokyo, and the National Diet Library.
   
I should be most grateful to anyone who can help me to better  information about the unseen (§) items reported here, and I undertake to  thank them prettily in person and in print.
   
For many kinds of favors I thank Noriaki Abe (Subun-So Book Store,  Tokyo), Sandra Burgess (collections manager, Harriet Beecher Stowe  Center), Professor Robert N. Essick, [27]  Professor Alexander Gourlay, Sandra Ho (media relations manager, Morgan  Library), Mary Lynn Johnson (for funky Blake jewelry), Sarah Jones (for  superb fact-checking and editing), Stephen Massil, Dr. Jeffrey Barclay  Mertz, Professor Morton Paley, Ivana Bancevic Pejovic (for a surprising  number of works in Serbian), and Tom Simpson (rare book cataloguer, E.  J. Pratt Library, Victoria University in the University of Toronto).
   
Symbols
   * Works prefixed by an asterisk include one or more illustrations by  Blake or depicting him. If there are more than 19 illustrations, the  number is specified. If the illustrations include all those for a work  by Blake, say Thel or his illustrations to L’ Allegro, the work is identified.   § Works preceded by a section mark are reported on second-hand authority.

Works in Japanese
   
In books printed in the traditional Japanese format, the Japanese  characters are printed in vertical columns, the columns are read from  top to bottom and from the righthand column to those on the left. The  pages are numbered from the righthand end of the book. Text in European  characters in such books is of course printed and read horizontally from  left to right, but the pagination, following the Japanese format, seems  to be backward (see Kobayashi in Part VI).
   
Works in Serbian
   
Note that the poet’s names are given variously (e.g., Blejk,  Blejka, Blejku, Blejkova, Blejkovom) because of the seven different  cases in Serbian.

   Letter, 7 Aug. 1804 (see Letters, below).   
America (1793)
   Copy B   Binding: America (B, printed 1795), probably then lacking pls. 4 and 9, was stabbed through three holes 6.5 and 7.7 cm. apart apparently with Europe (C, printed 1794); America (B) was separated from Europe (C)  by 1799 (when it was inscribed to C. H. Tatham) and probably sewn  through three new stabholes 10.7, 12.9 cm. apart; it was presumably in  this state, or possibly unstitched, when sold “unbound” in 1874; by 1878  it was “BOUND BY F. BEDFORD” in citron morocco and, after being bound  thus, excellent photolithographic facsimiles of pls. 4 and 9 [28]  (probably copied by its owner, A. G. Dew-Smith, from copy F in the  British Museum), marked “F” (?for “Facsimile”), were tipped in at the  appropriate places to perfect the copy. [29]   
Copy R   History: “Almost certainly” [30] this is the copy of Edward Vernon Utterson with 18 pls. “printed in tints” (like America  [R] in blue and green) in the Sotheby sale of 5 July 1852, lot 251  [sold for £2.7.0 (?to James Holmes)]; Quaritch offered it in Oct. 1883  for £36 (see Part IV) and in his General Catalogue (1886), lot 29489 (printed in blue, bound in half morocco, gilt edges), for £42.

In “Very Important New Books” (added to works  published by John Camden Hotten, 1868 ff.) is an advertisement for  “Original Edition of Blake’s Works.”

As it is only intended to produce—with utmost care—a few examples of  each work, Mr. Hotten will be glad to hear from any gentleman who may  desire to secure copies of these wonderful books. The first volume, “Marriage of Heaven and Hell,” 4to, is now being issued, price 30s., half morocco. [quotation from Charles Lamb]
   No other facsimile was issued in this series.   
In Quaritch’s New Catalogue of Miscellaneous Works  (1876), lot [16078], the [Camden Hotten] facsimile is dated “(1871)  Only 100 copies of this facsimile were printed, and of these only 25  copies were coloured.”

Facsimile Pages ﻿see BB p. 345﻿
   
The clearest type differences between the original and  the type-facsimile are the omission of the catchword (“THE” for “THE |  COUCH OF DEATH”) at the foot of p. 59 and the misprint “honſte-ſeeming”  for “honeſt-ſeeming” on p. 65 (“Samson”) of the facsimile.
   
In the facsimile leaves is a watermark “MICHALLET”  (not present in copy K), and the vertical chain lines are 2.8 cm. apart,  as in the original paper. However, the chain lines are much fainter in  the facsimile than in the original, and the facsimile paper seems to be a  trifle thicker. In copy K, the same thicker paper is used for the blank  leaves adjacent to the text.

A unique, very Blakean watercolor “Title Page by Wm  Muir” was commissioned and paid for (£1.5.0, June 1889), presumably by  “HENRY MARTIN GIBBS | of Barrow Court Flax Bourton | Co. Somerset”,  whose bookplate appears in the volume, to accompany Muir’s facsimiles of  Innocence, Experience, Visions, Thel, Marriage, Milton, There is No Natural Religion, Gates of Paradise, and Urizen, bound by Zaehnsdorf (1890, £7.10.0). [39] It omits America, Europe, The Song of Los, On Homer, and “Little Tom.”

“A List of Books Published by Chatto and Windus” (London, Dec. 1874) [42] advertises
   
Blake’s Works. Messrs. Chatto and Windus have in preparation a series of Reproductions in Facsimile of the Works of William Blake,  including the “Songs of Innocence and [of] Experience,” “The Book of  Thel,” “America,” “The Vision[s] of the Daughters of Albion,” [43]  “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,” “Europe, a Prophecy,” “Jerusalem,”  “Milton,” “Urizen,” “The Song of Los,” andc. These Works will be  issued both coloured and plain. (36)
   
The same works were named and a quotation from Charles  Lamb added in “A List of Books Published by Chatto and Windus”  (n.d.) [44] and in the Chatto and Windus “List of Books” (Oct. 1876), [45] omitting the Lamb quotation.
   
This seems to be the Works by William Blake, reproduced from copies of Blake’s poems in the British Museum. However, there are important differences. Works by William Blake omits Milton, Jerusalem, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, and “andc,” it was not colored, and the individual poems were not separately issued in “a series.” Marriage  was probably omitted because it had been reproduced in 1868 by John  Camden Hotten, whose stock was taken over by Chatto and Windus. [46]  Further, the Chatto and Windus lists do not suggest that the work was  “for Private Circulation.” And after 1876 “Blake’s Works” no longer  appeared in Chatto and Windus lists, though Swinburne’s William Blake: A Critical Essay (London: Chatto and Windus, 1868) was advertised in all these lists.
   
Chatto and Windus had 100 sets of “Blake reproductions” printed on 17 Nov. 1877 and bound on 26 Jan. 1878 BBS p. 169﻿. Plainly the Works by William Blake dated 1876 was not ready for distribution until 1878.
   
Jerusalem was probably omitted because an uncolored facsimile was published by John Pearson in 1877 BBS p. 88﻿.

Newly Recorded Title
   
§European Magazine, and London Review 43 (Apr. 1803)
   
The oval frontispiece of “George Romney, Esq.r”  engraved by William Ridley of Romney’s self-portrait probably derives  from Blake’s miniature copied from the self-portrait for Hayley, not  from Romney’s original (then belonging to Hayley, now in the National  Portrait Gallery, London). The evidence is persuasively laid out by Mark  Crosby and Robert N. Essick, “‘the fiends of Commerce’” (see Blake 44.2 in Part VI).

Hayley, William, The Life of George Romney (1809)
   
Ordinary copies of Hayley’s Romney have a  printed spine label reading “LIFE | OF | G. ROMNEY | — | HAYLEY”  ﻿Essick﻿, but that on large-paper copies reads “HAYLEY’S | LIFE | of | ROMNEY. | Illustrated | WITH | TWELVE PLATES | BY | CAROLINE WATSON ” ﻿Essick﻿, though she engraved only 7 of them.
   
Newly Recorded Engraving after Blake
   
In Caroline Watson’s frontispiece of three  self-portraits of Romney, the small oval one at bottom representing  Romney wearing a hat is probably copied from Blake’s lost miniature  (Mark Crosby and Robert N. Essick, “‘the fiends of Commerce’” [see Blake 44.2 in Part VI] 64).

   *[Karen Mulhallen]. Remember Me! Blake in Our Time: A Keepsake  Book in Celebration of an Exhibition and Symposium on the Life and Art  of William Blake (1757-1827) [at] Victoria University, Toronto. [Toronto: Victoria University, 2010]. Horizontal 8o, 64 pp., 38 reproductions, 61 exhibits; ISBN: 9780986707100.   
The exhibition focuses particularly on works acquired  since the gift (2005) of the Bentley Collection of Blake and his  contemporaries (see the Victoria University exhibition of 30 Oct.-15  Dec. 2006 Blake (2007)﻿), including the extra-illustrated Bray, Life of Thomas Stothard (1851) (see pp. 13, 22, 24-25), Diario de los niños (1839-40) (pp. 16-17), Varley, Zodiacal Physiognomy  (1828) (pp. 18-19), Stothard, “The Fall of Rosamond” (1783) (pp.  22-23), Watteau, “Morning [and] Evening Amusement” (1782) (pp. 26-28),  Morland, “The Idle Laundress” and “The Industrious Cottager” (pp.  29-31), “Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims” (1810) (pp. 34, 36-37), “Spring”  (pp. 46-47), and Remember Me! (1824, two copies, one with the rare color-printed slipcase) (pp. 52-55).  Marriage (M) is reproduced entire.
   
The undated draft letter by William Hayley addressed to “Dear Poet and Philosopher” (laid into a copy of Hayley’s Triumphs of Temper  [1803]) was almost certainly sent to Erasmus Darwin, not “to William  Blake” (p. 21). The letter recommends “my excellent friend Flaxman who  is just returned [in 1794] from Rome” as a sculptor for a monument to  Wedgwood (Flaxman’s monument to Wedgwood is in Stoke-on-Trent church).
   
The exhibition and catalogue were associated with Blake  in Our Time: A Symposium Celebrating the Future of Blake Studies and  the Legacy of G. E. Bentley Jr (28 Aug. 2010), organized by Karen  Mulhallen, and the launch of Blake in Our Time: Essays in Honour of G. E. Bentley Jr, ed. Karen Mulhallen (see Part VI).

Payne and Son, at the Mews-gate; L. | Davis, Holborn; B. White and Son, Fleet-ſtreet; and | G. Nichol, Strand. 1787. [64]   Location: Bodleian Library, Arch. H e.181.   History: Offered “newly bound in calf ” at £2.2.0 in Bernard Quaritch’s Catalogue (no. 414) (London, Feb. 1928); [65]  “Bt. from Quaritch” (according to an inscription on the front  pastedown) by the Bodleian Library, where it was stamped 29 Sept. 1928.  Its Blake associations were first noticed by Philip Cardinale in 2001  and recorded by Philip and Joseph Cardinale in Blake 44.3 (winter 2010-11): 84-102, the source of almost all the information here.   Binding: Bound, probably in 1928, in brown calf.   Annotations and underlinings: There are annotations on pp. vii-viii  and 69, corrections of printer’s errors on pp. 89 and 225, and  underscoring and sidebars on pp. iv-v, vii-viii, 1-3, 5-6, 9-10, 14-15,  19-22, 26-28, 30, 44-47, 68, 70-72, 75-76, 78-79, 84, and 97. “All the  handwriting and most of the underlining … appear in orange-brown ink;  some underlining and markings are in a darker, brown-black shade of ink.  Pencil marks appear on pages 14, 30, 44, 68, 70, and 97” (Cardinale and  Cardinale 85). The only extensive note says:  
There is no instance of a poet writing good Eng.  Blank verse who has not also written good  Rhyme: but many have written good rhyme  who have shewn no capability of writing. good  Blank verse —
   Handwriting: Minute comparison with An Island in the Moon (?1784-85)  strongly suggests that the hand which wrote the annotations in Taylor’s  book is that of William Blake, and the two inks used in underlining are  much like those Blake used. The identification of Blake as the creator  of the pencil marks is much more speculative but still plausible.   
There were reviews in Critical Review 63 (June 1787): 401-06; Town and Country Magazine 19 (July 1787): 293; European Magazine, and London Review  12 (July 1787): 18-19 (5s.; “Mr. Taylor hath displayed no common  erudition”; “we warmly recommend the ‘Dissertation’”; “though Mr. Taylor  may not be ranked very high as a poetical translator, he may be placed  in no inferior station among the proficients in abstruser literature”); Monthly Review 79 (Aug. 1788): 133-42.

A copy is inscribed in ink in “the same juvenile hand”  on the front and rear pastedowns “a a Blake” and “W Blake.” Robert N.  Essick, to whom the work was offered in Nov. 2010 by Maggs, concludes  that it is “very unlikely that these inscriptions … are by the poet and  artist.” [66] Let us  assume charitably that they are by one of the host of contemporary  individuals named “William Blake” or “W. Blake.” [67]

The attack in the Cheltenham Examiner, 4 Sept. 1839, assumes that the new edition of Blake’s Songs  is “a fair specimen of what ‘Swedenborgianism’ truly is.” A reply by “A  Swedenborgian” is in the issue for 18 Sept., but it does not point out  “that Swedenborg and his doctrines are in no degree answerable for the  phantasies and absurdities of Blake,” whose “childish” poems should be  called “Songs of Silliness and Diseased Perception.”

The *painting (1812) is the inn sign, perhaps 6' x  8', for the courtyard of the Talbot (formerly Tabard) Inn in Southwark  representing “Chaucer and his merry Company setting out [from the inn]  on their journey” to Canterbury. The sign, visible for 60 years, was  repeatedly described and ascribed to Blake in the nineteenth century,  but has been forgotten since then. Another painting hung “over the  gateway” representing Chaucer may also have been by Blake.

Malmberg, one of Sweden’s foremost art critics, argues  that gold in the illuminated books is, in M. H. Abrams’s sense, both  mirror and lamp. Contrasting the use of gold in a medieval illumination  on the one hand and in an early painting by Ingres on the other,  Malmberg shows that gold often does not have symbolic meaning in Blake’s  works (he adduces the gold in the Jerusalem pl. 59 design,  where the daughters labor at wheels, “Terrible their distress”), but is  there for its own sake, its own existence, and that, while it may have  symbolic meaning at times, there are important places where gold=gold.

   Karen Mulhallen. “Introduction.” 3-15. (“G. E. Bentley Jr almost  single-handedly shifted the focus of Blake criticism from formalism and  symbolism to the ‘Minute Particulars’ of Blake’s life and work” [3].)

(A masterful survey of  the “symbiotic relationship” between Blake collecting and Blake  scholarship.)   2. *Joseph Viscomi. “Two Fake Blakes Revisited; One Dew-Smith Revealed.” 35-78. (A brilliant demonstration that America  [B] pls. 4, 9 are photolithographic facsimiles [not fakes] made between  1874 and 1878 by A. G. Dew-Smith [1848-1903], an admirable photographer  and commercial lithographer, and each marked by him “F” [?for  “Facsimile”] to perfect his copy.)   3. *Joyce H. Townsend and Bronwyn A. Ormsby. “Blake’s Painting  Materials, Technical Art History, and the Legacy of G. E. Bentley Jr.”  79-92. (“This paper discusses the motives that inspired our research  into … Blake’s output, the way it developed, and its findings in the  context of other technical studies on Blake” [80].)   
Part Two: “For Friendship’s Sake”: Friends and Patrons
   4. David Bindman. “New Light on the Mathews: Flaxman and Blake’s Early  Gothicism.” 95-104. (Inscriptions by A. S. Mathew on early Flaxman  drawings of Gothic subjects, especially for Chatterton, “strongly  suggest that Mathew was directly involved in Flaxman’s early attempts at  illustrating Chatterton” [96].)   5. *Mark Crosby. “‘a Ladys Book’: Blake’s Engravings for Hayley’s The Triumphs of Temper.” 105-30. (“Blake’s six plates were not reprinted in the second  thirteenth edition” [i.e., the second state of the thirteenth edition],  partly because the copperplates had become very worn [106].)   6. Mary Lynn Johnson. “More on Blake’s (and Bentley’s) ‘White Collar  Maecenas’: Thomas Butts, His Wife’s Family of Artisans, and the  Methodist Withams of St. Bartholomew the Great.” 131-64. (A densely  factual and original essay only occasionally related to Blake. The  parents of Thomas Butts were married by John Wesley.)   7. Angus Whitehead. “‘Went to see Blake—also to Surgeons college’:  Blake and George Cumberland’s Pocketbooks.” 165-200. (On 3 June 1820  George Cumberland “Went to see Blake” and perhaps took him “to introduce  [him?] to Mr [William] Clift,” the distinguished curator of the  Hunterian Museum in the Royal College of Surgeons, and to discuss with  Clift the purchase of a fossil.)   8. *Martin Butlin. “George Richmond, Blake’s True Heir?” 201-12. (Richmond is Blake’s artistic heir, especially in his Creation of Light [1826].)   
Part Three: “What I Both See and Hear”: Architecture and Industry
   9. *Morton D. Paley. “William Blake and Chichester.” 215-32. (“The  foundations of his [Blake’s] four-gated city [of Golgonooza] lay in  Chichester” [219].)   10. Keri Davies. “William Blake and the Straw Paper Manufactory at  Millbank.” 233-61. (The first European straw paper mill was built at  Millbank in 1801 by Matthias Koops [who had been declared bankrupt in  1790] and was declared bankrupt in 1803, which ruined Richard Twiss [d.  1821], who owned Blake’s For Children.)   Jerome McGann. “Epilogue: A Memorable Fancy.” 262-64. (The Prolific Giant in Marriage  pls. 16-17 is GEB, or rather “all those books and essays turned out  from his Printing House in Hell: clearing away rubbish, building and  decorating immense bibliographical palaces …” [263].)   *Robert Brandeis. “Appendix: William Blake in Toronto: The Bentley  Collection at Victoria University Library.” 265-72. (The essay  “outline[s] the extent of the [Bentleys’ bibliophilic] infection and its  ultimate successful ‘comforting cure’” in giving the collection to the  Victoria University Library [265].)

“Illuminated Poems” consists of reproductions on glossy paper of (1) Blake’s America copperplate fragment [71] with one sentence of text saying that “now, in 1947, an experimenting poet [Todd] and two artists [S. W. Hayter [72]  and Joan Miró] have rediscovered Blake’s antique printing method and  are making Illuminated Poems” (72); (2) “The Engraver for Bill Hayter,”  with decorations which look like Aboriginal designs (73); (3) “The Glass  Tower,” undecorated (74); (4) “An Alien World for Dolores Miró,” with  curious unsigned pasted-on colored designs [by her father, Joan Miró]  (75).
   
According to “The Tale of the Contents” (56), from  which the title derives, Todd “is preparing a new book William Blake,  The Mental Prince. [73] He has written a full account of Blake’s method that will be printed in a technical magazine.” [74]

Review
   Anon., “Domestic Literature. For the Year 1793,” New Annual Register … for the Year 1793 (1794): 194-277. ﻿Harvard﻿   
“Lewina, the Maid of Snowdon, a Tale, and a Poem on the  Landscapes of Great Britain, by George Cumberland,” are productions of  very different merits. The former is simple, and occasionally pathetic  and interesting, but frequently insipid and unpoetical. The latter,  which is far from being faultless in point of diction and rhyme,  discovers considerable powers of description, and liveliness of fancy;  and shews that the author possesses a sensible, cultivated mind. With  greater attention to correctness, and to avoid too familiar and prosaic  phraseology, the author may rise to eminence in descriptive poetry.  These poems are elegantly printed, and are accompanied with etchings by  the author, from his own original drawings. (271-72)

Easson and Essick, William Blake Book Illustrator: A Bibliography and Catalogue of the Commercial Engravings,  vol. 1: Plates Designed and Engraved by Blake (Normal: American Blake  Foundation, 1972); vol. 2: Plates Designed or Engraved by Blake  1774-1796 (Memphis: American Blake Foundation, 1979); vol. 3 never  appeared. The standard authority for prints issued separately is Essick,  The Separate Plates of William Blake: A Catalogue (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983).
   
26. There is nothing in Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement corresponding to Division II.
   
27. Especially for his “Blake in the Marketplace, 2010” typescript, despite its distressing entries for “not in BB or BBS.” Essick’s discoveries were communicated to me in Dec. 2010 and printed in Blake 44.4 (spring 2011): 116-42.
   
28. While pls. 4 and 9  were missing, the prints were numbered 2-16 in pencil by an unknown hand  on pls. 2-3, 5-8, 10-18 below the bottom-left platemark. (BBS  p. 54n23 erroneously describes the first numeration as “Blake’s  page-numbers.”) Pls. 1-18 (including the facsimile pls. 4 and 9) were  later correctly numbered 1-18 at the top-right corner of the leaf by a  Quaritch assistant.
   
29. The new information here about numeration and facsimiles derives from Joseph Viscomi, “Two Fake Blakes Revisited” (see Blake in Our Time, under Mulhallen in Part VI). BBS p. 54 suggests erroneously that pls. 4 and 9 were added after 1878.
   
30. Viscomi, “Two Fake Blakes Revisited” (see Blake in Our Time, under Mulhallen in Part VI) 43. It is probably not copy B as in BBS.
   
31. BR(2) 758. Flaxman was in Italy 1787-94 when For Children was published.
   
32. According to Mark Crosby and Robert N. Essick, “‘the fiends of Commerce’” (see Blake 44.2  in Part VI) 54, “A large watermark in the center of the full sheet  shows a shield with a horn within, the shield surmounted by a crown and  with a finial at its lower termination. Below these motifs is an  elaborate JW cipher that identifies the paper as Whatman …. The chain  lines are 2.4 cm. apart.”
   
33. It was first(?) printed in the account of “the collection of Blake’s works in Mr. Macgeorge’s possession,” Thomas Mason, Public and Private Libraries of Glasgow (Glasgow: Thomas D. Morison, 1885) 291-93.
   
34. Not “Charlot” (a publisher, not a place) as in BB #111B.
   
35. The title page is dated “MCMXXIII,” but the colophon (p. 65) says it was printed “a Abbeville, le XXX Novembre MCMXXII.”
   
36. Anon., “Fine Arts Record,” Fine Arts Quarterly Review 1 (Oct. 1863): 434-35. Geoffrey Keynes, Engravings by William Blake: The Separate Plates: A Catalogue Raisonné  (Dublin: Emery Walker, 1956) 6, says George A. Smith (who sold the  collection in 1880) collected the contents of the volume “about 1853,”  and Keynes, A Bibliography of William Blake (New York: Grolier  Club, 1921) 319, cites “a prefatory note signed ‘G. A. S. 1855’” (which  is not now with the collection). However, the references in Puttick and  Simpson (1863) and Quaritch (1864) contradict this history for the  1850s. Note also that the sketch of Thomas Hayley (no. 99 among the “Order” materials, BB  p. 339) is probably the “Portrait of Hayley the Sculptor” (Butlin #345,  now in the Yale Center for British Art) sold at Sotheby’s, 29 Apr.  1862, lot 178 (with 7 others, including the portrait of Romney, Butlin  #349).
   
37. BB p. 405, silently following Geoffrey Keynes and Edwin Wolf, 2nd, William Blake’s Illuminated Books: A Census  (New York: Grolier Club, 1953), identifies R. H. Clarke as “the son of  Hayley’s friend J. S. Clarke [1765?-1834].” However, Stephen Massil of  the Garrick Club Library (London) tells me that R. H. Clarke does not  appear in the will of James Stanier Clarke or in that of his widow. The  identification of the Blake collector as the son of J. S. Clarke  therefore seems implausible. He is probably Robert Henry Clarke  (1818-1906), son of Henry and Margaret Clarke, baptized Mar. 1818 at  Manchester Square Wesleyan Church, St. Marylebone, recorded as “clerk in  stationers” in the 1881 census, and buried Jan. 1906 at Camberwell Old  Cemetery.
   
38. The information is from Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2010,” Blake 44.4 (spring 2011): 131.
   
39. The complete set of  Muir facsimiles was offered by John Windle, Mar. 2010; the prices and  dates here derive from an inventory, presumably by Gibbs, which  accompanies the volume.

44. It is bound with Edward Lee Childe, The Life and Campaigns of General Lee (London: Chatto and Windus, 1875) ﻿Michigan﻿ and with other Chatto and Windus publications of 1875 and 1876.

47. From 2010 I record pre-1863 references to separately issued prints.
   
48. The information derives from Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2010,” Blake 44.4 (spring 2011): 131.
   
49. The sales records  specify Blake, 12 or 13 engravings or etchings, Schiavonetti, quarto,  and £2.12.6 for both 1808 and 1813 editions, unless otherwise noted. The  quarto is sometimes qualified as “royal” (Eclectic Review, Edinburgh Review),  “atlas” (Ackermann ?1813, 1815, 1816, 1818, 1824, 1828), “elephant”  (Ackermann 1815, 1816, Eastburn 1818, Carey 1818, Ackermann 1821-22,  Eastburn 1822, Ackermann 1824), or “large elephant” (Ackermann ?1813,  1818).
   
50. Biographie universelle, ancienne et moderne, vol. 41 (Paris: L. G. Michaud, 1825) 124, lists Blair’s Grave (1813) in the entry on Schiavonetti. Ideen zur Kunst-Mythologie,  ed. Julius Sillig, vol. 2 (Dresden: in der Arnoldischen Buchhandlung,  1836) 506n (in German), also refers to the 1813 edition (“der geistvolle  Zeichner Blake in seinen Kupfern zu Blairs Grave …”) and describes  three scenes. ﻿Michigan﻿ Note that Ackermann had plainly purchased not only the copperplates and  copyright but the remainder of the copies of the 1808 edition.
   
51. See BB p. 533.
   
52. A copy with “proofs on India paper, russia” was listed in the Catalogue of the Splendid, Choice, and Curious Library of P. A. Hanrott, Esq. Part the First … Sold by Auction, by Mr. Evans, 16 July 1833 and 11 days, lot 630 (to “Anh[?]” for £2.6.0). ﻿British Library﻿
   
53. The title given in the Ackermann list (1815) for the “First Edition” (1808)—“with Biographical Accounts of Blair, Schiavonetti, and Cromek”—is in fact that of the 1813 second edition (“to which is added a life of the author”), and BB p. 533 mistakenly associates the advertisement with the second edition.
   
54. Advertisements and notices are included only when they specify “engraved by J. Blake.”
   
55. The information derives from Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2010,” Blake 44.4 (spring 2011): 142.

59. The advertisement was pointed out to me by Mark Crosby. Advertisements in the Oracle for 13-14 Jan. and 6 Feb. were already recorded.
   
60. Copy Y is the newly recorded copy owned by Robert N. Essick.

a. What I have called “diary” is headed “KALENDAR and ALBUM 1825.” All after p. 336 (the diary) is missing from Cambridge copy 3, Morgan, National Library of Wales copies 2-3, and New York Public Library, as in the issue of 1825. In addition, the date has been erased from the title page in Cambridge copy 3 and National Library of Wales copies 2-3, and the engraved title page with the date is missing from the Morgan copy. All these were presumably issued in 1825.
 
b. Cambridge copy 1 is bound in light-green grained morocco with black tooling round the edges of the boards, gilt tooling on the spine, and a brown title label on the spine with gilt lettering. For the copies now in Cambridge, see BB #490 and BBS p. 247.
 
c. In Cambridge copy 6, the boards and spine are decorated in gilt with a red title label on the spine.
 
d. Essick copy 1, acquired from Douglas Cleverdon, is described in Geoffrey Keynes, Blake Studies, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971) 144.
 
e. The Essick copy is bound in dark-red morocco, with gilt and blind decorations and “REMEMBER | ME” on the spine; Essick is fairly certain that it is a publisher’s binding.
 
f. The Harvard (Houghton) copy, reproduced online http://nrs.harvard.edu.libproxy.lib.unc.edu/urn-3:HUL.FIG:003640386, shows the cover of dark-red pebble-grain cloth.
 
g. The Huntington copy lacks pp. 153-60.
 
h. The Morgan copy is inscribed “W. M. Rossetti from Swinburne 1878.”
 
i. With extraordinary generosity, Timothy Cutts of the National Library of Wales Rare Book Unit wrote me that
 
The copy is sewn on three recessed cords laced into boards with a tight back, covered in full embossed purple skiver [soft thin sheepskin]. The headbands are sewn in blue and white thread. The spine is lettered in gold with four gilded panels, and the borders of the boards are tooled with an ornamental gold fillet line.
 
j. National Library of Wales copy 2 has the date rubbed off the title page, and it has been rebound in a dark-green case binding with “1831” tooled in gold on the spine. There are no diary pages, and the copy ends at p. 336.  The name W. H. Davey has been scratched on the upper cover.
   
k. National Library of Wales copy 3 comes from the library of Francis William Bourdillon (1852-1921), poet, literary scholar, and bibliographer, of Midhurst, Sussex.
 
l. In the copy in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library, beneath the green cover of the sleevecase is red paper.
 
m. Victoria University copy 1 (formerly Essick’s) lacks pp. 73-74 (f. E1).

Reviewed by Christopher Rowland
         
Christopher Rowland (christopher.rowland@queens.ox.ac.uk)  is Dean Ireland’s Professor of the Exegesis of Holy Scripture in the  University of Oxford. He has written widely on Christian origins and the  history of apocalypticism in Christianity. He has just completed a book  on Blake and the Bible (Yale University Press, 2011).

This concise study of Blake’s religion starts  from the recent work done on Blake’s Moravian background and the  possible overlaps between Moravianism and Swedenborgianism. In the  process, it seeks to elucidate what is meant by Blake’s radicalism,  which, as the author points out, is a very slippery concept. The book  starts with a rejection of E. P. Thompson’s theory that Blake’s mother  was a Muggletonian and a consideration of the links with Unitarianism,  Swedenborgianism, and Moravianism, but these last two loom largest, as  they do throughout the rest of the book. The following chapter considers  Blake’s religion, moving from a treatment of some of the poems in  Blake’s Notebook via the apocalyptic passages in The Four Zoas to Milton and Jerusalem.  There are interesting comments on the powerfully effective  juxtaposition of sex and religion, which gives some of Blake’s lines  such a radical feel. Ankarsjö explores Blake’s use of apocalyptic  religion, especially the sense of climactic unity as male and female are  united in the entry into Paradise. The chapter ends with a suggestion  that the emphasis on the forgiveness of sins might be explained by  Blake’s temptation to have an amorous affair with Nancy Flaxman, leading  to his very personal interest in forgiveness.

Ankarsjö explores the intertwining of sex and  religion more thoroughly in the central chapter on Blake’s sexuality,  which considers sexual elements throughout the Blake corpus. Here the  supposed Moravian influence is especially brought out, with some  interesting comments made about familiar poems, not least the  “challenging and daring” “I Saw a Chapel All of Gold” (75-76), as well  as the preoccupation with the blood of Christ (John 19.34), found  particularly in “The Grey Monk.” Echoes of Moravian and Swedenborgian  material are traced in Visions of the Daughters of Albion. As  already noted, eschatological union is a feature of Blake’s later major  works, echoing the kind of climax that we find in the Book of Revelation  in the New Testament. In some ways the material here retraces issues  that the author has already enunciated in considering Blake’s religion.  The final chapter, entitled “Blake’s Utopian ‘Colony,’” looks at plans  to set up a Swedenborgian utopian community in Sierra Leone, with a mix  of sexual and utopian idealism, reflected in The Book of Thel,  though with Blake’s rejection of the patriarchal overtones. Throughout  the book, the Swedenborgian elements that Ankarsjö identifies in the  later works are less compelling than those found in the early ones.

Despite its somewhat discursive style, this book  is an interesting read, not least in exploring neglected areas of the  Blake corpus to show how Swedenborgianism and Moravianism may have  influenced Blake’s mental world. The definition of radicalism emerges  from the content of the book and is focused on the attitude towards  sexual issues. This may be a component of Blake’s religion, but it does  not by any means represent its entirety, and it would have been helpful  to see whether the various strands of antinomian biblical interpretation  support the views taken in the book. We know from the history of  apocalypticism that for centuries thinkers have appropriated apocalyptic  images in order to understand individual psychological development. In  early Christian interpretation of Revelation we find interpreters like  Methodius and Tyconius relating the images either to the religious life  of the individual or the struggle of the ecclesial community. Such  elements have their echoes in Blake’s work. The impact of this kind of  understanding in terms of wider society could have been brought out  more, rather than being confined to the final chapter on utopianism. The  book’s title seems to promise a broad review of Blake and religion, but  in effect what we get is a rather narrowly focused discussion that  omits key aspects of Blake’s concerns (the Bible, for example, and his  understanding of the person of Christ). Of course, the treatment of  sexual matters itself points to Blake’s radicalism as far as religion is  concerned. The maintenance of taboos about sex and gender is one of the  key features of any religion, not least the mainstream Christianity  against which Blake reacted.

In affirming the importance of the discovery of  Blake’s Moravian antecedents and exploring the implications for his  religion, Ankarsjö makes some pertinent points and offers a useful  digest of the state of play of neglected elements in the study of  Blake’s religious background. Students will find the summary chapter on  Unitarianism, Swedenborgianism, and Moravianism helpful. Ankarsjö  reminds us of the often mysterious and complex religious world from  which Blake emerged and to which he reacted, much of which remained in  his theological bloodstream.

Philippa Simpson (philippa.simpson@tate.org.uk)  is assistant curator (nineteenth century) at Tate Britain, and has  curated a number of displays on Blake, including Blake and Physiognomy  and Blake and the Romantic Imagination. Her research is focused on  exhibition culture and the idea of the British School in the early  nineteenth century, and she was cocurator of Turner and the Masters.

The title of the 2009 Petit Palais exhibition and  its accompanying catalogue offers an extraordinarily loaded and complex  epithet: “The Visionary Genius of English Romanticism.” Both the show  and the book, an illustrated collection of essays and other reactions  written in or translated into French, were clearly shaped by the need to  (re)introduce Blake to a French audience. As is pointed out more than  once in the book, there had been no major exhibition of Blake’s art in  the country since 1947. Indeed, for the second half of the twentieth  century Blake’s reputation had rested largely on his writings, which  were repeatedly translated, and were championed by a number of French  cultural heroes, including Pierre Berger and André Gide. At the Petit  Palais, by reuniting series of drawings, prints, and paintings,  attention was focused instead upon the processes involved in Blake’s  image-making and his role as a visual artist, not to overturn but to  augment the received perception of him as a writer.

Initially the text seems not only to support but  to develop these aims. Following Daniel Marchesseau’s overview of  Blake’s place in the French cultural consciousness—a necessary act of  reflection that prepares the ground for further interrogation of his  work—comes a piece of poetic prose by Yves Bonnefoy. When confronted  with this dynamic personal response, we may suspect that the aim of the  catalogue is to eulogize Blake rather than to examine his works with any  critical rigor, but this would be a false impression. Coming directly  after Bonnefoy’s lyrical descriptions, Michael Phillips’s précis of  Blake’s career offers a revealing counterpoint in its clear and  authoritative outline of the social, historical, and cultural conditions  under which Blake created his works. It soon becomes apparent that it  was wise to insert this more conventional introductory essay after  Bonnefoy’s more subjective interpretative text. The two essays are  delicately balanced, and illustrate nicely the difficulties involved in  staging any exhibition of Blake’s work. Phillips’s intricate technical  knowledge complements and enriches Bonnefoy’s more emotive portrait of  the artist, adding a sense of wonder at Blake’s practical innovation to  an admiration of his imagination. Furthermore, by reminding the reader  of the laborious process of mediation between the conception of the  artist and the production of the work, Phillips challenges the notion of  a visionary experience directly recorded, without diminishing in any  way the reputation of the artist.

Parallels between Blake’s philosophies and his  techniques are suggested, laying a constructive foundation for new  viewers to reflect upon these correspondences in the diverse works on  display. The correspondence between the act of cutting or biting into  the plate and Blake’s notion of man’s innate knowledge is used to  illustrate the intimate connection between his practice and his attitude  towards the rationalist theories of Locke and Newton. Phillips deals  with the allegorical nature of Blake’s techniques most evocatively,  however, in relation to Songs of Innocence and of Experience.  Describing with great delicacy the process of printing these poems, he  suggests that the transparent quality of the medium allowed reflected  light to shine through from the paper beneath, recalling the notion of  the divine image in man, and lending a new meaning to the phrase  “illuminated printing.”

Occasionally Phillips’s descriptions of Blake’s  radical innovations in printmaking are oversimplified, and succumb to  the myth of the artist as an isolated genius, born before his time. But  in general, by locating precedents for Blake’s images, emphasizing the  sheer industry involved in their construction, and outlining the  pressures—artistic and financial—experienced by the artist, Phillips  provides the viewer with a contextual framework that is enabling rather  than restrictive.

This, though, is where the catalogue begins to  lose its way as a means of introducing these works by Blake to the  French. The text might easily have been confined to something like these  first three essays, within which much of the information in the later  material might have been incorporated (Céline Mansanti’s useful survey  of Blake’s reception in France, for example, or David Steel’s work on  Blake and André Gide). It would then have been sufficient simply to  reproduce all the exhibited works, dividing these into smaller isolated  series, tracing a broad overarching narrative of Blake’s career as seen  in the exhibition itself. This would have given a clearer shape and  identity to the catalogue as a whole, by virtue of both a loose  chronology and at least an element of visual and thematic structure.  Instead, there are twenty-six short essays, ranging from around 1500 to  3000 words, each focusing tightly on one issue—aesthetic, contextual,  iconographic—relating to Blake’s practice. With so great a range of  authors and subjects some repetition is inevitable, but it is hard to  excuse the large overlaps among several of the essays. Most striking,  and unfortunate, are the echoes between Phillips’s introduction and the  text by Martin Butlin that immediately succeeds it, but these are only  the first of many. By the third description of Blake’s visit to  Westminster Abbey, the reader could be forgiven for skimming the  remaining twenty or so entries.

This is not to say that the texts are  uninteresting. Many of the themes are well selected and the writing is  often illuminating, helping to contextualize Blake’s work without simply  inserting it into conventional histories. Bethan Stevens, for example,  provides a sophisticated analysis of Visions of the Daughters of Albion  in relation to the writing of Mary Wollstonecraft and the analogies she  draws between slavery and marriage. Although alert to the points of  disagreement between Blake and Wollstonecraft, who occupied quite  distinct positions on the matter of sexual liberation, Stevens provides a  fascinating exploration of Blake’s unorthodox belief that slavery  caused suffering not only to those enslaved but to their masters. Via a  close reading of Blake’s treatment of the body and the language employed  by Wollstonecraft, Stevens constructs a forceful argument for  reevaluating Visions in light of late-eighteenth-century politics, both domestic and international.

The complexity of Blake’s political and cultural  positioning is further drawn out in Saree Makdisi’s fascinating  examination of the concepts of unity and difference and David Fuller’s  essay on the Divine Comedy images, while the intricate webbing  of patronage, heritage, and homage is sensitively examined by Andrew  Loukes in reference to Blake’s portraits of poets. Other authors offer  evidence of Blake’s engagement with cultural trends, in particular Jared  Richman, who considers the wide popularity of Milton’s poetry and  Blake’s peculiarly biographical interest in him. This approach is  developed by Martin Myrone, who skillfully situates Blake’s interest in  the supernatural and the sublime in the context of a contemporary vogue  for the Gothic, while insisting upon the particularity of his practice.  There is also a welcome passage on Blake’s immediate predecessors by  William Pressly, in which the artist is seen as the legatee of a  specifically British tradition.

This theme of national heritage is also treated by Robin Simon in his discussion of Songs of Innocence and of Experience.  Simon interprets Blake’s engagement with familiar symbols of British  identity as a means by which the artist introduced the quotidian or  colloquial into a visionary language, by adopting the informal idiom of  Wordsworth, or through reference to the game of cricket. Although the  implication that a sense of national pride can be found in Blake’s work  is unconvincing, Simon offers an interesting consideration of Blake’s  aesthetic choices and the way in which they embodied a rejection of  Reynolds’s theories of art.

Simon’s close reading of Blake’s pictures,  however, is an exception which points up one of the problems of the  catalogue: the concentration upon Blake’s writing. While Simon and some  others tackle Blake’s symbolic visual imagery, a large number of the  essays, among them some of the most engaging, are entirely dedicated to  the poems, or gesture towards the images only as illustrations.  Naturally, a great deal of explanation and interpretation is needed in  introducing a non-English-speaking audience to Blake as an author. While  it may be of great interest to consider the effect of translating  Blake’s work into French, or the prophetic nature (or otherwise) of Europe and America,  it is arguable, however, whether this is the place to do so. This is  not to demand a strict separation of text from image, which would be  contrary to the nature of the works themselves; when faced with so vast a  subject it may perhaps have been more helpful to have limited  discussion to the objects on display, of which there were more than  enough to furnish a rich investigation of Blake’s career.
                     
 
       
10
       
This in turn flags another, and perhaps more  serious, flaw: the inadequate and incoherent use of illustrations.  Images are referred to throughout by catalogue number, which (as not all  objects in the show are reproduced) leaves the reader searching through  pictures that are not in numerical order, and are rarely positioned in  clear relation to the text. This is compounded by inconsistency, when  Martin Butlin (uniquely) decides to employ the numbering system from his  catalogue The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake in order  to direct readers to relevant (but unexhibited) works. With so varied a  selection of themes, and very little clear structure to their  arrangement, this added confusion is particularly keenly felt.
                     
 
       
11
       
Furthermore, the texts are too short to deal with  their subjects adequately, and too often the writers seem to have been  trapped into oversimplification, as in the case of David Alexander, who  discusses Blake’s relationships with his patrons with no critical look  at the artist’s investment in establishing a reputation as romantic  outsider, or Elizabeth C. Denlinger, whose study of Catherine Blake  reads as an unsatisfactorily token gesture towards a forgotten partner.  In essence, while the questions raised by the catalogue are apposite,  and many essays introduce themes that have not been dealt with in the  French literature on Blake, it might have been more productive to have  limited the overall length of the text and included a fuller  bibliography for those who wanted to explore further. This would then  have provided the space for what would really have stimulated an  enthusiasm for Blake’s pictures: high-quality reproductions of the works  themselves, clearly arranged to allow for comparison and  cross-referencing. Without these, the catalogue can only help to  reinforce the notion that Blake’s true achievement was literary, and his  images merely illustrative or incidental.

Attribution and Reproduction: Death Pursuing the Soul through the Avenues of Life
         
By Robert N. Essick
         
Robert N. Essick has been collecting and writing about Blake for over forty years.

                 
1
       
A splendid publication by the William Blake Trust  features reproductions of Blake’s nineteen watercolors illustrating  Robert Blair’s The Grave, rediscovered in 2001, and texts by Martin Butlin and Morton D. Paley. [1] These drawings, plus Prone on the Lonely Grave—She Drops,  which was once part of the group, were executed by Blake in the fall of  1805 on commission from Robert Hartley Cromek, whose edition of the  poem with Blake’s illustrations, engraved by Louis Schiavonetti,  appeared in 1808. Butlin’s contributions to the volume extend to a  consideration of related drawings, including Death Pursuing the Soul through the Avenues of Life (illus. 1).  He states that this work “stands out from the finished watercolours in  that it is a monochrome drawing, finished in sepia washes over pencil on  card in a rather heavy manner uncharacteristic of Blake’s own hand;  although the invention seems to be by the artist [Blake], the work is  perhaps a pencil drawing gone over by someone else to make it more  saleable in the later 19th century.” A long footnote includes the  following comments: 
When this drawing was first brought to my attention in 1965 I  accepted it on the basis of a reproduction but suggested, in a letter  to Sir Geoffrey Keynes of 13 December 1965, that it had perhaps been  gone over in parts by someone else. By the time it was acquired by  Essick in 1971 I had been able to see it and was satisfied that it was a  perfectly good work by Blake and it was included without qualification  in my catalogue in 1981. However, constant brooding over reproductions  of this work has led me to my present doubts.
 Not surprisingly, these statements immediately caught my attention. In 1965 Butlin apparently believed that Death Pursuing  had been “gone over” only “in parts by someone else,” but his statement  in 2009 that it is “a pencil drawing” from Blake’s hand suggests that  he now believes that all the washes were added by “someone else.” While I  am tempted to do some teary-eyed “brooding” myself over Butlin’s  partial deattribution of what I had long considered one of the more  delicious examples of neo-gothic horror in my collection, his comments  raise more general issues about how drawings are attributed, how the  scholar/connoisseur converts subjective responses into convincing  propositions, and how reproductions can play a role in those endeavors.

The basis for Butlin’s change of mind would have  confounded an earlier generation of art historians. For purposes of  attribution, confrontation with the original work of art was not only  essential but definitive. The use of reproductions of any sort was  eschewed; as late as the 1960s, many art historians still refused to use  color reproductions because they were thought inevitably to be  misleading. Such attitudes require revision in light of recent  developments in high-resolution digital imaging. I believe that digital  reproductions of sufficient quality can indeed be the basis for the  attribution (or deattribution) of two-dimensional works of art, even  after studying the original, in just the manner that Butlin describes.  But what sorts of “reproductions” was he brooding over?

I first saw Death Pursuing at Charles  Sessler, Inc., a famous bookshop in Philadelphia, in the summer of 1971.  Mabel Zahn, Sessler’s employee of many years who oversaw prints and  drawings, told me that she had been corresponding with Ruthven Todd  about the work, and that Todd had in turn told Butlin about it. In a  letter to me of 19 August 1971, Zahn stated that she had sent Todd a  “photostatic copy” of Death Pursuing. This was apparently in  the previous year, for in a letter of 1 December 1970 from Todd to Zahn,  he indicates that he had seen some sort of reproduction but also  remarks “if you have the drawing photographed, I’d really appreciate a  copy.” Todd’s letter begins with the forceful statement that “I find  that Martin Butlin agrees with me that Mrs. Holmes’s Blake [Death Pursuing was then in her collection] is indeed a genuine, if perfectly horrible and disgusting, piece of his work.” [2]  Apparently these opinions were based on the “photostatic” copy, a term  that could refer to any number of photographic or electrostatic  reproductions. [3] This apparently was not a conventional photograph, given Todd’s request for one “if you have the drawing photographed.”

The later history of reproductions of Death Pursuing  is equally unprepossessing. I know of only a few prior to the Blake  Trust volume of 2009, all in black and white except for a much reduced  color illustration on page 16 in Sotheby’s New York catalogue of 2 May  2006 offering the nineteen Grave watercolors for sale.  Unfortunately, Sotheby’s illustration shifts the lighter tones toward a  muddy brown. To create a far better reproduction, I asked John Sullivan,  head of imaging services at the Huntington Library, to produce a series  of high-resolution images, including details of selected features. He  used a Phase One P 45+ imaging back mounted on a Hasselblad camera. The  digital file for the complete design is a 72.2 MB TIFF with dimensions  of 6527 x 3853 pixels. At true size (that is, the size of the original)  this yields a 645ppi image. The file of the complete image permits areas  as small as 25 x 16 mm. in the original to be enlarged to a monitor  image of 46.5 x 27.5 cm. without pixelation. Detail shots of the steps,  the winged figure’s torso and face, and the female’s neck and hair allow  for magnification approximately four times greater than enlargements  based on the digital file of the full image. In early 2009, I sent a DVD  of the file of the complete design to John Commander, executive  director of the Blake Trust, for reproduction in the trust’s Grave publication. I believe that this digital image is the basis for the reduced (16.5 x 7.7 cm.) color illustration on page 24.

A few guidelines can now be drawn. Basing  attributions on reproductions is a dicey game. It is always helpful to  know which have been consulted. Among the several reproductions of Death Pursuing,  only the digital images described above are in my view sufficient for  questioning an attribution previously made upon viewing the original  work. I hope that Butlin was shown the digital file I sent to the Blake  Trust and that his opinions are based, at least in part, upon it rather  than the inferior reproductions available between 1970 and 2008.

Although the online reproductions accompanying  this essay do not have the resolution of the TIFFs, they should be  capable of confirming (or questioning) the observations about many of  the details in Death Pursuing presented here. The 300ppi enlargements of the twenty Grave watercolors available in the William Blake Archive http://www.blakearchive.org permit close study of those related works.

The high-resolution TIFFs greatly assist investigation of Death Pursuing.  In several respects, they are superior to using a magnifying glass to  look at the original. The field of vision is much larger, particularly  compared to lens magnifications above the power of five. Zooming in and  out and panning across the entire work are smoother and easier. Although  I have been looking at the original drawing on and off for forty years,  I did not notice several salient features until I studied the TIFFs  side by side with the original. [4] What I found leads me to some perceptions that differ from Butlin’s.

In the Blake Trust volume, Butlin calls Death Pursuing  a “monochrome drawing” in “sepia” washes “on card”; these are among the  reasons that it “stands out from the finished watercolours.” Sepia  means a brown tone, although I find that art historians sometimes use it  in reference to the sort of gray and black washes that dominate Death Pursuing.  There are, however, at least two other colors in the drawing. The most  easily perceived is a patch of blue on the right lower chest of the  winged figure (Death), just above and to the right of his right lower  thigh (illus. 3).  Other, thinner blue washes also highlight his right knee, his right  upper arm, his beard and hair (note particularly the area just right of  his mouth, illus. 4), a triangular section of the wing just above his left shoulder (illus. 3), wing segments right of his left arm (illus. 2), two small ovoid patches above and to the right of the flames (presumably of a torch) covering Death’s left hand (illus. 2), two dark areas below his lower left leg that lie between the shafts of light emanating from the flames (illus. 2), and (very thinly applied) the three step risers (illus. 2)  below Death and the step left of and below the right foot of the female  figure (the Soul). Some of these blue areas have a slightly greenish  appearance and may be either a diluted version of the blue on Death’s  chest or a different color. The two brown spots on Death’s face (illus. 4),  one on his beard below his mouth and one above his right eye, are  stains unrelated to the purposeful coloring. The most interesting color  touches are the (six?) fine red lines, each only about 1 mm. long, on  the back of the Soul’s neck (illus. 5).  These suggest that Death had grasped his victim around her neck,  leaving bloody marks behind, and has just thrown her into the abyss with  his extended right hand. Both the blue and red hues have probably faded  over the years.

Death Pursuing was not executed directly  on a card but on paper, 0.2 mm. thick, mounted on a dark ivory,  pebble-grain paper 0.23 mm. thick. [5]  The two layers, neither with any visible watermark, are slightly  separated along their lower left edges. The back of the mount shows that  it was at one time glued to yet a third backing; removal skinned the  mount and exposed the back of the leaf on which the drawing was  executed. Although the positioning of the twenty Grave watercolors on their mounts does not permit easy measurement, the 0.2 mm. paper of Death Pursuing, when placed upside down next to two of the twenty, appears to be of about the same thickness. [6]  The 0.23 mm. backing paper does not match the mounts of the twenty  watercolors, although one cannot completely rule out the possibility  that this watercolor was once attached to the same type of mount.

Butlin states that the washes in Death Pursuing  are “over pencil.” This seems likely, although there are very few lines  I have been able to identify as pencil. One such line curves slightly  above the arched upper reaches of the portal above Death (illus. 1).  The colorist changed the position of the arch, particularly on the  left, and thus the pencil line was covered by only a light gray wash  rather than the dark wash within the arch. Another line possibly in  pencil wraps around the wing strut just above the torch (illus. 2).  The colorist did not follow the line below the strut. There may of  course be a good many other pencil lines, now covered by the  watercolors.

The attribution of a work of art cannot be made  in complete isolation from the possible contexts of its production. In  this instance, we have two contexts to consider: Blake’s execution of  the illustrations in 1805, and the coloring of Death Pursuing “in the later 19th century” proposed by Butlin. Both need careful consideration.

No one has questioned the belief (I am tempted to call it a fact) that Blake designed Death Pursuing in response to Cromek’s commission to illustrate The Grave. [7] R. H. Cromek’s son, Thomas Hartley Cromek, wrote the following on the back of the mount (illus. 6): 
Illustration to “Urizen” – a poem by William Blake – who also made this  drawing–  It belonged to my father.                         Thomas _ H. Cromek
 The error in associating the design with Blake’s Book of Urizen  may have been based on similarities between Death and some of the more  horrific figures in that illuminated book. Allan Cunningham, in his 1830  biography of Blake, describes several designs in Urizen and  claims that one of the “exploits” of an “evil spirit” pictured in them  is “to chase a female soul through a narrow gate and hurl her headlong  down into a darksome pit.” [8] Cunningham, who lived with the Cromek family from April to the fall of 1810, [9] was very probably describing Death Pursuing. The drawing may have become dissociated from other Grave designs and identified with Urizen as early as 1810, and almost certainly by 1830. Death Pursuing  probably remained in T. H. Cromek’s possession until at least 1863, for  he appears to be referring to it when he notes in his journal that the  copy of Urizen in the British Museum “does not contain the  subject which I have by him and which I was told by Mr. Frost A.R.A.  formed one of the illustrations.” [10]
                 
 
       
13
       
As Butlin notes, Death Pursuing the Soul through the Avenues of Life  is listed under that title as number “11” of fifteen designs in  Cromek’s first prospectus, dated “Nov. 1805,” for his edition of The Grave. [11]  This, I believe, is a key document for considering the issue of  attribution. All the other fourteen designs listed, with the possible  exception of an untraced drawing for “A characteristic Frontispiece,”  are known as colored drawings, or at the very least as a monochrome wash  drawing. [12] If Death Pursuing  came into Cromek’s hands as nothing more than a pencil drawing, it  would have been the only design selected on the basis of a work in that  medium alone. In spite of the outré (and for some tastes even  “disgusting”) features of the image, Cromek may have chosen the design  for inclusion in his first prospectus because it might appeal to the  public taste for the gothic, but for him to have done so on the basis of  a pencil drawing alone is surprising. It would also have been a little  odd for Cunningham so readily to describe Death Pursuing as part of (rather than a preliminary for) The Book of Urizen if the drawing had existed only as a pencil sketch rather than a more finished design, like those in all copies of Urizen.

As I mentioned earlier, it is difficult to see much pencil drawing underlying the washes in Death Pursuing. Fortunately, Blake’s preliminary sketches for his Grave  designs, and the under-drawing in pencil noted (but not described in  any detail) by Butlin for seventeen of the twenty watercolors, offer  some clues about Death Pursuing when it existed only as a  pencil drawing. The visible under-drawing in the seventeen watercolors  is not extensive, although here again we can assume that some lines are  covered with watercolors or pen-and-ink work. [13] As in Death Pursuing,  pencil work is most visible where the overlying pen-and-ink lines or  washes stray from the under-drawing. The sides of the background doorway  in Christ Descending into the Grave and a few lines of  radiance above Christ’s head seem to be in pencil. Two of the latter  were ignored by Blake when he drew over most of these lines in pen and  ink. Some lines defining the ruffled hem of Christ’s garment, also not  followed by the pen, are pencil. One or two pencil strokes right of the  man’s waist and left hip in Prone on the Lonely Grave—She Drops  show that Blake moved these motifs slightly to the left when he drew  them in pen and ink. There are a few sketchy pencil lines defining cloud  outlines, and some odd pencil strokes on the man’s upper left chest, in  Whilst Surfeited upon Thy Damask Cheek. Other designs in the  group of seventeen show similar odd bits of pencil work, including the  bottom edge of the cloth covering the bed in The Soul Hovering over the Body Reluctantly Parting with Life, cloud outlines and the decorations at the top of the columns in Heaven’s Portals Wide Expand to Let Him In, and lines of radiance and shading on the base of the doorway and its posts and lintel in Death’s Door. All in all, the under-drawing that can be seen in these watercolors is sparse and sketchy.
                 
 
       
15
       
Most of the extant preliminary pencil drawings for the Grave watercolors are little more than quick sketches, first thoughts on paper. [14] Significantly, none of these sketches, unlike Death Pursuing,  has a provenance leading back to either R. H. or T. H. Cromek. Many are  traceable to Frederick Tatham, who very probably acquired them from  Catherine Blake, who inherited them from her husband. Apparently Blake  supplied the elder Cromek only with the washed or colored drawings and  retained the preliminaries; this would have been standard procedure for  commissioned work. Only the sketch for The Soul Hovering over the Body Reluctantly Parting with Life  includes indications of the figures’ facial features, but varies in  several major respects (e.g., the position, configuration, and costuming  of the man’s body) from the watercolor. Even if the pencil drawing  lying beneath the washes of Death Pursuing had been developed as fully as the sketch for The Soul Hovering,  the colorist (whether Blake or someone else) created most of what we  now see. Death’s face is carefully detailed with very small brushstrokes  (illus. 4);  it is highly unlikely that the colorist was merely following pencil  lines. The freely drawn lines defining the Soul’s dangling hair (illus. 5) and flames covering Death’s left hand (illus. 2) appear to have been executed with pen and ink alone. The act of coloring was also an act of composition.
                 
 
       
16
       
Apparently another reason for Butlin’s sense that Death Pursuing “stands out” from the Grave  watercolors is the “rather heavy manner” of the “washes,” a manner  “uncharacteristic of Blake’s own hand.” I suspect that any such labored  handling is most apparent in Death’s face and body (illus. 3, 4); the rest of the composition, including the personified Soul, does not seem at all heavy to me. The Grave  watercolors, all referred to as “finished” by Butlin, exhibit a wide  range of styles, techniques, and levels of finish. Indeed, one could  claim that several of the watercolors stand out from their companions on  stylistic or technical grounds. Death of the Strong Wicked Man and The Grave Personified  are quite richly colored with considerable attention to flesh tones  created through the application of very small brushstrokes in blue,  brown, and rose. In contrast, parts of Prone on the Lonely Grave—She Drops are left uncolored or shaded only with broad washes. The Day of Judgment  exhibits a wide range of coloring techniques. An area of dark sky above  the dome in the lower right quadrant, probably applied with a  relatively dry brush, shows the sort of fine reticulations we can also  see on Death’s face, right arm, right thigh, and torso in Death Pursuing (illus. 3, 4)—and in the same or a very similar color. The detailed brushwork in Death Pursuing also recalls Blake’s work as a portrait miniaturist begun in 1801 under William Hayley’s tutelage. [15] Butlin has interestingly associated A Destroying Deity, a drawing in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, with the Grave  designs and has even identified a passage in the poem it may illustrate  (Blake Trust publication, p. 54). This deity’s bat-like wings are  strikingly similar to Death’s and, to my eye, executed in a similar  manner with washes and pen-and-ink outlining.

Butlin’s proposal that someone had “gone over” Death Pursuing  “to make it more saleable in the later 19th century” prompts several  questions. The history of the drawing after T. H. Cromek, who died in  1873, is somewhat speculative until it entered the collection of Mrs.  Artemas Holmes, Philadelphia, no earlier than the 1930s. It may have  been the drawing sold at Christie’s in 1880 for £1.15s. [16]  Thus, the work had very little market value in the second half of the  nineteenth century. The tinting of Death’s face and parts of his body is  minutely articulated with small brushstrokes; the blue and red touches  are hardly visible to the naked eye. Why would anyone go to all the  trouble to execute such detailed work, principally in monochrome washes,  when a few splashes of rich color (perhaps yellows and fiery reds, pink  flesh for the Soul, prominent blood on her neck) would have added much  more to the drawing’s saleability? It is possible that a colorist may  have believed that the labor required for detailed development of the  drawing would be adequately compensated in the marketplace, but if  prompted by a profit motive such a colorist must have been badly  informed about the commercial value of Blake’s art and sorely  disappointed.

No amount of argument or theorizing can overcome  the primacy of the vision and intuitions of the connoisseur’s eye. I  have no vain hope of changing anyone’s opinion of Death Pursuing,  least of all Butlin’s. Rather, my purpose has been to exemplify some  ways of using reproductions and historical contexts in cases of  attribution, particularly when a leading expert has vacillated between  attribution and deattribution. Although I believe that Death Pursuing  is entirely Blake’s work, I must confess to some slight misgivings. If  someone else fiddled with the drawing, I suspect that it was fairly  early in its history and confined to Death’s face. [17]  The most likely candidate for any such intervention is T. H. Cromek, a  skilled watercolorist, although I find little similarity between the  techniques used in Death Pursuing and Cromek’s renderings of  landscapes and buildings. Whatever the truth, however, Cromek, Butlin,  and I would appear to share a common fate, spending part of our lives  brooding over Death Pursuing.

It is in fact a trade name, and a ‘Photostat’ copy of a  document is one produced by the ‘Photostat’ apparatus.” The term has  also been used to refer to electrostatic reproductions, such as a copy  by Xerox technology.

10. Quoted from the partial  transcription of the manuscript journal by the book dealers John Hart  and Chris Johnson in a typescript titled “Robert Hartley Cromek and  Thomas Hartley Cromek with Records of Blake and Turner and Other  Contemporary Artists” (2008) [43-44]. The Cromek papers are now in  Princeton University Library. It is unlikely that Frost, born in 1810,  was the origin of the erroneous association with The Book of Urizen. As Bentley (638fn) points out, “it is difficult to determine whether the mistaken association with Urizen  originated with Cunningham or with T. H. Cromek.” In his catalogue of  Blake’s drawings and paintings, William Michael Rossetti places a work  probably identifiable as Death Pursuing in the possession of the London dealer Francis Harvey by 1863; see Alexander Gilchrist, Life of William Blake, “Pictor Ignotus”  (London: Macmillan, 1863) 2: 241, no. 15. Perhaps Cromek lent the  drawing to Harvey, or placed it on consignment with him, in the same  year in which he described it as a “subject which I have.”
 
11. The complete prospectus is reproduced in Bentley 210-12. Death Pursuing was excluded when Cromek reduced the number of illustrations to the twelve published in his 1808 edition.
 
12. I can find only monochrome washes in The Counseller, King, Warrior, Mother and Child in the Tomb,  described by Butlin as “pen, ink and watercolour over pencil” (no. 4 in  the Blake Trust volume). It is quite possible that the “characteristic  Frontispiece” is the design used on the title page of Cromek’s edition  (Butlin’s no. 1) or, less probably, The Grave Personified (no. 13) or Our Time Is Fix’d and All Our Days Are Number’d! (no. 18). These three are among the nineteen Grave watercolors discovered in 2001; none is listed in the first prospectus.
 
13. My comments on pencil lines are based principally on the enlargements in the William Blake Archive.
 
14. These are nos. 614, 615, 619, 621, 623, 624 recto and verso, 625, 629, 632, 634, and 636 in Martin Butlin, The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake,  2 vols. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1981), pls. 851, 852, 854,  856, 857, 859-65. Some of these preliminary sketches are not known to  have been developed further. Eight of the preliminary drawings for the  watercolors are reproduced in the Blake Trust publication.
 
15. See the miniatures of  John Johnson, William Cowper, Thomas Butts, Mrs. Butts, and Thomas  Butts, Jr., nos. 347, 353, 354, 376-78 and pls. 455, 459, 460, 476-78 in  Butlin, The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake. For a  discussion of this technique in the context of another attribution  problem, see Essick, “A (Self?) Portrait of William Blake,” Blake 39.3 (winter 2005-06): 126-39.
 
16. For this part of the provenance record, see Butlin, The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake, no. 635. At the time he wrote his catalogue, Butlin did not know that Death Pursuing probably remained in T. H. Cromek’s possession until at least 1863.
 
17. David Bindman has expressed doubts similar to mine in conversation in Apr. 2009.

Hazard Adams modestly introduces Blake’s Margins  by describing it as “less for scholars … than for people who want to  know more about Blake’s thought … and for students in the early stages  of study of his work” (3). Beginners will find most of this eminently  sensible and learned book edifying, but in fact there are very few Blake  scholars anywhere who would not benefit from reading it straight  through. In some ways, Blake’s annotations are among the least ironic of  his writings, but every Blakean marginalium is a tail that wags a very  substantial dog: we can’t really understand a given one without  attending to the interplay with the full annotated text and with the  broader contexts that contributed to Blake’s response. Since even the  best Blake editions inevitably misrepresent the marginalia by  supplementing them with (at most) snippets of the annotated texts, many  of which are unfamiliar and/or out of print, it would be a good thing if  Blakists were in the habit of reviewing the relevant chapter in Adams  before quoting anything written in a margin. Of course it would be even  better if we all reread, say, the last third of Berkeley’s Siris with  care before repeating “God is not a Mathematical Diagram,” but if that  is not to happen, Adams’s judicious summaries will help us much more  with the nuances of that declaration than, for instance, the two barely  relevant sentences from Berkeley quoted by David Erdman in his edition  (E 664).

And of course it’s even more complicated than that: as Adams shows, the relevant context of Blake’s annotations to Siris includes not only Berkeley’s Principles of Human Knowledge,  but beyond Berkeley, John Locke, with whom Blake had his own extensive  dialogue. Sometimes the wagged dog is a whole pack: for the two  (somewhat conjectural) annotations to Spurzheim’s Observations on the Deranged Manifestations of the Mind, or Insanity,  Adams adduces the relevance of “Spurzheim’s career, that of his mentor  Franz Joseph Gall, phrenology as practiced by them, and the contents of  Spurzheim’s book,” as well as the various physiognomical texts derived  from the work of Johann Caspar Lavater (139-40).

Covering thirteen surviving or recorded instances of annotation, [1]  Adams proceeds author by author in the approximate order in which Blake  wrote his remarks. He introduces each annotatee briefly, locates the  annotated work in the annotatee’s career, discusses the general  reception of the work, and then moves through it, remarking upon Blake’s  most notable responses. Adams is alert to both variations in Blake’s  mode of reading and modulations in his rhetorical stance: at times Blake  seems to be an earnest student taking notes, or a helpful editor,  sometimes a cheerleader or contentious crank, more often an acidic  antagonist. In many cases, the stance changes as Blake reads the book,  and at other times he seems to have read the text through at least once,  then returned, loaded for bear. Although Adams often comments about how  a given remark fits into Blake’s thought as expressed elsewhere, he is  careful not to squeeze all expressions into a universal Blakean  ideology, and regularly reminds us when the critical vocabulary of the  annotations is the annotatee’s, not Blake’s.

The most successful chapters are those in which  Adams can bring to bear his wide learning in literature and philosophy  at large, as in the chapters on Bacon, Watson’s Apology for the Bible, or Wordsworth’s Poems.  He also seems more confident when the cultural contexts are primarily  verbal—he knows Blake’s visual art well but rarely discusses pictures by  others, even when Blake appears to be responding to visual art and  artistic practices.

The substantial chapter on Blake’s mostly vitriolic responses to Malone’s edition of Reynolds’s Discourses covers  the territory that is most familiar to Blakeans, and is probably the  subject most thoroughly considered by Adams himself, but for me this  chapter was less efficiently helpful than, say, that on Swedenborg,  which is roughly as long. Adams, whose procedure throughout is eminently  reasonable, strives mightily to establish terms in which bitterly  unreasonable Blake and smooth, slippery Reynolds might have been able to  discuss important questions about art, but for Blake at least, the  encounter with Reynolds is a battle to the death with Error, and he  seems to have found very little to be reasonable about. Adams’s deft  summaries of the thrust of the annotatee’s arguments are less relevant  here than elsewhere in the book: when responding to Reynolds, Blake  isn’t much interested in the ostensible arguments, which seem to him a  mere cloak for wicked intentions. Even when Blake agrees with something  Reynolds says, it is because the Sheep’s clothing necessarily has  something to do with the Lamb, not because Blake is any friendlier to  the Wolf.

A brief addendum on Blake’s reading summarizes  discursively the information assembled about Blake’s library by Keynes,  Bentley, and others. This could have been an entire book on its own—and  if Adams were to write such a book it would be a wonderful thing—but  even at this length it is a helpful list. And yet “books read” is a much  more complicated category—and subject of study—than “books annotated,”  because one has no way to tell which of Blake’s diverse modes of reading  he applied to a given book that he demonstrably read. Further, the  criteria used to decide whether to report that Blake read a book or an  author are not discussed, so dozens of complicated questions are  skirted. One can’t tell whether Marshall’s The Life of George Washington,  which Blake told Hayley he had but hadn’t read “yet” (E 749), is  omitted because we can assume he never read it or simply because it was  overlooked; similarly, Potter’s (not “Palmer’s”) translation of  Aeschylus is listed as read (196) even though the book in question is  unmarked beyond Blake’s signature, and as far as I know unmentioned by  Blake, though it is reasonable to suppose that he would have been  interested in it. Further, we know that Blake owned and read a copy of  Bysshe’s Art of Poetry, with its extensive collection of  snippets of verse, so one can’t be sure he actually read all the poets  whom he quotes if the quoted texts are included in Bysshe. Another  problem is that we can’t tell from the fact that he engraved plates for a  book whether he ever saw, much less read, the actual text of it.

Blake’s Margins is hardly the last word  that will be written about the marginalia. It is sturdily unpretentious  in method as well as modest in its claims, and its virtues are more  likely to prove durable than those of, say, Jason Snart’s much more  ostentatious study, The Torn Book: UnReading William Blake’s Marginalia (Selinsgrove:  Susquehanna University Press, 2006), which Adams praises faintly as  “interesting” (6). But it will probably be some time before there is  much need for another comprehensive treatment of the marginalia as a  whole. Adams has found a level of discussion that suits the annotated  volumes in all their variety, and the most fruitful of the next round of  studies will probably focus on Blake’s responses to individual authors.
               
 
     

     
   Note   1. To which should probably be added now the Cardinales’ recent discovery of Blake’s annotations to Thomas Taylor’s Mystical Initiations (see Blake 44.3 [winter 2010-11]: 84-102).

Eternity in the Moment: William Blake and Mary Oliver
         
By Jennifer Davis Michael
         
Jennifer Davis Michael (jmichael@sewanee.edu) is professor of English at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, and author of Blake and the City (Bucknell University Press, 2006). 

                 
 
       
       
Seven white butterflies delicate in a hurry look how they bang the pages        of their wings as they fly  to the fields of mustard yellow and orange and plain gold all eternity        is in the moment this is what  Blake said Whitman said such wisdom in the agitated motions of the mind …. [1]

Of all the modern and contemporary poets who have  been influenced by Blake, Mary Oliver might seem an unlikely heir. We  think automatically of the visionary system of Yeats, the pugnacious  lyricism of Roethke, the prophetic excess of Ginsberg, or the erudite  obscurity of Geoffrey Hill. We certainly don’t expect to find Blake’s  challenging and transcendent poetics echoed in simple verses that  celebrate the “god of dirt,” [2]  the messy world of vultures, skunks, and pond scum. On the other hand,  Oliver’s deliberate invocations of Blake prod us to look again at his  attitude toward nature and the physical body. Even her most  “naturalistic” poems, like the one above, are steeped in the language of  art: the butterflies’ wings are “pages” like those of Blake’s  illuminated books, their energy the “agitated / motions of the mind.”  For both poets, the human mind marks the border between the material and  spiritual worlds, and the poet’s task is to awaken the reader’s  imagination toward some purpose. That purpose generally is not made  explicit but rather grows organically out of the visionary experience:  an experience in which “ordinary” perception is suspended.

Unlike the notoriously difficult Blake, Oliver’s  poetry seems accessible to the point of simplicity. Winner of both a  Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award, she consistently ranks among  America’s best-selling poets. [3]  Not all critics share this popular enthusiasm: one has accused her of  “a peculiar lack of genuine engagement with the natural world,” [4] and others find her poems formulaic and predictable. [5]  Renée Loth cheerfully (if somewhat condescendingly) writes, “Her ‘Wild  Geese’ has become so popular it now graces posters in dorm rooms across  the land. But don’t hold that against her.” [6]  Indeed, the mixed response to Oliver turns upon a crux of romanticism,  which often finds itself divided between the populism of Wordsworth’s  “man speaking to men” and the haughtiness of the misunderstood genius,  which easily shades into contempt for poetry that succeeds in the  marketplace.

Oliver has been characterized as a neo-romantic,  but, her defenders hasten to add, her poetry is “not a flight into the  transcendent.” [7] This  defensive notion of transcendence as flight indicates how far we have  come in our material pragmatism, but it also reveals some confusion as  to the meaning of the word. In theological terms, transcendence  (existing apart from the world) is often contrasted with immanence  (inhering and abiding in it). The word “transcend,” however, literally  means “to climb over or beyond,” and we may ask what one is to climb  upon in order to reach those supernatural heights. It is one thing to  argue that God exists beyond the created universe, but if poetry is to  transcend the earth, it must take off from solid ground. Blake  represents the heavenly city, Jerusalem, as a city built “In Englands  green and pleasant Land”: [8] this material earth is where the prophet must start, no matter how lofty the goal.

Just as Blake warns against “Single vision and  Newtons sleep” (E 722), Oliver presents a world that is more than  matter. In “What Is It?” a white flower becomes a snowy egret, as the  poet asks, “how could anyone believe / that anything in this world / is  only what it appears to be[?]” [9]  Oliver shares with Blake a commitment to seeing beyond the opaque  surfaces of things to find “the white fire of a great mystery” (HL  59) even in a grain of sand, and eternity not in an hour (as in Blake’s  “Auguries of Innocence”) but, more intensely, “in the moment.” Through  such Blakean images as sunflowers, moths, snakes, and roses, Oliver’s  adaptation and reinterpretation of Blake help us to reevaluate both his  “mysticism” and his view of nature, two crucial subjects that are often  misunderstood. By communing with nature in a way that neither idealizes  it nor accepts its absolute otherness, Oliver joins Blake in challenging  and dismantling many of the binaries that have come to define  romanticism: mind and nature, self and other, soul and body. [10]

Allusions and Appropriations       
Before exploring Oliver’s explicit allusions to Blake, it is  worth noting that many more of her poems show a general affinity with  him, especially the Blake of Visions of the Daughters of Albion and The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,  for whom “every thing that lives is holy.” Her “Sand Dabs”—a series of  aphorisms named for “a small, bony, not very significant but  well-put-together fish” [11]—recall  the Proverbs of Hell both in their pithy insight and in their  celebration of nature’s variety and minutiae: “The fur behind the  mouse’s ear stuns the finger with its softness” (LL 85). “If you think daylight is just daylight / then it is just daylight” (WW 24). [12]  Another warns the aspiring poet, “Don’t close the poem as you opened  it, unless your name is Blake and you have written a poem about a  Tyger.” [13]

While Oliver’s recent poems, such as those in Thirst  (2006), invoke a more explicitly Christian idiom, she joins Blake in  rejecting a repressive moralism. One of her best-known poems, “Wild  Geese,” begins:       
You do not have to be good. You do not have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting. You only have to let the soft animal of your body     love what it loves. [14]
 Blake repeatedly divorces the Gospel from morality, stating, for  instance, “The Gospel is Forgiveness of Sins and has No Moral  Precepts” (E 619). On the other hand, Oliver’s celebration of the “soft  animal of your body” might seem, at least to the later Blake, to be a  denial of the spirit: a suggestion that we are only mammals. As  her poem continues, however, it affirms a larger, more expansive  incorporation: “the world offers itself to your imagination, / … / …  announcing your place / in the family of things.” It is through the body  (as Blake would agree) that paradise is regained: “This will come to  pass by an improvement of sensual enjoyment” (E 39). Through the free  play of energy, “the only life … from the Body” (E 34), both Blake and  Oliver conceive the reintegration of the universe, a “family of things”  that is simultaneously material and spiritual. [15]
                 
7
       
Even the presentation of Oliver’s books suggests Blake’s tutelary spirit. An early chapbook, The Night Traveler, features one of Blake’s woodcut illustrations to Virgil’s Pastorals on its cover, suggesting a complicated relationship both to nature and to literary history. [16]  Nature is first mediated through Virgil, then through Blake, and  finally through Oliver, who calls attention to the bookish ways we  apprehend the “book” of nature. In “Farm Country,” she challenges the  reader who may have derived sentimental notions of rural life from  literature: “Maybe you think life is chicken soup, served / In blue  willow-pattern bowls.” [17]  The rest of the poem describes the speaker sharpening knives, putting  on apron and boots, and entering the henhouse. Other poems in this  chapbook include “The Lamb,” a first-person tale of lost innocence in a  dangerous natural world, and “Winter in the Country,” an Experienced  account of “prey and hawk together, / Still flying, both exhausted, / In  the blue sack of weather” (NT n. pag.). Her sympathy for the  predator, both here and in subsequent work, recalls Blake’s celebration  of the lion and the tiger.

So far, Oliver would seem to be in tune with  Blake’s nuanced approach to the natural world, and even to echo his  understanding of the human role in constructing nature. Other  references, however, suggest a more limited and even sentimental  impression of Blake. The poem entitled “‘Just a minute,’ Said a Voice  …” [18] alludes to Blake’s tale of witnessing a fairy’s funeral, reported in Allan Cunningham’s early biography. [19] In another poem, “The Swan,” Mrs. Blake misses her husband’s company: “he is so often / in paradise” (HL 16-17). West Wind, the volume whose title alludes so strongly to Shelley, [20]  nonetheless begins with an epigraph from Alexander Gilchrist’s  biography in which Blake claims to have touched the sky with his  stick. [21] Each of these  anecdotes seems to emphasize a Blake quite different from Oliver: a  visionary (or simply airy) eccentric far more attuned to worlds beyond  the world of dirt, blood, and bones that fills Oliver’s poetry. The  apparent incongruity demands closer scrutiny.

Several decades ago, Northrop Frye cautioned  against referring to Blake as a “mystic,” reserving the term “mysticism”  for “a form of spiritual communion with God which is by its nature  incommunicable to anyone else.” For the artist this experience could  only be “a means to another end,” i.e., the poem. Frye suggests  replacing “mystic” with “visionary”: “A visionary creates, or dwells in,  a higher spiritual world in which the objects of perception in this one  have become transfigured and charged with a new intensity of  symbolism.” [22] Where I  quarrel with Frye is in his characterization of the visionary’s world as  “higher” and “spiritual.” Surely what Blake and Oliver create is our  own world, only transformed. The objects of perception have not  disappeared, but rather have become translucent media for divine light.
                 
10
       
Oliver’s adoption of Blake as mentor suggests a  desire to look through, not merely at, the things of this world. Looking  through, however, comes only after looking at them with reverence, and  resisting what Douglas Burton-Christie calls “the impulse to  domesticate.” [23] In “The Swan,” the allusion to Mrs. Blake leads directly to the speaker’s epiphany that “paradise” is not a distant place: 
              Of course! the path to heaven  doesn’t lie down in flat miles.      It’s in the imagination           with which you perceive                this world,  and the gestures      with which you honor it.           Oh, what will I do, what will I say, when those                            white wings                   touch the shore? (HL 17)
 Imagination, then, is not a means of transport to another world, but  rather a way of opening the “doors” (as Blake would say) of the senses  with which we perceive this world: “How do you know but ev’ry Bird that  cuts the airy way, / Is an immense world of delight, clos’d by your  senses five?” (E 35). Eternity moves toward the speaker in the shape of a  swan, and she has only to stand still to receive it. One has only to  recall the myth of Leda to understand her panic at this approach and her  urge to turn away from the divine.
                 
11
       
“This Morning Again It Was in the Dusty Pines” (NS  23-24) describes another encounter with a bird, in the tradition of  Keats’s “Nightingale,” Hopkins’s “Windhover,” and even Plath’s “Black  Rook.” Unlike her predecessors, however, Oliver has no conversation with  the owl and receives no epiphany from it. Instead, she emphasizes the  impossibility of communication, her own “stony silence” and the owl’s  turning away. Like “god’s bark-colored thumb” (NS 24) or  Blake’s eagle, the owl is “a portion of Genius” (E 37) at once revealed  and elusive. For all her effusions over flowers, hummingbirds, dogs, and  cats, Oliver spends at least equal time on the wild, the ugly, the  dangerous: bears, skunks, alligators. These, too, manifest aspects of  the divine.

“Spring Azures” is, at least on the surface,  Oliver’s most problematic appropriation of Blake, as it seems to  reinforce a false split between spirit and matter to produce an  airy-fairy Blake. First, the poem describes the butterflies “bow[ing]  down / … / to drink the black rain water” before rising to “float away  into the fields.” The speaker then expresses weariness with the “great  bones” of life and wishes for wings to “rise / from the black rain  water.” “And then,” she says,       
           I think of Blake, in the dirt and sweat of London—a boy staring through the window, when God came fluttering up.  Of course, he screamed, seeing the bobbin of God’s blue body leaning on the sill, and the thousand-faceted eyes.  Well, who knows. Who knows what hung, fluttering, at the window between him and the darkness.  Anyway, Blake the hosier’s son stood up and turned away from the sooty sill and the dark city— turned away forever from the factories, the personal strivings,  to a life of the imagination. (NS 8-9)
     
                 
13
       
My first response on reading this poem (like  that, I imagine, of many Blakeans) was to say, “No, he didn’t turn away  from the city ‘to’ imagination. The city is, and is made of, imagination, as we see in Milton and Jerusalem.”  A second reading, however, led me to a much more subtle analogy. “God’s  blue body” is a hybrid of nature and art, the “fluttering” blue azures  and the “bobbin” of the weaver’s craft. God was “leaning on the sill,”  the same “sooty sill” from which Blake turns away. Eternity is manifest  in this dirty world, “in love with the productions of time” (E 36). In  other words, Blake’s imagination is fed by the city even if, and as, he  turns from it. Imagination does not so much rise above the earth but  from it, as the butterflies from the rainwater.
                 
14
       
Oliver’s repetition of the phrase “turned away” also echoes the final stanza of Blake’s “Introduction” to Songs of Experience: 
Turn away no more: Why wilt thou turn away The starry floor The watry shore Is giv’n thee till the break of day. (E 18)
       These lines are addressed to the “lapsed Soul” of Earth, urging her to  remain connected to eternity despite her temporarily bound condition.  There is some irony in Oliver’s application of similar language to the  young Blake, who (she claims) turns away from the earthly city to build  his heavenly one. Perhaps her apparent misreading is deliberate. The  turning away that Oliver describes in Blake mirrors her own struggle in  the poem “Singapore” (HL 8-9), where the speaker experiences “a  darkness … ripped from my eyes” as she watches a woman cleaning  ashtrays in the airport toilet. 
A poem should always have birds in it. Kingfishers, say, with their bold eyes and gaudy wings. Rivers are pleasant, and of course trees. A waterfall, or if that’s not possible, a fountain     rising and falling. A person wants to stand in a happy place, in a poem.
 The poem moves back and forth between the speaker’s current surroundings  (mundane, even disgusting) and her fantasy of the ideal poetic  landscape, which she gently satirizes. The fulcrum on which her  consciousness pivots is the wordless encounter with the cleaning woman,  whose work Oliver compares to “a river,” her dark hair to “the wing of a  bird.” Although she would like to transport the woman magically from  the squalid restroom to the riverbank, she acknowledges that “This  probably won’t happen.” The poem’s resolution resists fantasy even as it  denies the dichotomy of the natural and man-made worlds: 
Neither do I mean anything miraculous, but only the light that can shine out of a life. I mean the way she unfolded and refolded the blue cloth, the way her smile was only for my sake; I mean the way this poem is filled with trees, and birds.
 Like the young Blake whom Oliver imagines at the windowsill, the speaker  feels a visceral “disgust” at the woman’s labor and its environment  (the placeless place of the airport). The apparent non sequitur about  what a poem “should” contain seems intended to mock not only Oliver’s  other poems but also her reader’s post-romantic expectations. Even the  desire to free the woman from her servitude seems, in part,  self-serving: another way to sanitize the poem, in keeping with the  pastoral tradition that conceals human labor. On the other hand, as  David Baker says, “the poet’s own job is similar to the custodian’s, to  serve as caretaker to the human and the natural, to try to make  the world clean again; in essence, for Oliver, not to ignore the world  in the first place, since beauty and grace are characteristics of people  as well as snowy owls.” [24]  More than that, the conclusion of “Singapore” brings nature into the  airport restroom by means of that look that passes between the two  women. The poem is “filled with trees, and birds” because the speaker is  able to see the beauty in the other woman’s work and in her person;  because she resists her own revulsion long enough to see into another’s  life. Similarly, in “Spring Azures,” the “sooty sill” of Blake’s London  is the same window in which God appears to him, and his turning to  imagination is a turning toward the incarnation of that God.

Thel, Oliver, and the Politics of Mother Nature 				
Perhaps Oliver’s most sustained engagement with a Blakean text  appears in “Have You Ever Tried to Enter the Long Black Branches,” which  concludes the volume West Wind. This poem may be read as an answer to Blake’s Book of Thel.  The “you” of the poem is trapped in the solipsistic selfhood that Blake  so often condemns, a Urizenic state that, if it acknowledges the world  outside it at all, sees it as “only an entertainment.” The great failure  for Oliver, as for Blake, is the failure to pay attention: “Never to  enter the sea and notice how the water divides with perfect courtesy, to  let you in! / Never to lie down on the grass, as though you were the  grass! / … // No wonder we hear, in your mournful voice, the complaint  that something is missing from your life!” (WW 61).

                 
16
       
In this “complaint that something is missing” I  hear the voice of Thel, who struggles to find some purpose in the face  of her mortality, complaining “who shall find my place” and “no one  hears my voice” (E 4). Other poems of Oliver’s also suggest conversing  with objects in nature, as Thel does, in order to understand one’s place  in the cosmos: 
Last night the rain spoke to me slowly, saying,   what joy  to come falling out of the brisk cloud …. [25]
 In “Have You Ever Tried …” Oliver speaks not in first but in second  person, shifting at times into a prophetic, questioning mode: 
Who can open the door who does not reach for the latch? …………………………………………………………………………… Who will behold the inner chamber who has not observed        with admiration, even with rapture, the outer stone?  Well, there is time left— fields everywhere invite you into them.  ……………………………………………………………………………  To put one’s foot into the door of the grass, which is        the mystery, which is death as well as life, and        not be afraid!  To set one’s foot in the door of death, and be overcome        with amazement! (WW 61-62)
                 These exhortations seem to evoke and encourage Thel’s sequence of  conversations with the Lilly, the Cloud, and the Clod of Clay, in which  she seeks to learn from them her place in the natural world but shrinks  from identifying with them: “I am not like thee.” Many of Oliver’s  exhortations are phrased as infinitives, “to put, to set,” but then  these “to”s become prepositions, as “god the ten-fingered” (fully  incarnate) nods “to the flowers … to the song … to the tiplets of the  honeysuckle.” In other words, the act of placing oneself in a receptive  position leads to relationships with all these objects.
                 
17
       
Thel, of course, “[sets her] foot in the door of  death,” as her catabasis brings her to “her own grave plot,” which  yields no answers, but only a series of despairing questions about the  horrors of the natural body. Specifically, the questions protest the  vulnerability of the senses: “Why cannot the Ear be closed to its own  destruction? / Or the glistning Eye to the poison of a smile! /… / Why a  Tongue impress’d with honey from every wind?” (E 6). When Oliver’s poem  shifts from second person to first, the speaker sits “among the  thorns,” speaking “to the wild roses: / deny me not, / but suffer my  devotion.” Like Thel, she hears a voice from the plants, though not the  elaborate rhetoric of the Lilly or Cloud. The roses (apparently) speak  to her in italics, countering “those dark shouters, / caution and prudence” [26] with the command “Fall in! Fall in! ” Here, instead of falling into military rank, the implication is to fall into life: precisely the calamity that Thel fears.
                 
18
       
Like Thel, Oliver’s speaker seems to retreat at  the end, with a similar ambiguity: “I climb. I backtrack. / I float. / I  ramble my way home.” Yet she does so without Thel’s shriek, and with a  distinct implication that to be “home” is to be at home in the natural  world. More particularly, as Vicki Graham points out, Oliver uses the  physical senses to imagine herself “into the body of another”: a  blurring of ego boundaries that “many theorists claim put[s] the woman  writer at risk.” [27]  Many critics, of course, have debated the validity of Thel’s “virgin  fears”: Frye, for example, reads her flight as a refusal to be  born. [28] More recently, some have defended her rejection of a patriarchal world that absorbs the woman into the cycle of nature. [29]  Oliver’s poem obliquely takes part in that debate, while her role as  both “woman poet” and “nature poet” has created similar challenges for  her critics.
                 
19
       
Janet McNew has skillfully analyzed Oliver’s  romantic inheritance, pointing out her resistance to the “male” romantic  tradition of “achieving an identity that transcends nature.” [30]  With her “unpatrolled ego boundaries,” Oliver “avoid[s] the anxious  either/or questions which run through much male nature poetry.” [31]  McNew’s analysis, however, challenges some feminist critics, who are  wary of the female poet’s identification with nature. [32]  To them, Oliver may sound too much, not like Thel, but like the Cloud  or the Lilly or the Clod of Clay: too willing to lose herself in the  natural cycle. Indeed, her poem “October” celebrates the speaker’s  disappearance into, or out of, the natural world. After a fox passes by,  apparently without seeing her, she thinks: “so this is the world. / I’m  not in it. / It is beautiful” (NS 62). We note immediately the contrast with Blake’s proverb “Where man is not nature is barren” (E 38). [33]  Yet Oliver does not say that the world is beautiful because she is not  in it. Rather, as Burton-Christie notes, “nature does not need us to be  what it is.” He further points out the irony in which the speaker  maintains her subjectivity in order to make that aesthetic  judgment. [34] Graham has  a slightly different view of the same paradox: “Giving up human  subjectivity would mean … giving up the ability to mime herself into the  body of another. … Oliver’s poems suggest that we need language and  self-consciousness in order to experience stepping outside of language  and the self.” [35]
                 
20
       
According to feminist critics, romanticism’s  tension between the imagination of the self (usually male) and the  “otherness” of nature (usually female) creates a special problem for  women writers. As Margaret Homans puts it bluntly, “Mother Nature is not  a helpful model for women aspiring to be poets.” [36]  Elsewhere she writes, “the feminine figure who becomes an object by  merging with nature, dying as a result, represents the masculine  appropriation of femininity.” [37]  McNew points out that according to this principle, the woman poet can  claim voice and identity only through following the masculine model of  transcendence. She also argues, however, that Oliver negotiates a third  way, neither an alienated transcendence of the earth nor a passive  surrender to it: “Oliver’s visionary goal … involves constructing a  subjectivity that does not depend on separation from a world of objects.  Instead, she respectfully confers subjecthood on nature, thereby  modeling a kind of identity that does not depend on opposition for  definition.” [38] This strategy seems consonant with Blake’s view of a humanized universe.
                 
21
       
The subjectivity that McNew finds in Oliver appears likewise in Blake’s Milton: 
Seest thou the little winged fly, smaller than a grain of sand? It has a heart like thee; a brain open to heaven and hell, Withinside wondrous and expansive; its gates are not clos’d, I hope thine are not: hence it clothes itself in rich array; Hence thou art cloth’d with human beauty O thou mortal man. Seek not thy heavenly father then beyond the skies …. (20.27-32, E 114)
 Oliver’s “How Would You Live Then?” recalls Milton in its  celebration of a humanized nature, a landscape animated by the human  imagination. She asks, “What if a hundred rose-breasted grosbeaks / flew  in circles around your head? What if / the mockingbird came into the  house with you and / became your advisor?” [39]  The anaphoric “what if” questions are repeated often enough to shift  their effect from contrary-to-fact to “what if this is the case?” What  if the stars are shouting their names? By the end of the poem, the  object of “what if” is not the external event but “your” perception of  it: “What if you suddenly saw …? What if you finally saw …?” Though  Oliver seems much more invested than Blake in the tangible reality of  nature, she shares his understanding that perception is what makes it  real for us. And in the final lines, as she affirms the “silver of  water” and the yellow of sunflowers over money and gold, she concisely  discriminates between the two possibilities for nature in Blake: the  negating materialism that closes the senses, and the visionary openness  in which a grain of sand contains a world.

Looking Again at Blake, Nature, and Environmentalism 
What, then, of Blake’s notorious hostility to nature? When, in Jerusalem,  Luvah separates from Vala and “the vast form of Nature like a serpent  rolld between” (E 193), what we call “nature” is created by the division  of the “male” subject from the “female” object. When created things  harden into opacity, into “single vision” (E 202), Blake calls that  “nature.” Kevin Hutchings has persuasively argued that Blake’s suspicion  of nature is directed not toward its material reality but rather toward  the ways in which human beings have constructed, named, and exploited  it. [40] Blake never denigrates the minute particulars of the clod, the pebble, or the fly, only “nature” as an abstraction.

                 
23
       
Oliver, though often classified (even dismissed)  as a “nature poet,” similarly avoids referring to nature in that  abstract way. Her poems are filled with minute particulars: in “The  Summer Day,” she replaces the generic phrase “the grasshopper” with “This grasshopper” (HL  60, italics mine). At the same time, her encounters with vultures,  skunks, roses, and turtles take her to the edge of anthropomorphism  while recognizing the limits of complete identification in a fallen  universe. In “Entering the Kingdom,” the speaker wants to dissolve into  the bare attention of the Buddha, “To learn something by being nothing /  A little while but the rich / Lens of attention.” She is blocked,  however, by her persistent human otherness: 
But the crows puff their feathers and cry Between me and the sun, And I should go now. They know me for what I am. No dreamer, No eater of leaves. [41]
 Her dilemma places her exactly where Blake finds humanity, avoiding both  extremes of solipsism and dissolution of self. As Hutchings says, “it  is in the attainment of a balanced relationship between self and  not-self that one may develop a healthy sympathy for the things of the  earth without violating the integrity or minute particularity of one’s  own determinate form or identity.” [42]  In other words, the speaker of “Entering the Kingdom” does not fail in  her quest, but the tables are turned on her. She goes into the forest to  “learn something,” to know, but instead she is known. Without the  other, there could be no knowing. “Where man is not nature is barren”  because there is none to know it. Oliver turns the tables on Blake here  as well: without nature, there is none to know the speaker, no reference  point to define herself. As Ryan Cull points out, she avoids the  dangers not only of romanticism but also of postmodern irony and  solipsism: “Navigating between such extremes, her high achievement is to  approach nature through poetic discourse, but in a way that almost  allows nature to talk back.” [43]  Almost, because she is aware, as we are, that what the crows “know” is a  projection of her own mind, just as the speaker in Blake’s “Infant Joy”  projects a voice for the voiceless infant (E 16). The other remains  ultimately unknowable: that is “the white fire of a great mystery” (HL 59). Like Blake, Oliver rejects the easy (and sometimes dangerous) absorption of or by the other.
                 
24
       
Ultimately, Oliver’s appropriations of Blake help  us to understand both poets more effectively, seeing past the “apparent  surfaces” (E 39) of their interactions with nature. The juxtaposition  of Blake’s more “mystical” moments with Oliver’s earthy realism has the  dual function of grounding Blake’s visions and transfiguring Oliver’s  mundane encounters. We might view Oliver as “translating” Blake (at  least a portion of Blake) for the modern reader. She seizes Blake’s  ringing assertion that “every thing that lives is holy” and takes it off  the illuminated page and into the luminous world of the everyday: the  woods, fields, and shores of her Cape Cod home. In other words, she  offers one example of how a person might “live” Blake’s vision in this  world. As a poet who happens to be a woman, she also inherits a legacy  from Blake that differs from the prophetic and apocalyptic emphasis of  Ginsberg. Oliver’s imagination is no less prophetic, no less radical,  but it is radical in the sense of “root”: rooted in the life she sees  around her and her effort to see what she calls “the untrimmable light  // of the world” (WIWE 59) with visionary eyes. Her dialogue  with Blake helps us not only to reevaluate the politics of nature and  gender in Blake’s work, but also to see that work as a living thing,  subject to revision by both readers and writers in the eternal  conversation he calls Jerusalem.
                 
25
       
As fascinating as such dialogue is to a literary  scholar, the stakes are far higher in the conversation about (and  between) humanity and nature. As Sylvia Bowerbank puts it, “in our age  of ecological crisis, an ideal of transcendence of nature … is no less  problematic than the ideal of ‘harmony with nature.’” [44]  In other words, both the spiritual estrangement from nature and the  false ideal of absorption into it become obstacles to surmounting  ecological challenges. Bowerbank cites the writings of Martin W. Lewis  and others in promoting a “Promethean environmentalism,” [45]  humanity’s active management of the planet, in order to slow or reverse  the damages already done. Without such management, in Blake’s terms,  nature will be barren. Hence, the conversation between Blake and Oliver  has ramifications far beyond the scholar’s study or the poet’s morning  walk.
                 
26
       
Oliver gracefully declines the suggestion that  she is an environmentalist: “My work doesn’t document any of the sane  and learned arguments for saving, healing, and protecting the earth for  our existence. What I write begins and ends with the act of noticing and  cherishing, and it neither begins nor ends with the human world.” In  the same passage, she resists the common distinctions between human and  inhuman, animate and inanimate. If she speaks of “rescu[ing] the world,”  it is because, like Blake, she sees nature not as an object of rescue, a  damsel in distress, but as part of ourselves: “The man who does not  know nature, who does not walk under the leaves as under his own roof,  is partial and wounded.” [46]  Blake would have to agree: “‘All things Begin and End in Albions  Ancient Druid Rocky Shore.’ / … / ‘But now the Starry Heavens are fled  from the mighty limbs of Albion’” (E 171). For both Blake and Oliver, in  their different modes, the poet’s task is to make the reader aware both  of our fallen estrangement from nature and of our integral connection  to it. Both present a world in which the choice between humanity and  nature can only be a false one.

William Blake, George Romney, and The Life of George Romney, Esq.
         
By Morton D. Paley
         
Morton D. Paley’s most recent publications are “William Blake and Chichester” in Blake in Our Time, ed. Karen Mulhallen (University of Toronto Press, 2010) and the Blake chapter of The Cambridge Companion to English Poets, ed. Claude Rawson (Cambridge University Press, 2011). He is continuing his research on Blake’s middle years.

William and Catherine Blake returned to London in  September 1803, after spending three years in the seaside village of  Felpham in Sussex. During the two years that followed, one of William’s  most important and time-consuming occupations was assisting William  Hayley with the illustrations to be engraved for Hayley’s Life of George Romney.  Blake had commissions for two of these and hoped for more. These  activities were no mere task for Blake, who praised the gifts of “our  admired Sublime Romney” [1]  and thought, unfairly, that Romney’s talent had been diverted from  history to portrait painting by Hayley, asserting in a frank letter to  his brother James that Hayley “thinks to turn me into a Portrait Painter  as he did Poor Romney” (30 January 1803, E 725). In the extraordinary  letter that Blake wrote to Hayley about his renewal of vision “on the  day after visiting the Truchsessian Gallery of pictures,” he stated: “I  can, with confidence, promise you ocular demonstration of my altered  state on the plates I am now engraving after Romney, whose spiritual aid  has not a little conduced to my restoration to the light of Art.” [2]

Blake’s esteem for Romney was no doubt  intensified by the facts that he had known the older artist in the 1790s  and that there had been strong bonds between both their political  beliefs and their art at that time. True, Romney was not an easy man to  know. His friend Richard Cumberland characterized him as “shy, private,  studious and contemplative; conscious of all the disadvantages and  privations of a very stinted education; of a habit naturally  hypochondriac, with aspen nerves, that every breath could ruffle.” [3]  He had some very close friends, but it is significant that, as his old  friend Thomas Greene observed, “he seemed always to avoid associating  with Gentlemen of his Profession.” [4]  The exceptions were three artists in fields far from his own: the  sculptor John Flaxman and the miniaturists Jeremiah Meyer and (for a  time) Ozias Humphry. [5]  After 1772, when Romney showed a portrait of Humphry at the Society of  Artists, he did not participate in any further annual exhibitions, and  he never showed his work at the Royal Academy. None of these factors,  however, would have precluded friendship with Blake, who, like Romney,  was not a university man, was self-educated, and came from a  middle-class family.
                 
3
       
That Romney admired Blake’s work as early as 1784  is shown by his telling Flaxman that Blake’s historical drawings “rank  with those of Ml. Angelo.” [6]  Romney did not confine his regard to words, but paid Blake an artist’s  ultimate compliment: as Joseph Viscomi has shown in a seminal article,  in the 1790s Romney was the original purchaser of four of Blake’s  illuminated books: America copy A, The [First] Book of Urizen copy B, Visions of the Daughters of Albion copy F, and Songs of Innocence and of Experience copy A. [7]  It is unlikely that Romney could have admired Blake’s drawings and  purchased his illuminated books without ever seeing Blake himself, but  further proof that they conversed is Blake’s later statement that “In  this [“Canterbury Pilgrims”] Plate Mr B has resumed the style  with which he set out in life of which Heath and Stothard were the  awkward imitators at that time it is the style of Alb Durers Histries  and the old Engravers which cannot be imitated by any one who does not  understand Drawing and which according to Heath and Stothard  Flaxman and even Romney. Spoils an Engraver for Each of these Men have repeatedly asserted this Absurdity to me  [emphasis mine] in condemnation of my Work” (“Public Address,” E 572).  In this context Blake, at a difficult point in his life, angrily  condemns his fellow artists in a verbal shotgun blast that confounds  friend and foe alike. “Even Romney,” however, suggests that of all  people Romney should have known better. (Romney may perhaps with the  best intentions have urged an artist whose drawings ranked with  Michelangelo’s to pursue painting rather than engraving.)
                 
4
       
These facts give some credibility to an  interesting but otherwise undocumented account concerning the two  artists. Richard C. Jackson, who claimed that his father had known  Blake, asserted that Romney had presented Blake with a vine and a fig  tree from his own garden. “My father,” Jackson wrote, “told me that the  dear Blake, while resident at Hercules Buildings, Lambeth, that he  should say the one joyaunce of Blake’s life was when he had a garden of  his own and could bask in the sunshine ’neath his own vine—a vine which  had been presented to him by the artist Romney (he died on the 15th November, 1802 even as his other friend, Ozias Humphries [sic],  R.A., died eight years later). This vine, I was given to understand,  was grafted from the great vine at Versailles or Fontainbleau.” [8] Jackson is a frequently unreliable narrator, [9]  and his account can be only supplementary to the hard evidence about  Romney’s relationship with Blake. However, a few aspects of his  statement lend it support, some by omission. Romney had indeed visited  Versailles, in 1764, in the company of the great painter of seascapes  Claude-Joseph Vernet, [10]  although there is no mention of his taking a cutting from a grapevine  there. Jackson introduces Humphry, whose name he misspells, because he  was “his [Blake’s] other friend.” Blake had considerably more than two  friends, but Humphry is no doubt linked with him here because he too  purchased works by Blake in the mid-1790s. [11]  Whatever its ultimate origin, Jackson supposes that the vine came from  “some place in the country which Romney had, and had given up at or  about the time of Blake becoming resident at Lambeth.” His guess is half  right. The “place in the country” would have been Pine Apple Place in  Kilburn, “in a new garden ground,” as Romney wrote to Hayley in June  1793, “where I work two hours in advancing my designs (for my series of  large pictures).” [12]  Romney had not vacated it but had, rather, just rented it, and a vine,  as Jackson says, “might have come from Romney’s country home.” Jackson  is hard put to account for how a vine under which Blake could sit could  have grown to that size in so short a time, but that is because he  assumes there could be only one vine in Blake’s garden. Alexander  Gilchrist had written of the “fine vine” that “Blake would on no account  prune”; [13] Jackson  pictures Blake as “rejoicing … not only to sit beneath its shade, but  beneath his own fig tree also—both vine and fig tree coming from  Romney’s garden.” Again, it is less likely that this fig tree had an  abnormal growth rate than that Romney gave Blake a cutting. (Gilchrist,  however, says nothing about a fig tree.) Furthermore, the fact that  Jackson seems unaware of the political symbolism of Romney’s gift may  again suggest that there is some truth behind the story. [14]

The fruits of the earth furnished abundant  imagery to advocates of revolution in the late eighteenth century, not  least to Blake, as near the end of America, where, after the  victory of fiery Orc, the females “feel the nerves of youth renew, and  desires of ancient times, / Over their pale limbs as a vine when the  tender grape appears” (15.25-26, E 57). The yoking of vine and fig tree  is especially important, signifying the peace and freedom of a  millennial society. Its source is of course the Old Testament, as in  Micah 4.4: “But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his  fig tree; and none shall make [them] afraid: for the mouth of the LORD  of hosts hath spoken [it].” [15]  Such biblical texts became part of millennialist and pro-revolutionary  discourse even before the American and French Revolutions. As early as  1769, the novelist Henry Brooke speculated how, under the reign of  Liberty, “would industry be encouraged to plant and multiply the vine  and the fig-tree! how would benignity rejoice to call neighbours and  strangers to come and fearlessly partake of the fruits thereof!” [16]  George Washington wrote to the congregation of the Newport, Rhode  Island, synagogue that in the new republic, “every one shall sit in  safety under his own vine and figtree, and there shall be none to make  him afraid.” [17]  Appropriating the figure for his own purposes, Napoleon told his army of  Italy in 1796: “When France gives peace to the world … each of you at  his own hearthstone, under his own vine and fig tree, will be enjoying  the prosperity won by your valor ….” [18] Conversely, in the fallen world that Blake describes in Jerusalem, members of the community can no longer meet “beneath the Vine and Fig-tree” (18.19, E 163).
                 
6
       
Romney and Hayley visited France as admirers of  the revolution in 1790, and Hayley wrote of that time in language that  may remind us of the famous passage beginning “O pleasant exercise of  hope and joy!” in Wordsworth’s Prelude : “It was a time when  that scene of astonishing vicissitudes presented to the friends of  peace, of freedom, and of the arts, a spectacle of chearful curiosity,  and of hope so magnificent in promises of good to mankind, that  philanthropy could not fail to exult in the recent prospect, unconscious  that the splendid vision was destined to sink in the most execrable  horrors of barbarity and blood.” [19]  Romney too felt great enthusiasm for the early republic but was  appalled by the September Massacres, writing to Hayley on 8 September  1792: “The accounts to day from France are dreadful: all the priests  that were confined are murdered, perhaps the city of Paris is at this  time in flames. I am so agitated with the tremendous situation of that  poor Country, I am not able to do any thing.” [20]  Nevertheless, Romney retained his radical sympathies at home, as was  well known to his friends, and to some extent to the public as  well. [21] He was a  friend of Thomas Paine, who sometimes lay low at Romney’s house, and who  was indicted for sedition on 21 May 1792. [22] A few weeks after that the Morning Chronicle  reported that Romney was painting Paine’s portrait, “but whether for an  individual likeness or as the hero of Paradise Lost is not stated.  Those, however, who have seen the sketch say it’s ‘devilish  like.’” [23] (It appears that the Chronicle, like Blake in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, regarded Satan as the hero of Paradise Lost, although for different reasons.) In 1793 this painting (now untraced) was reproduced in a fine engraving by William Sharp (illus. 1), showing a smiling Paine beside the manuscript of Rights of Man. [24] For his part, Blake names Paine four times among the defenders of freedom in America,  published in the same year as Sharp’s engraving, and was to defend him  vehemently in marginalia written some five years later. [25] Whether or not Blake walked the streets of London wearing the red cap of Liberty, [26] he gave expression to his revolutionary sympathies in the figure of Orc, who defeats the British army in America, and then appears “in the vineyards of red France” in Europe  (1794; 15.2, E 66). Both Romney and Blake would have been conscious  that the gift of vine and fig tree was a symbolic act, affirming their  common adherence to a great popular cause.

Aside from their politics, it may at first  surprise us that Blake had such respect for Romney’s art. Romney was of  course one of the leading portrait artists of his time. Many of his  paintings have true elegance and grace, and sometimes, as Alex Kidson  says of The Leigh Family (1768, National Gallery of Victoria), “an almost disturbing intensity of vision.” [27]  His success, both artistic and financial, was enormous. Nevertheless,  Romney was strongly attracted to another kind of art. In February 1787  he wrote to Hayley: “This cursed portrait-painting! How I am shackled  with it! I am determined to live frugally, that I may enable myself to  cut it short, as soon as I am tolerably independent, and then give my  mind up to those delightful regions of imagination.” [28]  By that closing phrase, which has become famous in Romney studies, he  meant what was in his time called “history painting”—a term that could  include, in addition to strictly historical subjects, scenes from  Milton, the Bible, Shakespeare, and mythology. Indeed, he had visited  those regions from the beginning of his career, as in Lear in the Tempest Tearing Off His Robes  (c. 1761, Abbot Hall Art Gallery, Kendal). Although Romney was a  dedicated and highly successful portrait artist, having received 593  sittings in 1783 alone, [29]  he was nevertheless conflicted about his artistic vocation. Money alone  was not the reason, although it certainly was a factor. In 1795 the  diarist Joseph Farington wrote that Romney was reportedly worth the very  considerable sum of £50,000. [30]  He would have earned this almost entirely through portraiture, for it  was notoriously difficult to sell history paintings. Romney knew himself  to be a great portrait artist, and he was a perfectionist, said seldom  to allow any other hand to touch his work at a time when it was common  for artists to employ specialists in landscape backgrounds or draperies.  He would rather lose an important commission, as he did Mrs. Siddons’s,  than finish a picture in haste. [31] When Blake accused Hayley of turning Romney into a portrait painter, he was simplifying a complex situation.

What would have been most important to Blake  about Romney’s art? Flaxman, who contributed a “Sketch of Romney’s  Professional Character” to Hayley’s Life, points the direction.  “His cartoons,” Flaxman wrote, “some of which have unfortunately  perished, were examples of the sublime and terrible, at that time  perfectly new in English art. The dream of Atossa, from the Persians of  Æschylus, contrasted the death-like sleep of the Queen, with the  Bacchanalian Fury of the Genius of Greece. The composition was conducted  with the fire and severity of a Greek bas-relief: the ghost of Darius,  with the Persians prostrated before him, awed the spectator by grandeur  and mystery” (illus. 2). [32]  The picture Flaxman mentions is one of a group of large, finished  drawings in black chalk or graphite, begun by Romney not long after his  return from Italy in 1775 and continued over a period of perhaps a  decade. [33] “His  compositions,” Flaxman continued, “like those of the ancient pictures,  and basso relievos, told their story by a single group of figures in the  front, whilst the back ground is made the simplest possible, rejecting  all unnecessary episode, and trivial ornament, either of secondary  groups or architectural subdivision.” These were also Blake’s artistic  concerns early in his career (and at times afterwards), and Blake also  shared with Romney, Flaxman, and others both a strongly neoclassical  style and techniques of pen and wash draftsmanship. As Jean H. Hagstrum,  one of the few to have taken up this subject, argues, “a linear and  thematic stamp from Romney is visible on Blake’s works from the early Tiriel to the very late Dante illustrations.” [34]

At the time that Blake began looking for Romney  pictures to be engraved, the state of Romney’s oeuvre was almost  chaotic. Even while the artist was alive, some of it had been subjected  to terrible treatment in Romney’s move to Hampstead on Christmas 1798.  In the words of one biographer, “for want of adequate room, the pictures  were crammed into all vacant places, or arranged along the arcade,  where, being exposed in the open air to the alternate action of moisture  and frost, they were almost entirely destroyed in the course of the  winter; several, also, were stolen.” [35]  The chaos of Romney’s studio was no doubt related to, and in a sense  mirrored, the bipolar disorder that increasingly afflicted him. We can  only imagine what happened after he left Hampstead not long afterward  and then died in Kendal in November 1802. Benjamin West was so horrified  by the state of Romney’s paintings that he began cleaning and arranging  his own, he told Farington, so that “in case He should drop,  His House may not be found like those of Romney and Opie full of  rubbish that it was disgraceful to them to have brought forward to a  sale.” [36] In undertaking to search for Romney’s originals, Blake took on what would be a difficult and time-consuming task.

He began with William Saunders, who had physical  custody of most of Romney’s unsold paintings. (Saunders was Romney’s  framemaker from 1782 on, and the two had enjoyed a close business  relationship.) [37] Blake  mentions calling on Saunders on Hayley’s behalf in letters to Hayley of  26 October and 13 December 1803, 21 March 1804, and 11 December 1805.  After his first visit, Blake reported: 
I have been with Mr. Saunders who has now in his possession  all Mr. Romney’s pictures that remained after the sale at Hampstead; I  saw Milton and his Daughters, and ’Twas where the Seas were Roaring, and a beautiful Female head.  He has promised to write a list of all that he has in his possession,  and of all that he remembers of Mr. Romney’s paintings, with notices  where they now are, as far as his recollection will serve. The picture  of Christ in the Desert he supposes to be one of those which he  has rolled on large rollers. He will take them down and unroll them,  but cannot do it easily, as they are so large as to occupy the whole  length of his workshop, and are laid across beams at the top. (E 737)
 Three of these paintings can be identified (as Romney executed numerous  beautiful female heads, it is impossible to say which Blake saw). Milton and His Daughters  (private collection), depicting the blind Milton being read to, would  have made for an excellent engraving because of its dramatic lights and  darks, but it was not chosen, perhaps because it had already been  engraved by Benjamin Smith in 1795. ’Twas Where [sic] the Seas Were Roaring  was no. 117 in the 1807 sale of Romney’s paintings, described as “a  despondent Female, seated upon a Rock, overpowered with Grief; a gleam  of Light is thrown upon the Breast and Arms of the Female with Richest  effect.” [38] A detail of the large, rolled-up picture of Christ in the desert, known under the title of The Temptation in the Wilderness,  was later engraved, though not by Blake, for Hayley’s biography; it  will be discussed below with the other illustrations for the book.

Saunders was as good as his word, though not  until 5 January 1804, when he wrote to Hayley that at Blake’s request he  had made a list of Romney’s “most Capital paintings” with their  owners. [39] The first  whom Blake had called on was the astronomer and lecturer Adam Walker, a  member of the Unincreasable Club, an informal group including Romney who  dined and went to the theater together from time to time. [40]  One of Romney’s oldest friends, Walker had been with the artist in  Lancaster and had posed for some of his pictures there. The closeness of  their relationship is epitomized by two paintings and the span of time  between them. Walker was the subject of what may have been Romney’s  earliest portrait, [41] while The Walker Family  (National Portrait Gallery, London), showing Walker and his wife and  daughter poring over an astronomical chart while Walker’s sons discuss  what they have seen through a telescope pointed toward the night sky, is  among Romney’s very last works. On 27 January 1804 Blake reported to  Hayley that he had called on Walker, but that Walker was away on an  extended trip to Birmingham (E 740). After one more unsuccessful  attempt, Blake could at last write to Hayley on 4 May 1804: 
I have seen the elder Mr. Walker. … Mr. Walker showed me  Romney’s first attempt at oil painting; it is a copy from a Dutch  picture—Dutch boor smoking; on the back is written, “This was the first  attempt at oil painting by G. Romney.” He shew’d me also the last  performance of Romney. It is of Mr. Walker and family, the draperies put  in by somebody else. It is a very excellent picture, but unfinished.  The figures as large as life, half length, Mr. W., three sons, and, I  believe, two daughters, with maps, instruments, andc. Mr. Walker also  shew’d me a portrait of himself (W.), whole length, on a canvas about  two feet by one and a half; it is the first portrait Romney ever  painted. But above all, a picture of Lear and Cordelia, when he  awakes and knows her,—an incomparable production, which Mr. W. bought  for five shillings at a broker’s shop; it is about five feet by four,  and exquisite for expression; indeed, it is most pathetic; the heads of  Lear and Cordelia can never be surpassed, and Kent and the other  attendant are admirable; the picture is very highly finished. (E 748)

                 
12
       
Lear and Cordelia (location unknown) was  one of the early pictures that Romney sold by lottery in Kendal in  1762. It had been won by a Mr. Richardson in Cartmel, and by coincidence  was bought by Adam Walker’s son in a shop in Kensington many years  later. [42] William Pressly remarks that a sketch on a related subject, The Death of Cordelia  (1775-77, Folger Shakespeare Library), “exhibits a stately,  classicizing elegance, whose languid curves and slow rhythms exerted  such a strong influence on William Blake.” [43] One might well think of Blake’s early watercolor Lear and Cordelia in Prison (c. 1779) in this regard. On 28 May 1804 Blake informed Hayley that Walker “says that I shall have Lear and Cordelia  to copy if you desire it should be done” (E 750). Despite the  availability of the painting and Blake’s admiration of it, it was not to  be included among the designs engraved for Hayley’s Life.

Daniel Braithwaite, another Unincreasable and one  of Romney’s first patrons, was an official in the post office when  Romney met him shortly after moving to London in March 1762. Hayley was  to dedicate his Life of Romney to him. Blake visited him by 23  February 1804, when he informed Hayley: “He gives a very spirited  assurance of Mr John Romneys interesting himself in the great object of  his Fathers Fame and thinks that he must be proud of such a work and  in such hands. The Picture from Sterne which you desired him to procure  for you; he has not yet found where it is. Supposes that it may be in  the north and that he may learn from Mr Romney who will be in town soon—” (E 741). “Mr  Romney” is the painter’s son, John, and “in the north” refers to John’s  residence in Kendal, where he kept some of his father’s art. More must  be said about John Romney shortly. Braithwaite showed Blake “a very fine  Portrait of Mrs Siddons (by Romney) as the Tragic Muse half length. that is the Head and hands. and in his best Style” (E 741-42). [44]  This beautiful, though unfinished, painting might have been engraved  splendidly, but evidently Hayley was not interested. A suggestion from  Braithwaite did, however, catch his attention. “He also desires me,”  wrote Blake, “to express to you his wish that you would give the Public  an Engraving of that Medallion by your Sons matchless hand which is  placd over his chimney piece.” Hayley had already decided to include  this, writing to Flaxman as early as 7 August 1803 that he had Blake in  mind as the engraver of both the medallion and of Romney’s  self-portrait, but was “astonished” by Blake’s asking thirty guineas for  the former and forty guineas for the latter. [45]  It appears that Blake continued to hope to engrave the medallion, but  he accepted the inevitable by 7 August 1804, writing to Hayley that  “Miss. W[atson]. would Engrave your Sons Medallion of Romney most  delicately.” [46]
                 
14
       
How did Hayley go about choosing what pictures should be engraved for his Life of Romney?  He evidently asked early on for advice from Flaxman, whose reply, had  Hayley followed his recommendations, might have resulted in a beautiful  book. Flaxman wrote on 2 January 1804 to remind Hayley that Hayley had  once considered a group of Romney’s cartoons “the noblest of his  Studies,” and went on to indicate some of their subjects: “A Lapland  Witch raising a Storm—Charity and her Children—Pliny and his Mother  flying from the eruption of Vesuvius—the following from Æschylus—Raising  the Ghost of Darius—Atossa’s Dream—The Furies” (BR[2] 177). He  then recommended Blake for the engraving job: “they are all well worth  etching in a bold manner which I think Blake is likely to do with great  success and perhaps at an expence that will not be burthensome—but at  any rate give him one to do first for a tryal ….” Hayley at first tried  to follow Flaxman’s advice. On 16 January he drafted a letter to John  Romney. He assured him that, although the artist had promised Hayley  “half a dozen” of these pictures, he did not wish them for himself but  merely as a loan for which he would pay carriage, specifying two from  Flaxman’s list. “I wish you would allow Mr Blake to copy two of them if  they are still in London—particularly the Lapland Witch raising a Storm a  design that our Friend Meyer used to call equal to any Figure of  Michael Angelos—and Pliny the younger with his Mother in the scene of  the Earthquake.” [47]
                 
15
       
The “Lapland Witch,” Hayley explains in the Life of Romney, could not be found. “I have mentioned this design in the poetical Epistles addrest to Romney, [48]  and had hoped to decorate this volume with a good engraving from the  cartoon, which the son of my departed friend had kindly intended to  present to me, but after a diligent search for it in a mass of many  large works, that were huddled together in the haste of the retiring  painter to clear his London house, we had the mortification to perceive,  that some mischance had annihilated this favorite design.” [49]  However, that was not true of most of the other drawings that Flaxman  recommended, and that he continued to recommend. On 22 June 1804 Blake  wrote to Hayley (E 752-53): 
Mr Flaxman named the following Eight as proper subjects for Prints 1 The Vision of Atossa from Eschylus 2 Apparition of Darius 3 Black Eyd Susan—a figure on the Sea shore embracing a Corse 4 The Shipwreck with the Man on Horseback andc which I have 5 Hecate. a very fine thing indeed, which I have 6 Pliny very fine but very unfinishd. which I have 7 Lear and Cordelia. belonging to Mr Walker 8 One other which I omitted to write down and have forgot but think that it was a Figure with Children which he calld a Charity

What were these pictures, and how suitable were they for engraved illustrations? Numbers 1 and 2 are illustrations from The Persae of Aeschylus, first published in an English translation by Robert Potter in 1777. (Flaxman’s own Compositions from the Tragedies of Aeschylus, [50] which included four illustrations of The Persae  based on Potter’s translation, was to appear eighteen years later.)  Potter sat to Romney for his portrait in 1778, and the two got on so  well that Romney made him a present of the finished portrait in August  1779. [51] Their  conversations led Romney, who often got his ideas for imaginative  subjects from friends, to make two finished drawings on subjects from The Persae.  Potter wrote in a note in his second edition, “The excellent Mr. Romney  gave a strong instance of his good sense and fine taste, when he called  Æschylus ‘the painter’s poet:’ the public may expect to see this scene,  and some others, designed by him in the genuine spirit of Æschylus; so  that the translator will have this merit, if he has no other, to have  given rise to some paintings that will do honour to our country.” [52] Romney must have been buoyed by this encouragement, as he later was by “the fervent praise” of Joseph Warton, who had seen Atossa’s Dream in London in 1794. [53] At this time, Aeschylus was valued for his “primitive” qualities, [54]  and so Romney here was at the cutting edge of contemporary taste. This  picture and its companion also show something of what Romney and Blake  had in common: Atossa’s Dream is strikingly Blake-like, as is The Ghost of Darius Appearing to Atossa.  In the latter the crowned head of Darius and his woeful expression  foreshadow Blake’s renderings of Nebuchadnezzar, and his white beard,  outstretched arms, and mantle, seen through the smoke of the altar,  anticipate Urizen. [55] The three elders, bent over on their knees to our left, anticipate Job’s slouched-over comforters in the Illustrations of the Book of Job: “Let the Day Perish Wherein I Was Born” (illus. 3) and “Then the Lord Answered Job out of the Whirlwind” (note the visible hands, which are also a detail in Romney’s drawing).

Number 3, a picture at Saunders’s according to  his list, appears to refer to John Gay’s popular lyric “Sweet William’s  Farewell to Black-Eyed Susan,” published in his Poems on Several Occasions  (1720). There is a puzzle about this title. The poem is about a woman  who boards her sailor sweetheart’s warship and takes a tearful farewell  before he sails. [56] It does not feature “a figure on the Sea shore embracing a Corse” or anything like it. According to John Romney, in about 1793 his father “painted … the Death of Ophelia, and Susan, from the ballad of ‘When the Seas were roaring;’ neither of which was in a finished state.” [57]  He also says, confusingly, that among the drawings he presented to the  Fitzwilliam Museum in 1817 were “V. 3rd. The Damsel; from the ballad,  ‘’Twas when the seas were roaring,’ andc. Or perhaps a personification  of Sorrow” and “XIII. 3rd. From the ballad, ‘’Twas when the seas were  roaring.’” [58] Gay does include a well-known ballad beginning “’Twas when the Seas were roaring,” sung by a character named Susan, [59] in his farce The What D’Ye Call It (1715).  It is about a woman who imagines the death of her lover at sea and then  sees his corpse in the water (although the corpse remains there and she  does not embrace it). Evidently either Flaxman or Blake made a slip,  conflating the titles of two well-known poems. [60] Romney’s ’Twas When the Seas Were Roaring was not selected for engraving, and its location is unknown.

“The Shipwreck,” the only engraving by Blake to appear in the Life, will be discussed with the other published illustrations. Blake had mentioned number 5 on the list, Hecate,  to Hayley earlier: “Mr. Flaxman advises that the drawing of Mr.  Romney’s which shall be chosen instead of the Witch (if that cannot be  recovered) be Hecate, the figure with the torch and snake, which he  thinks one of the finest drawings” (2 April 1804, E 745). Blake urged  Hayley to choose it over the Pliny: “The two Cartoons which I have of  Hecate and Pliny are very unequal in point of finishing the Pliny in  [is] a Sketch tho admirably contrived for an Effect equal to Rembrandt.  But the Hecate is a finishd Production which will call for all the  Engravers nicest attention” (28 December 1804, E 760). Blake continued  in a way that suggests that, after having been commissioned to engrave The Shipwreck as well as the book’s frontispiece, he was now lobbying for a chance to do Hecate:  “indeed it is more finishd than the Shipwreck it is every body[s]  favourite who have seen it and they regularly prefer it to the  Shipwreck as a work of Genius As to the [Plates] Price of the  Plates Flaxman declares to me that he will not pretend to set a price  upon Engraving. I think it can only be done by some Engraver. I  consulted Mr Parker on the subject before I decided on the  Shipwreck and it was his opinion and he says it still is so that a  Print of that size cannot be done under 30 Guineas if finishd, and if a  Sketch. 15 Guineas as therefore Hecate must be a Finishd Plate I  consider 30 Guineas as its Price and the Pliny 15 Guineas” (E 760).  (Note that “can only be done by some Engraver” refers only to getting a  price estimate from Blake’s one-time partner, James Parker.) These  prices are considerably lower than those that had astonished Hayley in  August 1803. In any event, Hecate was never engraved and its present location is unknown.
                 
19
       
Blake’s numbers 3, 4, 5, and 7 are additions to  Flaxman’s original list, and “A Lapland Witch” and “The Furies” have  been omitted. As we see, Blake had succeeded in obtaining the Pliny  drawing and another that Flaxman had recommended: Hecate. Romney’s old friend Adam Walker, having offered to let Blake borrow Lear and Cordelia,  would presumably have permitted him to engrave it. Furthermore, it  might have been possible for Hayley to borrow numbers 1 and 2, as these  were in the possession of John Romney, [61] who, according to Hayley, had been willing to allow the engraving of the lost Lapland Witch. The only picture from either list to appear in Hayley’s Life was Blake’s fine engraving of The Shipwreck,  which was among the pictures held by Saunders. Hayley’s failure to  include any of the others made a considerable difference in the  pictorial aspect of his book—an important consideration for a biography  of an artist—as did his change in priorities regarding engravers.
                 
20
       
All this time Blake had been confident of having a major role in engraving the designs for the Life of Romney.  His connection with the project had begun while he was still living in  Felpham and had executed two miniatures of Romney for Hayley, copied  from self-portraits in Hayley’s possession. [62]  From one of these he no doubt made a drawing as the basis for a  portrait engraving to serve as the book’s frontispiece. He showed a  proof of this engraving to Romney’s friends from time to time, and at  every opportunity he let Hayley know how they considered his rendering  of Romney exact. [63] In the newly rediscovered letter of 7 August 1804 he wrote: “the Plate [of The Shipwreck] goes on with Spirit and neatness as does Romneys Head.” [64]  After his artistic epiphany connected with visiting the Truchsessian  Gallery, Blake declared “I am become suddenly as I was at first,” and  that he would demonstrate this “by producing the Head of Romney and the Shipwreck  quite another thing from what you or I ever expected them to be” (23  October 1804, E 757). As late as 28 December 1804 he still expected to  be the engraver of the frontispiece. “I am very far,” he wrote to Hayley  on that date, “from shewing the Portrait of Romney as a finishd Proof.  be assured that with our Good Flaxmans good help and with your remarks  on it in addition I hope to make it a Supernaculum.” [65]  However, despite Blake’s efforts, when the book was at last published  in 1809, the frontispiece was an engraving by Caroline Watson (illus. 4), showing Romney at three different ages, and six other engravings were by Watson as well, with only one, “The Shipwreck” (illus. 5), by Blake.

Watson, who succeeded Blake in several of  Hayley’s projects during these early years of the nineteenth century,  was a highly capable graphic artist, especially of portraits. She had  been made engraver to the queen in 1785, the year in which she executed  individual portraits of two daughters of Queen Charlotte after John  Hoppner. Among her best-known works is her fine engraving of Sir Joshua  Reynolds’s bespectacled self-portrait, which appeared as the  frontispiece to the edition of Reynolds’s Works that Blake  owned and savagely annotated. Arthur M. Hind does justice to Watson’s  strengths and weaknesses in writing that “Caroline Watson … is the  miniaturist in style among the stipple engravers. Her surface is of the  closest and finest texture … and suffers from the excess of its quality,  while her design lacks grip and robustness. … She engraved one plate  for the Shakespeare Gallery, but subjects on this scale were too large for her delicate talent.” [66]  Although of course Watson was merely practicing her trade, in Blake’s  eyes her supplanting him as Hayley’s chief engraver would have been a  terrible slight; Robert Essick has suggested that for Blake she became  an aspect of the principle of domination that he called the Female  Will. [67] The first indication that Blake had of being superseded by Watson was learning that in the octavo edition of Hayley’s Life of William Cowper  (published 1806) Watson’s portrait engraving of Cowper would replace  his own. One of Blake’s miniatures after Romney’s portrait of the poet  had disturbed Lady Hesketh, Cowper’s cousin and Hayley’s friend, because  she had seen in the image a suggestion of Cowper’s insanity, which she  would not allow to be mentioned in the Life. [68] Although she later relented about Blake’s portrait engraving of the poet, finding the published engraving “Softened,” she was unequivocal in her support of Watson (BR[2]  147, 197). Blake tried to put a good face on it, writing to Hayley on  22 March 1805: “The Idea of Seeing an Engraving of Cowper by the hand of  Caroline Watson is I assure you a pleasing one to me it will be highly  gratifying to see another Copy by another hand and not only gratifying  but Improving. which is better” (E 764). These can hardly have been  Blake’s real feelings in this matter. In addition to feeling  professionally injured, he must have resented losing the fee he would  have earned for a reduced engraving. [69] The fact that Flaxman, who in 1804 had urged Hayley not to employ Watson as an engraver (BR[2] 194-95), nevertheless advised her on this engraving [70] may have appeared to Blake another betrayal.
                 
22
       
Flaxman had been candid to Hayley about his view  of Watson. He had seen two of her engravings after children’s heads by  William Beechey that were “so miserably executed that similar engraving  instead of being a decoration, would be a blemish in your Book” (16 June  1804, BR[2] 195). Indeed, Flaxman continued, “if … you still  continue in the same resolution as at first I will deliver Your  Commission but there my interference must cease and all further  communication must be between the Engraver and Yourself, because I  foresee that the conclusion of such an engagement must be unsatisfactory  to all parties concerned.” Hayley was, clearly, determined not to take  Flaxman’s advice on this matter, and in 1806 he invited Watson to  Felpham to copy some of Romney’s originals for the purpose of engraving  them in London. It is disappointing to find young Edward Garrard Marsh,  whom Blake had praised as “my much admired and respected Edward the  Bard of Oxford,” [71]  later congratulating Hayley on his choice: “Caroline Watson’s engravings  are beautiful in the extreme; and you never made a happier exchange  than when you employed her instead of Blake” (BR[2] 295).  (Hayley’s friends had a marked tendency to agree with him, unless they  were in positions of independent power as were Lady Hesketh and  Flaxman.) According to Hayley, he had been drawn to Watson by “a  peculiar tenderness of admiration, with which Romney contemplated an  exquisite engraving [by Watson] of Sir Joshua’s portrait, prefixed to  the quarto edition of his works, in 1797.” [72] Hayley may have also had another motive in inviting Watson to stay for “some weeks.” [73]  His estranged wife, Eliza, had died in 1797, and evidently he had no  inclination to remain “The Hermit,” as he liked to sign himself,  literally. In 1801 he was thought to be about to marry Penelope Carleton  Chetwynd, an attractive widow (born c. 1762) temporarily resident in  Felpham. [74] This did  not happen, but in October 1808 he met and courted Mary Welford, whom he  married on 28 March of the following year. [75]  Perhaps, although she may well have been unaware of it, Hayley had  earlier entertained the idea of the unmarried Caroline Watson, who was  about forty-five at the time, as a candidate. If Blake suspected this,  it would further strengthen Essick’s argument that Blake identified  Watson with the Female Will.
                 
23
       
Blake pursued Romney-related errands for Hayley  throughout 1804, which he is unlikely to have done had he not  anticipated a major role in the engraving of illustrations for the Life.  He worked on two plates for it during that year. One was after Romney’s  self-portrait for the frontispiece, the other “The Shipwreck,” after  Romney’s painting of a rescue at the Cape of Good Hope. On 16 July 1804  he sent Hayley a progress proof of the former and a sketch for the  latter (illus. 6), along with the newly published Correspondence of Samuel Richardson, [76]  which after several attempts he had succeeded in getting from its  publisher, Richard Phillips. Evidently Blake had previously disagreed  with Hayley about Richardson, for he now declared that “Richardson has  won my heart I will again read Clarissa andc they  [Richardson’s novels] must be admirable I was too hasty in my perusal of  them to percieve all their beauty” (E 754). It is hard to believe that  this profession can be entirely sincere, coming from a man who had  written just a few years earlier (of Henry Boyd’s moralistic view of the Odyssey),  “If Homers merit was only in these Historical combinations and Moral  sentiments he would be no better than Clarissa” (E 633). Of the book’s  frontispiece to volume one, engraved after Joseph Highmore by Watson,  Blake declared: “I admire Miss Watsons head of Richardson it is truly  delicate ‘The patient touches of unwearid Art’” (E 754). Delicacy could  be Watson’s specialty, but this is a very ordinary stipple engraving; in  quoting Pope’s description of a monument to Virgil in The Temple of Fame, Blake, who disliked Pope and abominated Virgil, [77] was no doubt engaging in a private joke while humoring Hayley, who was still a potential source of engraving commissions.

Hayley’s Life of Romney contains twelve  engraved illustrations, ten of them after Romney. The only Blake  engraving to be included was “The Shipwreck,” dated 14 April 1809, [78]  though finished no later than 1805. The original oil sketch (location  unknown) is called “animated tho’ unfinished” by Hayley, who says that  the subject was suggested to Romney by the Rev. James Stanier  Clarke. [79] The story comes from a book by the Swedish botanist and travel writer Carl Peter Thunberg, Travels in Europe, Africa, and Asia, Made between the Years 1770 and 1779. [80]  Thunberg presents the story of a shipwreck off the Cape of Good Hope as  involving “action that does great honour to humanity.” Seeing the  victims offshore, “an old man, of the name of Woltemad,  by birth an European, … borrowed a horse, and … resolved to ride … to  the wreck, with a view of saving some of them.” Woltemad’s heroism ended  tragically. “He repeated this dangerous trip six times more, bringing  each time two men alive on shore, and thus saved in all fourteen  persons. The horse was by this time so much fatigued, that he did not  think it prudent to venture out again; but the cries and intreaties of  the poor wretches on the wreck increasing, he ventured to take one trip  more, which proved so unfortunate, that he lost his own life ….”
                 
25
       
Romney would have been interested in this story  for its humanitarian content—Victor Chan links it to his many drawings  connected with the prison reformer John Howard. James Stanier Clarke was  certainly aware of the story, for he commissioned the first published  illustration of the scene in his capacity as an editor of the Naval Chronicle.  A copy of Romney’s picture by his student, Isaac Pocock, Jr., was used  as the basis for an aquatint, “Shipwreck at the Cape of Good Hope” by  Thomas Medland, which appeared in the Naval Chronicle in 1800. [81]  According to the accompanying text, Pocock’s drawing was taken “from  the large Painting by George Romney, Esq. in his Gallery at Hampstead.” Thus Blake’s was not the first print after Romney’s Shipwreck.  It is, however, both clearer and more spirited than Medland’s, showing a  swirl of motion among the victims of the wreck and the heroic horseman  who has ridden into the waves to help them. A striking difference  between Thunberg’s account and Romney’s representation is the age of the  hero. Thunberg stresses the advanced age of Woltemad, calling him a  “worthy veteran” and a “hoary sire.” However, Blake’s print (like  Medland’s) shows a powerful, muscular young man fighting the waves.  Romney probably thought this a more dramatic visual concept. It may also  be, as Chan interestingly speculates, that Romney thought of Woltemad  as a Christ figure rescuing souls. [82]

“The Shipwreck” was the only engraving Blake  contributed to Hayley’s biography. Seven of the remaining eleven were by  Watson. Despite his early and prolonged involvement with the Romney  project, Blake had been superseded by a highly successful stipple  engraver and placed among other contemporaries who were competent at  best. This appears to mark a more general cooling of Hayley toward  Blake’s work after Blake left Felpham. It may be that Hayley was happy  to cut his ties with the vates irritabilis and found relief in  working with an engraver who had no claims to inspiration. Another  instance of Hayley’s withdrawal from Blake may be seen in the thirteenth  edition of his perennial best-seller The Triumphs of Temper.  For the twelfth edition (1803) Blake had executed new engravings after  six engaging designs by Maria Flaxman. These replaced the Thomas  Stothard illustrations that had been engraved by William Sharp, James  Heath, and James Neagle and used in the six previous editions. In 1807 Triumphs  appeared in a thirteenth edition, one (very rare) printing of which  features the Flaxman-Blake images, another the engravings after Stothard  previously published. [83]  It appears that Hayley changed horses in midstream, eliminating Blake’s  engravings after Maria Flaxman’s decidedly superior drawings and going  back to their banal predecessors for the rest of the thirteenth  edition. [84] The reason  for this unusual procedure appears to be that Blake’s copperplates  showed unexpected signs of early wear. Essick remarks that “the plates  are quite worn in the 1807 edition” and specifies that in plate 6 “the 4  cm. horizontal scratch, running 2.5 cm. above the lower margin of the  design, wore off the plate in the course of the 1803 printing and thus  appears as only a faint shadow line in the 1807 edition.” [85]
                 
27
       
The problem with Blake’s plates for The Triumphs of Temper is likely to have influenced Hayley at a time when he was deciding on the engravers for his Life of Romney,  especially if he was already disposed to be so influenced. Hayley even  stated to Flaxman (through what Bentley calls “a semi-literate  amanuensis”) “I should like to employ your Freand Cromak on the Ship  wreck you mention,” and was deterred only by the fact that Blake had  already taken the picture home from Saunders’s: “I should be sorry to  risque wounding the Feelings of our quick-spirited Freand by sending the  oil sketch from his possassion to the House of any other  Engraver.” [86] Had it  not been for Blake’s assiduity in carrying out Hayley’s requests, the  book might have appeared with none of his engravings!
                 
28
       
When we turn to the book itself, we find the  engravings of surprisingly varying quality, considering the time and  trouble it had taken to locate some of the originals. Watson’s  frontispiece that displaced the portrait engraving on which Blake had  been working, and for which he had even been paid, [87]  is an excellent piece of work, showing three heads of Romney, all from  self-portraits in Hayley’s possession, at different ages. The largest of  the originals (1784, National Portrait Gallery, London), which conveys a  fine sense of the artist’s high-strung and vulnerable nature, has  justly been called “one of the greatest self-portraits of the eighteenth  century.” [88] The other  two are identified by John Ingamells as a watercolor (untraced) drawn  at Eartham in 1778 of Romney wearing a bicorne or tricorne hat, and a  crayon drawing of a bespectacled Romney (also untraced) of 1799. [89] All three heads are sensitively rendered as to both contour and expression.
                 
29
       
Watson also engraved The Infant Shakespeare, a picture that has less to do with Shakespeare than with Thomas Gray’s Progress of Poesy, in which “Far from the sun and summer-gale, / In thy [Albion’s] green lap was Nature’s darling laid.” [90]  It shows two females, Comedy (based on Emma Hart) and Tragedy, trying  to teach a baby to play a flageolet, supplying, as Richard Altick puts  it, “the element of allegory that was, at that time, indispensable to  any celebration of Shakespeare.” [91]  The original (purchased by Lord Egremont and now at Petworth) was  exhibited in Boydell’s Shakespeare Gallery and engraved by Benjamin  Smith (1803). The version Watson engraved belonged to Francis Newbery,  whom Hayley thanks. [92]
                 
30
       
Much admired in its time—Hayley pronounced it his favorite Romney [93]—The Infant Shakespeare is  more difficult to appreciate in our own, hovering as it does between  charm and silliness. Watson’s placing her subject in an oval frame is  perhaps an attempt to emphasize the former and ward off the latter by  underlining the consciously fictive nature of the scene. Watson also  produced a very competent engraving, from Maria Denman’s drawing, of  Thomas Alphonso Hayley’s portrait medallion. Unfortunately, her other  engravings for the book are in some ways problematic. The fault was not  entirely hers, for Hayley must have had the deciding voice in choosing  her subjects. [94]
                 
31
       
Among the pictures Watson copied during her visit to Felpham was Madame de Genlis  (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco), the subject of which Romney and  Hayley had met in Paris in 1790, and whom Romney painted in London in  1792. The author of Lessons of a Governess to Her Pupils  (London, 1792) is depicted dramatically and somewhat exotically, wearing  a large scarf on her head and a shawl over her shoulders. Watson failed  to find a graphic equivalent for the delicate, pastel-like coloring of  the original, and her portrayal seems vulgar by comparison. Three other  engravings are after works owned by Hayley for which Hart alone had  served as a model: “Miranda,” “Cassandra,” and “Sensibility.” The head  of Miranda [95] is similar to that in Romney’s large Tempest painting for the Shakespeare Gallery, now existing only in fragmentary form. [96]  Watson’s engraving suffers especially from having no equivalent to the  lushly contrasting reds of Miranda’s hair, gown, and lips. Cassandra too was modeled by Hart for exhibition in Boydell’s Shakespeare Gallery (though begun earlier), [97] this time ostensibly illustrating Troilus and Cressida.  Another version was sold in the 1807 Romney sale; both are untraced,  and the full-length picture is known only through Francis Legat’s line  engraving, dated 1 January 1795. In this instance Romney produced at  least three heads of his subject, [98] one of which was owned by Hayley. Watson no doubt took the opportunity to copy it in 1806. [99]  Cassandra’s hair in Watson’s engraving is considerably wilder than it  is in the Boydell painting (as known through Legat’s engraving), as it  also is in the surviving small painting (Tate Britain), and the  engraving is more melodramatic than dramatic. Sensibility (Jay I. Kislak Foundation), [100]  painted in 1786, began as a beautiful head; Hayley claims credit for  encouraging Romney to transform it to full length: “You have only to  enlarge your canvas,” he told Romney, “introduce the shrub mimosa,  growing in a vase, with a hand of this figure approaching its leaves,  and you may call your picture a personification of Sensibility.” Hayley  says that he then hastened to “an eminent nurseryman at Hammersmith” and  returned with the mimosa that the artist painted in the lower  right. [101] Watson in  her engraving brought the picture back to a head alone, but retained  its botanical element by moving the mimosa close in (possibly as a wall  painting). Hayley afterwards acquired the original as part of a  real-estate transaction. [102]
                 
32
       
It may seem surprising that of the ten plates after Romney in Hayley’s Life, three were heads of Emma Hart. It is true that Hayley genuinely admired Romney’s famous (by the time he wrote the Life)  model, writing that “her features, like the language of Shakespeare,  could exhibit all the feelings of nature, and all the gradations of  every passion, with a most fascinating truth, and felicity of  expression,” [103] but  he may also have thought that the inclusion of several heads of her in  various roles would increase the public’s interest in his book. Although  Hart was known only to a small circle when Romney painted her, [104]  by the time Hayley chose the subjects for his book she was Lady  Hamilton, who had become famous for her “attitudes” and for having been  the mistress of Admiral Horatio Nelson. Her original poses for Romney  anticipated the attitudes, and for readers of The Life of Romney these prints would look back to them evocatively.
                 
33
       
The remaining engravings were by William Haines,  Abraham Raimbach, Robert Mitchell Meadows, and Robert Cooper. The  earliest Romney painting reproduced in the book was The Introduction of Dr. Slop into the Parlour of Mr. Shandy (location  unknown). The engraver was Haines, who had been abroad for several  years and had returned to England from Philadelphia as late as 1805.  Blake evidently knew Haines, who was probably the subject of his epigram 
The Sussex Men are Noted Fools  And weak is their brain pan  I wonder if H——the painter  Is not a Sussex Man [105]

                 
34
       
Haines, who had grown up in Chichester, began as  an engraver and also became successful as a portrait artist, often in  miniatures, the art to which Hayley had attempted to recruit Blake. He  painted Hayley’s portrait (engraved by H. R. Cook) and also engraved  portraits after numerous other artists. He frequently exhibited at the  Royal Academy from 1808 on, and in 1811 his address is given in the  exhibition catalogue as 10 South Molton Street. [106]  As Blake lived at 17 South Molton Street, his animosity toward Haines  may perhaps be linked to a local quarrel rather than to art. Dr. Slop  could be, as Geoffrey Keynes suggests, “the Picture from Sterne” that  Blake told Hayley he was searching for in his letter of 23 February 1804  (E 741), [107] and Blake may already have been on the track of it when he informed Hayley that “Mr Flaxman is not at all acquainted with Sr Allan Chambre [sic]”  (27 January 1804, E 741). As it turned out, Chambré did own the  picture, having received it from the person who won it in Romney’s  Kendal lottery in 1762. [108]  “The Picture from Sterne” that Blake sought may, alternatively, have  been one of two other early paintings of Shandean subjects that Hayley  mentions. One represented the death of Lieutenant Le Fever and, as Adam  Walker told Hayley, “was much admired.” Walker continued: 
The figures were about eighteen inches long, and wonderfully  expressive. The dying lieutenant was looking at Uncle Toby (who sat  mute at the foot of the bed) and by the motion of his hand was  recommending his son to his care: The boy was kneeling by the bedside,  and with eyes that expressed his anguish of heart was, as it were,  turning from a dying to a living father, begging protection, a most  pathetic figure. Trim was standing at a distance in his usual attitude,  and with a face full of inward grief. What became of this admirable  picture I cannot tell. [109]
 Hayley adds that Romney’s friends regarded this work as “a master piece  of pathetic expression … Mr. Braithwaite …thought it the most affecting  picture he ever beheld.” But despite all efforts, the picture could not  be found. Neither could what Hayley declared was Romney’s own favorite  comic picture showing “Obadiah making his bow to Dr. Slop as the Doctor  is falling in the dirty lane.” [110]  However, Hayley declared Chambré ’s painting “a work of great comic  power.” Romney, who, while apprenticed to Christopher Steele, had  probably heard Sterne read passages from his novel in Steele’s  studio, [111]  accurately depicts Dr. Slop as described in chapters nine and ten of  volume two: “a little, squat, uncourtly figure … of about four feet and a  half perpendicular height, with a breadth of back, and a sesquipedality  of belly, which might have done honour to a serjeant in the  horse-guards. … His hinder parts, upon which he had received his fall,  totally besmear’d,—and in every other part of him, blotched over  ….” [112] Working in this comic vein was to become unusual for Romney. Haines’s engraving is one of the few records of it.
                 
35
       
Raimbach engraved a detail from a painting that Blake had looked for at Saunders’s: Romney’s large, unfinished Paradise Regained picture, The Temptation in the Wilderness.  Hayley does not shrink from giving himself credit for the original  concept. “In the year 1794, a passage in the Paradise Regained of  Milton, so forcibly struck me as full of sentiment and picture, that I  desired my son to transcribe it for Romney. It was the sublime  description of our Saviour in the wilderness.” [113] He then quotes four lines (4.422-25) of the poem: 
Infernal ghosts, and hellish furies, round Environ’d thee; some howl’d, some yell’d, some shriek’d, Some bent at thee their fiery darts, while thou Satst unappall’d in calm and sinless peace.
 Hayley had suggested to Flaxman that “if the Figure of Christ in the  wilderness … begun upon an immense Canvas is sufficiently advanced to  form a good engraving I should wish your Friend [Cromek] to shew his  powers in that ….” [114]  Either the painting was not sufficiently advanced or Raimbach lacked  the skill to render it adequately, for he shows only Christ’s head and  shoulders in what Gilchrist justly called “a poor Head of Christ.” [115] (Raimbach generously credited Blake as the better engraver of outlines, but received the commission nevertheless.) [116]  We do not know what the rest of the picture looked like, which is  especially unfortunate because Romney painted so few religious subjects.  “The picture of Christ in the Desert he [Saunders] supposes to  be one of those which he has rolled on large rollers,” wrote Blake, and  according to John Romney, it was taken to Christie’s auction rooms with  his father’s other pictures, but was never unrolled and not located  afterwards. [117]
                 
36
       
Newton with the Prism (private  collection) was strikingly engraved by Meadows, who had previously  executed engravings after Henry William Bunbury for Macklin’s Poet’s  Gallery (another venture from which Blake felt excluded). [118] John Romney gives a concise description of the painting: 
It represented that contemplative philosopher seated on the  right of the picture, attentively observing a Prism, which he holds with  his right hand in a sun-beam, and two female attendants placed  opposite; one of whom with a silly kind of laugh is expressing her  astonishment at the phenomenon of the prismatic colours projected on the  wall; while the other is in the act of carefully bringing in a caraff  of water. The composition is simple, according with the sobriety of the  subject; and the effect beautiful: the countenance of one female is in  shadow, and that of the other (the laughing girl) in a reflected light,  or demi-shade. This latter gives a fascinating charm to the  picture. [119]
 Meadows’s engraving (illus. 7)  is striking for its contrast of light and dark, which gives something  of the effect of a mezzotint, but of course the main point of Newton’s  demonstration, the diffraction of white light into spectral  colors—Hayley refers to the painting as “Newton, displaying the  prismatic colours”—cannot be conveyed in black and white. [120]  Obviously, Meadows cannot be blamed for not having done the impossible;  the question is why Hayley did not choose the picture that Romney  regarded as a companion to Newton, Milton and His Daughters,  then (according to Saunders’s list) in the collection of the brewer and  radical Samuel Whitbread, which would have been more appropriate for  monochrome. [121] Perhaps, as suggested above, Hayley avoided the Milton painting because it had already been engraved (by Benjamin Smith) for Hayley’s life of Milton. [122]

37
       
The last picture in the book is neither of nor after Romney, but an entirely conventional portrait of the budding poet [123]  and future astronomer Romney Robinson. It was painted by the subject’s  father, Romney’s friend and former pupil Thomas Robinson of Windermere,  and engraved by Cooper, a copious engraver of portraits (114 in the  National Portrait Gallery alone). Why Hayley wanted to include this  rather than another print after Romney is one of the puzzling aspects of  his book.
                 
38
       
The Life of George Romney was long in the making. Hayley advertised for materials for it as early as 28 August 1803. [124] He says he began it “about the middle of December, 1803” and finished it, after several interruptions, in October 1807. [125]  However, he had to wait for engravings to be completed and so,  self-consciously using an artist’s term, he continued to “retouch” it.  He was still “retouching the Life of Romney” early in 1808. He and the  printer, Joseph Seagrave, “revised” the first proof sheet on 27 March  1808, and this process continued for several months. Seagrave died on 9  July 1808, and his successor, Mason, printed the book, which was  published by T. Payne, London, in the late spring of 1809. Hayley sadly  remarks that it met with “surprising ill success.” [126]
                 
39
       
The reviews were mixed. The Quarterly Review savaged the book in a review by the painter John Hoppner, revised by the editor, William Gifford. [127]  The verdict: “As a literary composition, it is far below mediocrity;  and as a critique on art, flimsy and injudicious.” Romney himself was  condemned as an artist capable of only minor subjects; his figures had  “more the appearance of coloured statues, than representations of  animated nature,” and “in his manner of treating the higher walks of  history … extravagance has been mistaken for sublimity, and praised  accordingly.” “Romney’s pallet may readily be traced back to the  colour-shop.” This sheer overkill suggests that Hoppner was jealously  taking revenge on his deceased, more successful rival. As for the  reactionary Gifford, whom William Hazlitt was to call “the invisible  link, that connects literature with the police,” [128]  he was well aware that Hayley was a political liberal and that Romney  had been a friend of Paine. Whatever changes Gifford made in revising  were not likely to have been in the book’s favor.
                 
40
       
The Critical Review [129]  attempted to be more evenhanded, saying of Hayley: “His want of  compression, and his tedious habit of introducing vapid phrases, are  faults so well known, that they need not our emblazoning. On the other  hand, his good qualities, his truth, the general correctness of his  judgment, his experience of the world, and just feeling, his candour and  liberality, have not been duly appretiated [sic] by our  contemporaries.” (This last point may suggest what the public reception  of the book was.) The reviewer devoted more space than most to the  reproductions of Romney’s paintings, finding them “well chosen specimens  to exhibit the gradations of his improvement, and the peculiar  qualities of his style.” “The Miranda,” he wrote, “has exquisite  expression,” but “Sensibility is too pretty, and Cassandra too like a  Bacchante of the lowest order.” He found “the introduction of Dr. Slop  into the parlour of Mr. Shandy … too just and natural to be sufficiently  humorous.” Of “The Shipwreck” he says (not mentioning Blake) that “the  sentiment, as observed by Mr. Flaxman, is caught at a glance, the light  is happily spread upon the gloom, and the confused horrors of the scene  represented with great clearness and simplicity.” [130]  “The piece entitled Newton with the Prism … concentrates the  excellencies of Romney’s manner, namely, character, expression,  strength, delicacy, grace, simplicity, and the dexterous management of  light and shadow,” but “the head of our Saviour in the wilderness” was  “not quite equal to Milton’s description.” “The Infant Shakespeare” was  “above our praise.”
                 
41
       
The Monthly Review took a sterner line, condemning Hayley’s repetition “almost ad nauseam” of expressions like “‘the tender artist,’—‘the tender and apprehensive artist,’ (the latter is a favourite and frequent adjunct,)—‘the sensitive—the timorous,’—‘our beloved and dejected artist,’—‘the interesting invalid,’ andc.” [131] This reviewer also made an important point in observing that 
The expectations of those young artists should have been  considered, who will open the volume with sanguine hopes of discovering  the recorded opinions of one of his most distinguished countrymen on the  works of foreign art, which he frequently explored; and they will close  it with the greater disappointment, from being informed that the  professional discussions of Romney, of which no trace is here preserved,  were eloquent, original, judicious, and so full of vehemence and  enthusiasm that they frequently betrayed him into tears.
 Indeed, as Romney gave no lectures and wrote no art criticism, a  biographer who had known him for twenty-five years had an unusual  opportunity to convey both his views about art and the qualities that  made his conversation on that subject so fascinating, but evidently  Hayley did not think this part of his responsibility. The reviewer  mentioned the book’s twelve illustrations in his last paragraph, but his  only critical judgment was that Watson’s were “charmingly engraved.”
                 
42
       
In the Gentleman’s Magazine a favorable notice mostly comprised, as did many reviews of the time, a summary of the book with extracts from it. [132]  It said that the volume was “elegantly printed,” and that the  engravings were “executed principally by Caroline Watson, in a  peculiarly-elegant and highly-finished style,” listing all the  illustrations but not naming any other engravers, and concluding with a  remark that is unlikely to have pleased any of them: “These Engravings,  we cannot help adding, render this book one of the cheapest purchases  ever offered to the Publick.” The British Critic, in a mildly  positive review, closed, curiously enough, on the same note: “The  engravings by Caroline Watson, are highly spirited and beautiful, and  would, if there were a deficiency of interest and merit in the book  itself, which there is not, render it a very cheap purchase.” [133]
                 
43
       
As we can see, the critical reception was far  from entirely negative, although even the favorable critics showed  little knowledge of or interest in art. What made the book, in the words  of Hayley’s sympathetic biographer Morchard Bishop, “a disastrous  failure,” [134] was not the reviewers, but the reading public. Two other works that Hayley said met with “surprising ill success” (Memoirs 2: 74-75) were his four-volume edition of Cowper’s Milton (1810) and his Three Plays  (1811). Recognizing the likelihood that “I have lost my popularity,”  Hayley published no new works after 1811, although he lived until  1820. [135] The  literary euphemisms and affectations that had charmed previous  generations of readers no longer had such an effect. As late as 1803,  Hayley’s biography of Cowper had achieved both critical and commercial  success, but Cowper’s letters had a major role in this, and Romney, as  Bishop observes, was an indifferent letter writer. Romney’s language was  pictorial, and Hayley scarcely did him justice in his selection of both  pictures and engravers. As we have seen, some of his choices appear  arbitrary and even haphazard with respect to both. As for Blake, he had  labored for over two years on behalf of the illustrations to Hayley’s  book only to find himself represented in it by a single engraving.  Ironically, The Life of George Romney, Esq. is valued today chiefly for Blake’s print of The Shipwreck.

21. On 29 Oct. 1797  Joseph Farington was told that “Romney … is a convert from Democracy,  and now says He believes Monarchy is best after all,” which suggests  that he was known for his radical views at least until then. See The Diary of Joseph Farington,  ed. Kenneth Garlick, Angus Macintyre, and Kathryn Cave (New Haven: Yale  University Press, 1978-84) 3: 910. Farington’s informant was the  gem-engraver Nathaniel Marchant, whom Romney had known since his time in  Rome (1773-75).

30. Diary of Joseph Farington 2:  432 (8 Dec. 1795). Farington’s informant was “Mr. Sharpe,” presumably  Romney’s friend the West India merchant Richard (“Conversation”) Sharp.  In the same conversation Farington was told that “Romney did, for many  years, wish for independance; that He might be able to exercise the  powers of his mind in his profession. He still looks forward to a time  when He shall have that indulgence ….”

47. BR(2)  188. It was an uncharacteristic diplomatic blunder for Hayley to say  that he had a claim on six pictures that were in John Romney’s  possession, especially as John, we now know from his Memoirs (124), thought that Hayley had stolen some of his father’s works.
         
48. Hayley refers to his Poetical Epistle to an Eminent Painter (London: T. Payne et al., 1778), which he reprints in the Life. The lines are: 

Round fancy’s circle when thy pencil flies, With what terrific pomp thy spectres rise! What lust of mischief marks thy witch’s form, While on the Lapland rock she swells the storm! (Life 374)

52. The Tragedies of Æschylus,  trans. R. Potter, 2nd ed., vol. 2 (London: W. Strahan and T. Cadell,  1779) 354n. Suzanne E. May suggests that this note was added after  Potter’s book was in proof (“George Romney, Robert Potter, and ‘the  Painter’s Poet,’” Transactions of the Romney Society 7 [2002]:  18). Potter seems to have lost confidence in Romney (and, it appears,  all other artists) by 1788, when he wrote to the poet Edward Jerningham  on 15 June: “I know nothing of Macklin or his Exhibitions, unless you  mean the room of vile pictures from the English Poets near Temple Bar.  The best picture scene in Aeschylus is the Ghost of Darius rising from  his tomb; but the Painter would probably make damn’d work of it”  (Huntington Library Ms. JE 704: 061588).
         
53. Hayley, Life of Romney 224-25. This drawing and its companion, The Ghost of Darius Appearing to Atossa, are in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool.
         
54. “A taste for  Aeschylus was in itself symptomatic of the primitivist currents of the  late eighteenth century,” according to Robert Rosenblum, Transformations in Late Eighteenth Century Art (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1974) 18n50 and 161.

61. John Romney’s hostile attitude toward Hayley is frequently expressed in the Memoirs  of 1830. However, there had been unpleasantness between them as early  as 1799, when the painter’s son demanded that Hayley redeem £1500 worth  of stocks. See Victor Chan, “Pictorial Image and Social Reality: George  Romney’s Late Drawings of John Howard Visiting Prisoners,” diss.,  Stanford University, 1983, 26. I thank Ted Andersson for providing me  with a photocopy of the relevant pages of this dissertation.
         
On 22 Aug. 1803 John Romney wrote to Thomas Greene about the  £15 allowed to Hayley by George Romney’s executors. “Mr. Hayley insults  my father’s memory by saying it is no more than a just return for his  signal services. What signal services? for leading him by his bad  example and evil counsels into those fatal errors which marked with  misfortune and calamity the latter period of his life. Happy would he  have been had he never known Mr. Hayley.” See Hilda Gamlin, George Romney and His Art  (London: Swan Sonnenschein, 1894) 312-14. In 1804 Blake thought that  some misunderstanding between the two had been ironed out, as shown in  his letter to Hayley of 16 Mar. (E 743-44), and John Romney did help  Hayley to the extent of permitting him to reproduce Newton with the Prism and The Shipwreck, and giving him The Shipwreck as a present.
         
62. For details, see Crosby and Essick 61-62.
         
63. See, for  example, Blake’s letter of 23 Feb. 1804 (E 742). A print that is  probably Blake’s frontispiece has been acquired by Robert N. Essick and  will be the subject of a paper by Mark Crosby, forthcoming in this  journal.

This conviction on Blake’s part would have  been intensified if, as Crosby and Essick suggest (71), he saw a  large-paper copy of Hayley’s Life that had printed on its spine “HAYLEY’S / LIFE / OF / ROMNEY / Illustrated / WITH / TWELVE PLATES / BY / CAROLINE WATSON.”

For her part, Emma Hamilton regarded Hayley as a trusted friend:  “If I had never read your Triumphs of temper,” she wrote to him on 29  Jan. 1806, “I shou’d never have been the wife of Sir William Hamilton  not shou’d I have had an opertunity [sic] of Cultivating those talents which made the great and immortal Nelson think me worthy of his Confidence” (English Literature, History, Children’s Books and Illustrations, catalogue of sale at Sotheby’s London, 17 Dec. 2009, lot 10).
         
104. She is mentioned once in Blake’s letters to Hayley: “Tho I have calld on Mr  Edwards twice for Lady Hamiltons direction was so unfortunate as to  find him Out both times I will repeat my Call on him tomorrow morning”  (27 Jan. 1804, E 741). Mr. Edwards was probably Edward Edwards, who in  1808 published Anecdotes of Painters Who Have Resided or Been Born in England.

Steele had studied for a year with Carl van Loo in  Paris, and dressed so fashionably after returning that he was known as  “Count” Steele.

Reviewed by Tristanne Connolly
         
Tristanne Connolly (tristanne.connolly@uwaterloo.ca)  is associate professor in the English Department of St. Jerome’s  University in the University of Waterloo. She is the author of William Blake and the Body (2002), and co-editor of the essay collections Queer Blake (2010) with Helen P. Bruder and Blake 2.0: William Blake in Twentieth-Century Art, Music and Culture (forthcoming) with Steve Clark and Jason Whittaker.

William Blake on Self and Soul discusses  fundamentally interesting topics: Blake’s relation to empiricism and  Gnosticism, and his struggle with existential alienation. But the book  applies a preconceived framework to his poetry, and this has an  unfortunate steamroller effect: it flattens out the texts in its path  and moves straight ahead, passing by much that would be helpful, and  even necessary, to its purpose.

To summarize the framework: “the essential  uneasiness of consciousness” (85) is exacerbated by empiricism, a  “Science [of] Despair” (Milton 41.15, E 142) that renders the  self “intangible” and the world “real” (12). The soul’s intuition of its  “transcendental provenance” (xiii), discounted by empiricism, is  experientially true, for Blake and all human beings. For remedy, Blake  pursues Neoplatonism and Gnosticism, but with a twist, rejecting the  individual immortal soul in favor of “the Human Imagination” and the  afterlife in favor of “the Eternal Now” (21). He describes the problem  in the early illuminated books, then develops his solution, which leads  from personal agency in The Four Zoas to individual reformation in Milton and ultimately to self-sacrifice in Jerusalem.

The emphasis on the value of experience as a  touchstone for theory and interpretation is salutary, but I wish that  Quinney had explored ways to ground this principle methodologically.  Phenomenology would be an obvious resource. Sensibility, with its  connections to empiricism, would make an ideal context for both the  prizing and the suspicion of the inner life and its pains as an index of  authenticity and route to salvation. Biography could be employed to  consider Blake’s own understanding of a basic and universal existential  bewilderment. This last Quinney nods to occasionally; for instance, she  considers Blake’s “indenturing himself to the dreadful poetaster Hayley  of Felpham” as his own “delinquency of Imagination,” making “Blake’s  critique of Milton” also a “cryptic self-reproach” (134). Such a  judgmental view seems unfair to both Hayley and Blake in light of Mark  Crosby’s work [1] and, less recently, the detailed and balanced picture of the relationship in G. E. Bentley, Jr.’s The Stranger from Paradise  (2001) where, though the tensions are evident, “Hayley’s loyalty to  Blake persisted even in the most trying circumstances”—in his financial  and moral support throughout Blake’s prosecution for sedition—“and Blake  continued to serve Hayley energetically long after he had left Hayley’s  direct patronage” (Bentley 234). Looking more closely at the  complexities of the friendship would not only have been more accurate,  but also might have helped to develop a parallel between imagination  under patronage and consciousness under material constraints.

Without an explicit effort to locate the  experience of “the actual subject” as opposed to the fabled unitary one  (2), differentiating between authentic and pernicious representations  becomes arbitrary, or generically prejudiced. Locke “has no theory of  the self and gives no representation of the inner life. But Wordsworth,  who put the empiricist metaphors into play, wrote the autobiography of  Lockean subject [sic] in his poems of the 1790s” (69). When  Wordsworth does it, it is pathos (and even Blake, Quinney argues, is  sympathetic in his critique); when Locke does it, it is not a moving  description of the alienated soul but its cruel condemnation to a “dark  box” (85). Quinney’s brief discussion of Locke’s theory of the self  (which he does indeed have, coining the term “personal identity” in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding)  dwells on the impossibility of complete self-knowledge and sees Locke’s  call for self-examination as self-objectification, rather than a view  of the inner life, or an attempt to let some light into the existential  darkness (44-45). Strangely, she perceives no struggle in Locke:  personal identity is simply “continuity of memory” (169), regardless of  all the puzzles and qualifications that lead him to this position, which  remains problematic in the end (Locke is not only anxious about  forgetfulness, but also remarks that his theory would allow for multiple  persons in one spirit or body, and vice versa; see, for instance,  2.27.22-23). Locke hardly “missed” the “subtlety” (78) that past and  present selves are both linked and alienated.

Even if Quinney sticks to the old Frye line of  Blake against empiricism, she could strengthen her position by arguing  with other scholarship beyond one footnote simply asking the reader to  “compare” with an opposing view from Steve Clark (179). Another footnote  directs the reader to “recent” studies on Wordsworth and empiricism  from 1989 and 1991 (180); there are four pieces of post-2000 Blake  criticism in the bibliography. Reference would be enriching, for  instance, to Matthew Green’s Visionary Materialism in the Early Works of William Blake: The Intersection of Enthusiasm and Empiricism (2005), and, within the bibliography’s time zone, Wayne Glausser’s Locke and Blake: A Conversation across the Eighteenth Century (1998) (which also sees a therapeutic motivation in Blake’s work, and Locke’s). Kevin Hutchings’s Imagining Nature: Blake’s Environmental Poetics  (2002) would be useful at moments like this: “Everyone knows that Blake  is a species of Platonic idealist, championing Imagination over Nature,  and the transcendent realm over the world of matter” (99). Quinney  pronounces Blake “an atheist and an unbeliever” and ironizes any  contrary evidence: “he flaunted his secular religiousness deliberately  by constantly writing of God and Christ” (26). Even Martin Priestman’s Romantic Atheism: Poetry and Freethought, 1780-1830 (1999) does not claim atheism for Blake; his careful examination would be another profitable addition to the works cited.

Tracing Blake’s response to Gnosticism is  challenging because his sources would have been largely secondary:  histories of heresies with an orthodox or unorthodox axe to grind.  Quinney relies on Hans Jonas’s definitive work, but he has the benefit  of material that long postdates Blake, such as the Nag Hammadi library,  unearthed in the mid-twentieth century. Quinney states that she is not  source-hunting; fair enough, but she does not find an alternative way to  maintain precision. She appeals to E. P. Thompson on the “Gnostic  lineage” of “popular religious movements” that influenced Blake, and  declares, “That is good enough for me,” with only a cursory  acknowledgement of the Moravian discoveries which displace Thompson’s  theories (55-56). She goes on to say, “I would simply like to name as  ‘Gnostic’ the kernel of religious humanism in all the religions in which  he participated sympathetically” (56). Clearly, this dilutes “Gnostic”  to near meaninglessness. She does qualify that “religious humanism” here  indicates treating the human as the divine, but the following  paragraphs show how Blake “jettisons Gnosticism’s proliferation of  divine beings including the enigmatic Unknown God” (57): that is, how  Gnosticism fails to treat the human as divine.

Blake’s own mythic beings are interpreted in  anthology footnote style: for instance, Ololon “represents” Milton’s  “Emanation” and also his “actual wives and daughters” (166-67) and is  assumed to be uncomplicatedly female. Yet Quinney’s comparison of  Oothoon to Sophia (46) is a sharp point, and she builds upon it to argue  for a strong role for Emanations: they are the ones who “awak[e] from  the stupor of materialism,” recognize “Eternal Life,” and feel pity for  “the spectrous dead” (93). The “Emanations represent the perception that  their Zoa refuses”; they fulfill a Cassandra-like prophetic function  (106). Though this does not place the Emanations in an enviable  position—portions of other beings, their insights ignored, left to  lament—it does endow them, particularly, with soul-saving perception,  compassion, and resistance. One moment which captures Blake’s own  perceptive sympathy is a consideration of “The Smile” as a microcosm of a  “typically Blakean … movement of affect.” Though it is painting with  too broad a brush to claim that “each of the Epic Prophecies as a whole  moves this way,” the pattern that Quinney describes is evocative: there  is “a gripping … account of suffering,” then “the ray of light, when it  comes, is invested with all the pathos of remission” (88).

It is regrettable that Quinney’s emphasis on  authentic experience of the self leads her away from adequate research  and precise reading, marring the potential to delineate Blake’s  compassion for the wandering soul and stir sympathetic echoes in  readers.

James Rovira.  Blake and Kierkegaard: Creation and Anxiety.  London: Continuum, 2010.  x + 184 pp.  £60.00/$110.00, hardcover; £24.99/$44.95, paperback (2011).

Kathryn Freeman (kfreeman@miami.edu) is associate professor of English at the University of Miami. She is the author of Blake’s Nostos: Fragmentation and Nondualism in The Four Zoas and is currently completing work on her second book, Rendering India: British Women Writers and the Orientalist Transmission of Sanskrit (1785-1835).

                 
1
       
In Blake and Kierkegaard: Creation and Anxiety,  James Rovira explores historical synchronicities to mine the potential  for like-mindedness between Blake and Kierkegaard. He introduces a  compelling rationale for bringing the two writers together: “Neither  author is concerned with history as such but rather with the  phenomenological profile that historical forces hold for the individual  subject” (3). This distinction between “history as such” and the  subject’s intersection with history as a “phenomenological” experience  is an improvement over previous studies of these writers that separate  history and subjectivity.
                 
 
       
2
       
Just as this synthesis of history and  subjectivity offers a rethinking of Blake and of Kierkegaard, Rovira’s  revision of Derridean deconstruction from the hindsight of new  historicism challenges the assumption of mutual exclusion between the  two theoretical positions. More relevant for the study itself, this  strategy has the potential to prevent the argument from being limited to  mere synchronicity. Yet it is more persuasive regarding Kierkegaard  than for Blake: Rovira negotiates the atemporality of deconstruction via  the observation that “Kierkegaardian anxiety is not a textual movement  but an emotional one, an individual experience registered in literature  but embedded within historical, cultural, social, and personal  particularities,” which provides the basis for the study’s focus on  Kierkegaard’s “understand[ing] individuality to exist in a continual  dialectic with history and society” (4). Attributing the same impulse to  Blake’s texts is less convincing, however. Applying deconstruction,  even in tandem with new historicism, in reading Blake’s texts or designs  is problematic for reasons Paul de Man first articulated: Blake’s  “privileging of writing” makes it “less resistant” to deconstruction, a  remark that seems truer to the more complex erasures and re-creations in  Blake’s cosmology; incorporating the historical dimension does not  resolve but rather evades this fundamental problem. [1]

The potential for reductiveness is a danger for  any comparison between writers, but it is more so between a philosopher  and a writer-artist as multifaceted as Blake. By premising the argument  on the assumption that “their works are a record of psychological  development and struggle,” Rovira’s study sacrifices the idiosyncrasies  of Blake’s cosmology, particularly its elasticity, in a rigid paradigm  of abstract categories more suitable for analyzing systematic philosophy  (3). More problematic than the claim that the binaries—science vs.  religion, nature vs. artifice, and democracy vs. monarchy—exist within  texts is Rovira’s assertion that Blake and Kierkegaard represent, if not  precisely two polarities, two sides of the study’s central binary,  “creation and anxiety”: “Blake’s mythology represents the ‘creation’ and  Kierkegaard’s philosophy the ‘anxiety’ of creation anxiety” (2).
                 
 
       
4
       
The organizational choice of shuttling between  the writers via these binaries keeps the argument broad and shallow.  Thus, for instance, the second chapter studies Blake and Kierkegaard  vis-à-vis the Socratic tradition, as “both drew from a centuries-old  classical model of personality,” a broad claim that prevents the  possibility of exploring Blake’s particularly complex relationship not  only to the classical but the neoclassical (36). Rovira asserts that  Blake condemns nature in “A Vision of the Last Judgment” (48), but it is  a text that works against dualities: its concluding remark, “I question  not my Corporeal or Vegetative Eye any more than I would Question a  Window concerning a Sight I look thro it and not with it” (E 566),  subverts Rovira’s implicit binary of commendation vs. condemnation.  Later in the chapter, he offers a far more nuanced reading of Blake’s  “ambivalence toward Plato” that suggests the need not only to revise the  earlier statement, but to consider the deeper implications of  subject-object duality at the heart of the comparison between the two  writers (49). When the study does move away from the “x vs. y” formula,  it makes room for such complexities as the notion of inwardness at the  end of the third chapter.
                 
 
       
5
       
That the book’s breadth jeopardizes depth is a  problem not only based on the multiplicity of binaries, but on the  choice to devote large sections of the study to background information,  much of which could have been relegated to endnotes. Similarly, the  treatment of criticism in some cases is an undigested compilation; at  other times it generalizes about critical approaches based on one or two  studies. Rovira connects creation anxiety to Blake’s concept of  Generation and by extension to gender and sexuality. However, in his  discussion of The Book of Thel and Visions of the Daughters of Albion  he collapses forty years of feminist criticism on Blake to a single  1977 study (75). The treatment of gender and sexuality in these poems  founders still more as Rovira makes “a brief excursion” into “The  Tyger,” a pattern of digression repeated with loosely connected  “excursions” into texts by other authors. At the beginning of chapter 4,  for example, and at several other points, Frankenstein is  brought in to represent narratives of creation anxiety, yet the  discussion is so fleeting that it raises many unaddressed questions  about how creation anxiety in Shelley’s novel compares to that in  Kierkegaard’s philosophical writings or Blake’s poetry and designs.  Since addressing these questions would be tangential to the thesis, a  better choice might have been to relegate such references to endnotes.

Besides the largely unassimilated quarry of  historical information and critical perspectives, and the plethora of  undeveloped topics, a need to control the unwieldiness of the book is  evident even at the level of syntax, as exemplified by the sentence,  “This dichotomy in Blake’s artistic output encouraged in Blake’s mind a  dichotomy between Blake the commercial engraver and Blake the visionary  artist, the former subject to the power of a spectrous fiend while the  latter is emancipated and visionary” (54). In the case of a passage  analyzing the two writers with regard to the classical model of  personality, so many claims are made in a single sentence that few of  them get developed or synthesized with each other: “The process of  innocence collapsing into generation—or in other words, the transition  from the aesthetic to the ethical, from innocence to experience—lays the  groundwork for Blake’s articulation of creation anxiety” (60).

With a shift away from the stark contrasts that  form its skeleton, Rovira’s book offers a fresh possibility of viewing  each writer through the lens of the other in a number of tantalizing  suggestions, such as through the relationship between generation and  creation. Rovira’s observation that the creator figure in Blake’s The Four Zoas is  Enion rather than Urizen, for instance, has intriguing implications for  the earlier section on Thel and Oothoon (113). In this regard, the book  contributes to a rethinking of the boundaries of theory, particularly  as they need to be addressed vis-à-vis the field of European and British  romanticism.

Most of the primary material in William Blake’s Conversations will be familiar to those who have studied Gerald E. Bentley’s two editions of Blake Records, Blake Records Supplement, and his 2001 biography, The Stranger from Paradise,  but the scholarly alchemy effected by distilling reports of Blake’s  spoken words into a compact volume and adding an array of related tools  has created something rich, strange, and likely to prove enduringly  useful. Because many of the reports come to us from within a generation  or two after Blake’s death, they are strongly colored by the late  Georgian/early Victorian conception of him: these Blakeish words often  seem to reflect the minds of the reporters as much as they reveal the  mind of Blake, and as the intervening years and layers of reportage  multiply, the share of credible Blake content diminishes. A snippet of  Blake’s conversation that was worth retelling or recording is likely to  have been one that conformed to, or at least resonated with, the other  stories about Blake in circulation at the time. Gathered together in  largely unmediated form, these reports constitute a portrait of a fellow  we might call Anecdotal Blake, a somewhat different being from the  persona we moderns know through his works in ink and paint, Autographic  Blake. Ironically, Autographic Blake was not very well known to some of  the original constructors of Anecdotal Blake—even to ones who knew Flesh  and Blood Blake himself. Those modern readers who are thoroughly  acquainted with Autographic Blake may find the shimmery Anecdotal Blake  who rises in these pages to be an uncanny and alien creature, but it is  intriguing to hear his voice, and like any chatty ghost he may have  things to tell us beyond the grave.

The book begins with an insightful foreword by  Mary Lynn Johnson, followed by an engaging set of introductory gestures  and prolegomena, most of them a few paragraphs long, by Bentley, then  the collected “conversations” themselves. This is a very mixed bag that  includes any text that plausibly but indirectly records a Blake  statement or something like a Blake statement, even words that he  probably did not say, such as the seditious utterings reported in the  testimony of the soldier who invaded Blake’s garden in Felpham.  Presumably the rationale for including this report is that the  confrontation definitely did occur and all agree that Blake said  something. By contrast, the famous story of naked Blake saying, “Come  in, it’s only Adam and Eve, you know!” to Thomas Butts in the  summer-house is not here (except at least two mentions as an example of  what did not make the cut). Though it is only a little less likely on  its face than many of the other anecdotes from the same period, the Adam  and Eve story is probably apocryphal from top to bottom, and its  omission is well deserved. Yet Bentley casts the net for Blakean  “conversations” very broadly, including, for instance, at least one  unspoken report of a vision reportedly found in a lost letter from Blake  to Butts (see below), a fictive conversation between a Blakean persona  and Isaiah and Ezekiel from The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (10), and an assertion that Blake’s wife said she didn’t know what Blake meant by The Book of Urizen  (13). The entries are arranged in rough chronological order, when  possible by year of purported utterance, extending from a retrospective  account of Blake’s telling his mother of angels on Peckham Rye in 1767,  to 1831, with the last imagined echoes of Blake’s voice, audible at most  to Catherine on her deathbed, as she called out “continually to her  William, as if he were only in the next room” (81). They are minimally  annotated as to source, but most are not otherwise contextualized or  qualified. Bentley’s commodious criteria make sense: why omit a  potentially illuminating bit of second-order information merely because  it was not really a conversation, or because it didn’t actually involve  Blake’s saying anything (as in the Urizen story above, which usefully indicates that Blake didn’t  talk to Catherine about what some of his works meant), and why clutter  the book with inevitably inconclusive assessments of the veracity of the  reports?

Bentley’s broad definition of “conversation” has  payoffs: if he had been more exclusionary he might, for instance, have  omitted the anecdote reported at second or third hand by Oswald Crawfurd  about a vision Blake supposedly had (and supposedly “afterwards  records” somewhere) during his apprenticeship at Basire’s, “when he was  one day … secluded in … Westminster Abbey.” Crawfurd says that Blake  reported (apparently in a lost letter to Butts, not in an actual  conversation) that he saw “one of his visions”: “the aisles and  galleries of the old building (or sanctuary) suddenly filled with a  great procession of monks and priests, choristers and censer-bearers”  (3). This sounds at first like one more of those early accounts that  focus on Blake as a man who saw spirits, and the language is utterly  unlike Blake’s, so one might discount it. But in this case there may be a  nonverbal echo of such a vision “afterwards record[ed]” by Blake in  later life, though it is unlikely that Crawfurd would have known about  it. Among the recently discovered designs to Blair’s Grave is  an unengraved picture that Flaxman called “The Gambols of Ghosts  according with their affections previous to the final Judgment,”  representing the nocturnal activities of phantoms in a churchyard.  Blake’s scene elaborates upon a passage early in Blair’s poem that  describes “light-heeled ghosts and visionary shades” that “perform their  mystic rounds” around a “trusty yew” beneath “the wan cold moon.” The  rediscovered watercolor design (which is clearly developed from a sketch  that is now in the Yale Center for British Art) shows a churchyard  occupied by three distinct classes of ghosts performing their “rounds”  in their own ways: six “light-heeled” dancers circling the yew, another  larger circle of violent quarrelers, victims, and victimizers, and an  orderly right-to-left procession of the host composed of pious  “visionary shades” bearing tapers, huge tomes, and bread and wine into  the church. Blake’s decision to expand the population of Blair’s  churchyard in this particular way may have been inspired in part by a  thirty-year-old vision of a ghostly parade in Westminster Abbey.

In addition to the snippets of conversation  themselves, Bentley includes several conversation-related scholarly  tools. The most useful is probably the concordance of the words used in  the reported conversations, but interesting as well are the speculative  remarks in the introduction on Blake’s pronunciation and the  implications of rhymes (xxi-xxxv) and the supporting tables of perfect  and imperfect rhymes in the appendices. Throughout the volume Bentley  maintains a much lighter scholarly demeanor than one might expect from  the author of those magisterial classics, Blake Books and Blake Records—this  assemblage is hosted by Conversational Bentley, a manifestation of the  generous and genial Flesh and Blood Bentley that the lucky may meet in  person. This Bentley is much too polite and good-natured to acknowledge,  say, that a plausible thirdhand anecdote might be unreliable—all tales  are treasured here, and accorded pretty much the same respect as an  entertaining raconteur at dinner. Similarly, the evidence to be found in  Blake’s rhymes about the way he probably pronounced words is  fascinating but so oblique that it would be difficult to use without  extensive qualification. Though there is a danger that some will treat  this whole judicious assemblage of somewhat problematic facts as having  the same kind of authority as Blake’s own words, the lightheartedly  learned tone that prevails should inhibit anyone from taking it all too  literally.

Wayne C. Ripley and Justin Van Kleeck, eds.  Editing and Reading Blake.  Romantic Circles Praxis Volume.  September 2010.  http://www.rc.umd.edu/praxis/editing_blake/index.html.
         
Reviewed by Nelson Hilton
         
Nelson Hilton (nhilton@uga.edu)  co-founded (with Paul Mann and Thomas A. Vogler) the Santa Cruz Blake  Study Group; his “Golgonooza Text” appears in the Romantic Circles  Praxis volume Digital Designs on Blake http://www.rc.umd.edu/praxis/designsonblake/hilton/hilton.html.

I remember being introduced to a senior scholar  at a summer Huntington Library lawn party a generation ago and his  inquiring politely, “Well, what’s your angle?” Stephen Dedalus’s inner  panic to “say something” flashed to Steelyard the Lawgiver’s Island in the Moon  reassurance that “every person has a something” as I fumbled to come up  with a dissertation abstract. Those more than thirty years past rise  again in contemplating the analogous age differences between the two  sets of contributors to this Romantic Circles electronic  collection, which presents the efforts of four “younger Blake editors  and scholars” and three “established” ones. The latter, Mary Lynn  Johnson, W. H. Stevenson, and David Fuller, are doubtless familiar to  subscribers of this journal for their three different “successful print  editions” of “texts designed to appeal to first-time readers of Blake,”  while the former, Rachel Lee, J. Alexandra McGhee, and co-editors Wayne  C. Ripley and Justin Van Kleeck, “have all worked as project assistants  to the Blake Archive and received their graduate training from  its editors” (introduction, par. 4; Johnson, par. 2). With the concise  print elders accounting for less than a third of the volume (in my  printout, anyway, and not counting the errata sheet for Johnson and  Grant’s second edition, for which there is no editorially supplied print  option), and the organizers’ point taken that “Stevenson, Johnson, and  Fuller all see their editions being used in connection with the Blake Archive”  (introduction, par. 7), the juxtaposition carries the sense of staged  generational baton-passing to celebrate the expanding empire of the Blake Archive.
                 
2
       
There is also a curious sense that the senior  three serve as a stalking-horse for the dismissal of “immersive  textuality.” The introduction, by Ripley, notes that the collection  (generally referred to as just “Editing Blake”) might in some respects be seen as a companion to Ron Broglio’s effort in the same series five years previous, Digital Designs on Blake. But, he notes, “instead of employing the model of the archive common to electronic editions like the Blake Archive,  Broglio offers ‘immersive textuality’ as a model for engaging literary  works from within” (par. 5). Arguing that “most of the electronic  heuristics explored by Digital Designs have had a very brief shelf life and limited popular appeal” and that “print media and the self-declared ‘conservative’ Blake Archive  are the primary means by which almost all of Blake’s readers engage his  works” (par. 5), the introduction returns in its concluding paragraph  to “Stevenson, Johnson, and Fuller, whose integration of the general  reader into their editorial vision should be the model for any future  uses of immersive textuality in approaching Blake” (par. 35).

As for the “angles” and “something” of the new  age, these appear to include “remediation,” “editioning,” and  “delineation editing.” By far the most common is “remediation,” imported  from Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin’s 1999 book of that title and  used to denote the changes in form, content, circulation, and meaning  that accompany the translation of a work from one medium to another. The  introduction, for instance, finds it “noteworthy” that the Blake Digital Text Project [BDTP] “made digitizing Erdman’s Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake  an early priority, presumably for the purpose of improving the text  through [its] remediation” (par. 7). What was posted in 1997 for the  purpose of convenience was the source text for the project’s  concordance—complete with the rather obviously added identification of  each line and page for the primitive search program—and this is  described, dramatically and anachronistically, as being “silent in how  [its] remediation altered” the Erdman text, with a screen shot to  illustrate. These obvious changes in the BDTP version, plus others introduced in the Blake Archive  instance of that source text, lead to the portentous suggestion that  “although neither copy is a new edition, these significant differences  mean that the standard edition of Blake now exists in three versions. Do  these variations call into question the authority of the letterpress  edition itself, and inasmuch as they mirror the variations found in the  original prints, do they direct readers to print and digital facsimiles?  Or will a reader simply take the digitization at face value …?” (par.  8). To recycle the words of the Santa Cruz Blake Study Group,  twenty-eight years back, “would it be such apostasy to say that none of this matters …?” (Blake 18.1 [summer 1984]: 14). Nothing escapes remediation, it appears, but while “the exceptional influence of the [Blake] Archive  demands a detailed understanding of how it remediates Blake” (par. 22),  we are told at the same time of a print edition that “remedies [its]  remediation by referring readers to the Princeton-Blake Trust Series and  the Blake Archive” (par. 31).

Proposer and co-editor of the collection, Justin  Van Kleeck foregrounds his angle with the first word of his prolix  contribution, “Editioning William Blake’s VALA/The Four Zoas.”  While editing “represents a unique act of ‘interpretation,’” in his  account, “so, too, does what I call ‘editioning,’ or the process of  turning some original work into a distinct object and work” through  editing it in an edition (par. 3). An edition (or “editioning”) “then,  is an interpretation-in-print, not to mention a critical argument about  how Blake can (and should?) be edited” (par. 47). While we hear little  of the actual interpretations inhering in its editions, we are assured  that although “Blake’s restless manuscript” is “safely stowed away in a  British Library safe,” “ambiguity abounds in the VALA/Four Zoas manuscript resting peacefully in a library safe” (pars. 9, 18, 19).
                 
5
       
According to his co-editor Ripley, Van Kleeck  surveys the editionings of “Keynes, Margoliouth, Erdman, Bentley, and  Stevenson in masterful detail, providing a valuable and lasting  contribution to the editorial history of the work” (introduction, par.  24). For this reader, though, what abides is the focus on the “highly  fragile and highly valuable manuscript as a ‘Z-Safe Restricted’  work—which, translated from the argot, means that it stays in  the safe almost without exception” (Van Kleeck, par. 80). Fortunately  for his essay, with the help of a recommendation that “literally  ‘cracked the safe’” for him, Van Kleeck had “the truly unique chance” to  study the manuscript and “engage it in brief Intellectual Battle” (note  36; par. 82). The experience left him with “newfound respect” for those  editors who “tried their best to represent it in some way,” the  realization of “just how inadequate any edition would be” (par. 82), and  regret “that many scholars, and even general readers, likely will never  get to see the stunning, intimidating, and tantalizing work” (par. 83).  Returning from his battle he “repaid” his recommender “with a two-day  crash course on the manuscript, which I believe still has him woozy”  (note 36). If this writing is a sample, he may be right. In any event,  considerations of article editing aside, it is good to know that the Blake Archive editioning of VALA/The Four Zoas  is proceeding, and that “along with the fresh transcriptions will be  fresh (and I must say spectacular) full-color digital images at  unprecedented 300 dpi resolution” (par. 65).
                 
6
       
Wayne C. Ripley’s unillustrated “Delineation  Editing of Co-Texts: William Blake’s Illustrations” identifies its  subject as “a specifically Blakean notion of social-text editing” (par.  7). Ripley is concerned with Blake’s many illustrations to the works of  others and through delineation editing seeks “to expand the editorial  frame beyond the illustrations themselves to encompass their material  and social realities” (par. 7). His strong argument is that the “source  texts” for the illustrations “be considered ‘co-texts’” that “function  in their own socio-historical network” (par. 11) and deserve full  representation in the Blake Archive that at present “excludes  much, if not all, of the original works that spurred the illustrations,  omits the physical context in which the design exists, and leaves out  paratextual features such as prefaces, epigraphs, and even blank leaves  that Blake may have considered as part of the field for constructing his  meaning” (par. 12).
                 
7
       
In “‘The productions of time’: Visions of Blake  in the Digital Age,” Rachel Lee and J. Alexandra McGhee relate their  “experiences editing Blake’s manuscript, An Island in the Moon” for the Blake Archive  (par. 7). While “forthcoming” at the time of their publication, its  availability online was announced just in time for me to check whether  Steelyard the Lawgiver’s assurance recalled above was that “every body”  or “every person has a something.” It was “person,” but, to my surprise,  here he or she has not “a something” but “as something.” And the 300  dpi enlargement certainly depicts what looks like a cursive “a” with a  cursive “s” attached, with an editorial note in the transcription  (object 8, line 12) asserting that “the last word of the line is ‘as’,  though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman (page 456) read ‘a’ without comment.” (While the authors state that “the Archive  includes variant readings from Phillips, G. E. Bentley, and David  Erdman within text notes” [note 12] and offer a detailed example of  another transcription by Michael Phillips in note 11, his reading of “a  something” goes unmentioned in the Blake Archive textual note.  That any such omission is not an oversight of Lee and McGhee is made  clear by the archive’s “Electronic Edition Information” “Statement of  Responsibility,” which identifies as editors of the manuscript only  Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi.)
                 
8
       
Lee and McGhee do offer the collection’s only  direct encounter with the current framework for electronic editing,  eXtensible Markup Language or XML. An XML document consists of two  parts, the document type definition or DTD that defines the mark-up tags  to be used and their hierarchical order, and the tagged or marked-up  content. The tag set is thus crucial, as it establishes the parameters  of what can be marked up and processed for particular display (using a  style-sheet language, XSL, and program, XSLT, which can transform the  XML markup into widely varying formats). Unfortunately, while the  authors direct us to “see ‘Manuscript Tag Set’” (par. 19), it is nowhere  on offer, though it would appear that it “integrat[es]” at least some  of the current Text Encoding Initiative guidelines (par. 28). Other of  their references, to “Filling out an XML BAD File” (par. 19), for  example (BAD here is evidently an acronym for Blake Archive  Description), appear to invoke inaccessible private sites.
                 
9
       
Repeated claims for the importance of  transparency (e.g., pars. 32, 33, 45) notwithstanding, the source code  or markup version of the transcription does not appear to be available  to readers of the Blake Archive, so it is impossible to  consider fully the claim that “XML is a better archiving and editing  tool” or that “previously published works in the Blake Archive …  will benefit from the updated tag set” (pars. 15, 20). For example, the  authors state that their “decisions about how to encode … sections of  backwards text in Island can be retroactively applied to the  Illuminated Books that also contain mirror writing” (note 6). The  transcription of the reversed text in object 18, line 10, however, is  perfectly straightforward, with only a textual note to explain that “the  letters ‘Bl’ (followed by an uncertain letter ‘a’) are written in  backwards lettering.” Updated encoding that serves to trigger a textual  note is surely an improvement over no notice at all. Also on the same  object, readers will note the transcription in line 8 which reads, in  its entirety, “Lamb [b in gray font] n [in blue font] n █”.  Setting aside accessibility concerns as to how sight-impaired readers  will know, for instance, that gray font denotes “unclear or conjectural  text,” it would be an interesting exercise for the reader to link to  object 18 and find “Lamb” in short order (hint: the “L” of “Lamb” is  below the initial stroke of the “n” and the word as a whole underneath  that letter at about one-fifth its size) and to decide whether the  transcription honors “the Archive’s concern with Blake’s revisions and the physicality of the page” (par. 22).
                 
10
       
In their concluding paragraphs, Lee and McGhee  note that “increasingly, visions of future electronic editions put more  of the editorial process in the hands of the reader.” They cite Peter  Robinson’s conception of “‘fluid, co-operative and distributed  editions’” as a “model of scholarly edition which opens itself to  readerly interrogation and intervention” (par. 43). But the prospect is  no sooner offered than replaced with Thomas Tanselle’s writing in 1996  to maintain “the necessity of historical expertise and the vital role  specialists play in interpreting textual artifacts of the past.” After  all, they finish with Tanselle, readers “do retain the power of choosing  how much of the critical apparatus and scholarly research to  incorporate into their reading” (par. 44). (So much for the imposition  of “editioning”!)
                 
11
       
Attempting to split the difference between  Robinson and Tanselle, Lee and McGhee conclude that “regardless of  whether readers actually encode and edit electronic editions, the future  of scholarly digital projects still rests with its [sic] readers” (par. 45). But given that “the Blake Archive’s  primary purpose is for studying Blake rather than reading him” and that  its “primary audience is a scholarly one” (note 8), one senses the  predicament concerning audience underlying their disclosure that  “uncertainty about the long-term future of the Blake Archive … motivates our goals and decisions today …” (par. 46).
                 
12
       
Turning to the print editors, less needs to be  said. In the collection’s shortest piece, “The Ends of Editing,” W. H.  Stevenson writes that “the first duty of an editor is to present an  accurate and useful text” (par. 5). But, as a “modernizing” editor, he  argues that “from time to time” and “in pursuit of clarity and ease of  understanding,” an editor “has to take minor liberties with the minutiae  of Blake’s text” (par. 19). The “only justification” for such tampering  is that “to do so brings us nearer to Blake” (par. 26). Most modern  readers, however, will probably agree with the introduction’s  characterization of Stevenson’s (and Fuller’s) changing of “The Tyger”  to “The Tiger” as “wince-inducing” (introduction, par. 30). Evoking the  characterization of Autolycus in The Winter’s Tale as “a  snapper-up of unconsidered trifles,” Stevenson offers the memorable  observation that “Blake’s Autolycus mind snapped up all manner of  fascinating wayside material in any kind of order” (par. 34).
                 
13
       
David Fuller, in “Modernizing Blake’s Text:  Syntax, Rhythm, Rhetoric,” draws very extensively and apparently without  notice from the introduction to his 2000 William Blake: Selected Poetry and Prose  (reprinted by Pearson Longman in 2008; see pp. 18-26 in either). The  final eight paragraphs turn to a different kind of re-writing (“my  re-writings here” [par. 23]) that re-spaces Blake’s lines “to reveal  features of the rhetorical structure of Blake’s poetry that are  concealed by the conventions of its formal structure” (par. 23).
                 
14
       
Mary Lynn Johnson’s entertaining “Contingencies,  Exigencies, and Editorial Praxis: The Case of the 2008 Norton Blake”  offers an “anecdotal case history” of the “fortuities and mundanities”  leading up to the second edition—after twenty-nine years—of the Norton  Critical Edition she published with “co-editor John E. Grant (husband  Jack)” (pars. 3, 1). In this behind-the-scenes report, we see her  “proclaim by e-mail, a little pompously,” “wail” to her editor, and  “wheedle sympathy” (pars. 4, 12, 13) in the “nitty-gritty trade-offs and  editorial histrionics” (par. 23) that make up the long back-story of  getting the book to press. In keeping with every other contributor, she  does not provide data on actual number of copies printed or sold (or  site hits), but she does candidly offer specifics on the permissions  budget and other constraints. Anyone who uses the new Norton will find  the account rewarding, just as readers of Fuller’s and Stevenson’s  editions, or users of the Blake Archive, will gain from the  inside stories of these respective versions of Blake, forgiving what  they do not approve and loving all for such energetic exertion of  talent.

With Blake and Conflict Palgrave  Macmillan extends its role as the academic press now most consistently  showcasing new Blake scholarship. The volume presents selected revised  papers from a conference of the same title held in Oxford in 2006.  Although it does not entirely surmount the miscellaneous quality that  most conference anthologies have, synergies among several contributions  provide a fairly strong thematic coherence.

Sarah Haggarty and Jon Mee’s introduction  outlines two kinds of conflict as salient for the volume, both involving  the conversation of “Visionary forms dramatic” that Blake envisions in  humanity’s future (Jerusalem 98, E 257). The first centers on  ideological or intellectual conflict as an aspect of pluralistic  harmony: Blake, the editors say, imagines “the kind of community that  arises from the communication between differences” (4). A second, more  mundane, type of conflict involves Blake’s contentious “relationships  with his precursors and precursor texts,” and these too, for the  editors, are relationships among “Contraries,” so that conflict emerges  as a “risk inherent in fully engaging with the other” (4, 5). This  breakdown, however, only partly accounts for the volume’s contents; more  than half the essays involve “conflict” with recent views of Blake or  Blake-like ideas as complicit with imperialism and its ideological  categories, with elite political domination, or with masculinist gender  conceptions. These essays suggest a turn away from a “complicit” Blake  by at least some now working in the field.

Blake’s involvement with burgeoning nationalist  or imperialist ideas has been argued by several recent interpreters,  including Julia M. Wright (Blake, Nationalism, and the Politics of Alienation, 2004), Edward Larrissy (“Blake’s Orient,” Romanticism, 2005), and Steve Clark (“Jerusalem as Imperial Prophecy,” Blake, Nation and Empire,  ed. Clark and Worrall, 2006). The first two essays in the present  volume, by Saree Makdisi and Angus Whitehead, address Larrissy’s  arguments, which themselves critiqued Makdisi’s earlier work. Larrissy  argued, among other points, that Blake’s reference to the Qur’an as a  “loose Bible” in The Song of Los (3.29, E 67) incorporates orientalist notions of Islamic licentiousness and that the Descriptive Catalogue’s  discussion of art in “the ancient republics, monarchies, and  patriarchates of Asia” (E 531) typifies Blake’s limited and eurocentric  knowledge of the East. Makdisi counters that Blake refused orientalism’s  elevation of assumed Western self-control over Eastern license and that  his references to Asian art, if inexact, evince a plural conception of  Europe’s cultural heritage (14-16, 23-24). More broadly, he uses G. A.  Rosso’s “The Religion of Empire: Blake’s Rahab in Its Biblical Contexts”  (Prophetic Character, ed. Gourlay, 2002) as a springboard to  argue that Blake’s late work remains oppositional toward empire (20-21,  25). Though perhaps overly defensive in trying to clear Blake of any  involvement in orientalism, Makdisi is right in my view to insist that  Blake’s thrust is against both the structures of empire and the  psychic-moral formations that bolster them.

Whitehead’s “‘A wise tale of the Mahometans’:  Blake and Islam, 1819–26” uses three specifics—Blake’s reference to a  “wise tale of the Mahometans” in conversation with Crabb Robinson, his  “Visionary Head” of “Mahomet,” and his illustration to the Muhammad–Ali  meeting in Inferno canto 28—as evidence that Blake shows “a  positive engagement with Islam” in a period when “this religious faith  was still regarded by many in Britain as ‘the Devil’s Methodism’” (32,  quoting an 1828 magazine reference). Whitehead, like Makdisi, positions  his essay as a response to Larrissy’s (29-30). Despite some questionable  interpretations, the overall point that these late portrayals avoid any  sort of denigration of Islam both extends Makdisi’s argument and  provides independently valuable insight into Blake’s religious  latitudinarianism.

In “Blake, the Female Prophet and the American  Agent: The Evidence of the 1789 Swedenborg Conference Attendance List,”  David Worrall takes up the issue of complicity with emerging imperialism  in one of Blake’s milieus. His stated purpose is archival, to identify  as many as possible of the conference participants (48), and his modest  conclusion is that contacts with some of them may have influenced  Blake’s later choices of topics and approaches (61). For example,  meeting Dorothy Gott, the prophet of Worrall’s title, could have spurred  Blake’s adoption of prophetic speech modes. Implicitly, Worrall is also  working to rescue the relative social radicalism of central  Swedenborgian figures from views that associate them with commercial  penetration in Africa and land speculation in the United States, as  argued by Deirdre Coleman (see Worrall’s note 18). He does this by  distinguishing some participants who played such a role, such as the  partners in US land dealings Colborn Barrell and Henry Servanté, from  the leading Swedenborgians Carl Wadström and Augustus Nordenskjöld, who  Worrall feels had more disinterested religious motives (52-57).  Particularly valuable is Worrall’s recognition of the autonomy of  religious motivation, its nonreducibility to material interests, and the  consequent pluralism within dissenting traditions, a point relevant to  Blake, who, Worrall speculates, could have known of the Moravians’ work  on the US frontier “with the native North Americans imminently  threatened by Barrell and Servanté” (60).

This pluralism is Mee’s topic in “‘A Little Less  Conversation, A Little More Action’: Mutuality, Converse and Mental  Fight,” which responds to criticisms by David Simpson of “conversation”  as a model for social change (126). Simpson doesn’t discuss Blake, but  Mee takes on his ideas by using Blake to exemplify a different idea of  “conversation” from Simpson’s. Mee distinguishes between relatively  distinct “conversations” in the 1780s and 90s, a polite kind that the  salons of the Mathew circle may have typified, and one stressing  “candour” over politeness, favored by Mary Hays, Godwin, and others  sharing a “tradition of Dissent apt to think ‘collision’ and conflict as  part of any genuine conversational encounter” (127). Mee thinks that  this idea lies behind Blake’s “Visionary forms dramatic” passage and  that Blake “radicalizes the polite vision of conversation” to produce a  “more conflictual model” in tune with radical ideas of change (127,  139).

Mee’s emphasis is not new for him—he has been excavating radical, plebeian forms of conversation since his first book, Dangerous Enthusiasm (1992). His polemical purpose here becomes clearer when one looks at the Simpson essays in Raritan and New Left Review  that he criticizes. Simpson’s idea is that polite models of  conversation play into the hands of elites who decide what is acceptable  subject matter. But additionally, I suspect Mee is reacting to  implications in some Marxist and post-Marxist political writing that  downplay the need for open political debate as part of radical culture.  Simpson, for example, deprecates a current idea of conversation as  “open, undecided, welcoming, antifoundational, and minimally  teleological” (“The Cult of ‘Conversation,’” Raritan, 1997).  This implies preference for discourse that is decided, foundational,  teleological, and so on, terms that tend to exclude free-ranging debate.  Marxism classically, and to some extent still, assumes that  oppositional consciousness derives univocally from its own assumedly  scientific method and that all views except its own ultimately represent  the ideas of opposing classes. (For a classic statement, see the essays  in Georg Lukács’s 1923 History and Class Consciousness.) This  is an issue of course with resonance in the history of twentieth-century  totalitarianism. It is one, too, with relevance for Blake, since some  interpreters, such as Makdisi in his “Blake and the Communist Tradition”  (Palgrave Advances in William Blake Studies, ed. Williams,  2006), have argued for Blake’s continuity with Marxism. Reviewing that  volume in these pages, Jason Whittaker argued that “alternative  traditions of later communist thinking … espoused a view of  anti-authoritarian communism that often appears closer to Blake than  Marxism does” (Blake 44.2 [fall 2010]: 74), and I urged a similar view in my own The Chained Boy: Orc and Blake’s Idea of Revolution  (1999). Mee’s historicizing of “conversation” as including vigorous  debate and ideological confrontation seems, implicitly, also to argue  for the multivoiced character of radical opposition and for placing  Blake, as Whittaker does, in a more open tradition than that of Marxism.

Besides these discussions of overall social  ideology, essays by Susan Matthews and David Fallon target Anne Mellor  and others who assert Blake’s entrapment in and replication of dominant  gender paradigms. Matthews’s “Impurity of Diction: The ‘Harlots Curse’  and Dirty Words,” while accepting that Blake cannot totally escape these  paradigms, argues for the “transformative power” of his writing in  “London,” based “not on the ability of poetry to cleanse but to bring to  the surface and to refigure meanings” (66). Detailing  eighteenth-century debates about prostitution, Matthews urges that the  poem critiques “the evangelical account of prostitution” and prefigures  later Blake works that present women’s sexuality as socially  transformative (74, 79-80). Fallon’s “‘She Cuts his Heart Out at his  Side’: Blake, Christianity and Political Virtue” examines Blake’s  relation to the “civic humanism” tradition, arguing that he gradually  reworks its “republican masculinism.” Fallon’s key texts, “The Mental  Traveller,” the annotations to Bacon, and “I Saw a Monk of Charlemaine,”  persuade him that for later Blake, “male-oriented classical civic  virtue is seriously flawed,” especially by militarism, and “women [are]  essential to a liberatory renewal of the social body” (101).

Rather than critical conflicts about  Blake, Sarah Haggarty, Sibylle Erle, Mark Crosby, Luisa Calè, and Morton  D. Paley all pursue Blake’s own conflicts and alignments with  contemporaries. Haggarty’s “From Donation to Demand? Almsgiving and the  ‘Annotations to Thornton’” and Erle’s “Shadows in the Cave: Refocusing  Vision in Blake’s Creation Myth” focus respectively on Blake’s indignant  response to Robert Thornton’s 1827 version of the Lord’s Prayer and on The Book of Urizen’s  use of eighteenth-century optics and ophthalmology. Haggarty valuably  contextualizes Thornton’s work among contemporary writings on charity  and suggests that by insisting that bread is ours by right, Blake in old  age sustains the radicalism of his youth (107). Erle reads the creation  of the senses in Urizen as influenced by then-current optic theory, including findings on the lens’s active role in vision. Her further argument that Urizen counters Swedenborg’s account of distinct spiritual and material realms by “adapt[ing] optic theory to explain the visible  existence of the spiritual world” (152) is weakened by failure to  discuss the Eternals’ “tent” erected to block vision between these  realms (Urizen 19.2-20.2, E 78-80). Nonetheless, this essay  resituates Blake in a way that counters still-resonant ideas of his  opposition to science.

Crosby, Calè, and Paley focus closely on Blake  and art. In “A Minute Skirmish: Blake, Hayley and the Art of Miniature  Painting,” Crosby examines Blake’s use of stippling in miniatures done  for Hayley, arguing that these works violate models that Hayley  recommended and so are a first step in Blake’s rejection of his patron.  Calè’s “Blake and the Literary Galleries” seeks parallels between Urizen and Night Thoughts and Fuseli’s Milton illustrations, notably Satan Bursts from Chaos. Calè does demonstrate parallels (most convincingly with Urizen),  but her larger argument that both Blake works show the sequential  indeterminacy associated with gallery browsing is overstated. Paley’s  “Blake’s Poems on Art and Artists,” which ends the volume, opens new  ground, given the lack of much previous analysis of these angry Notebook  poems (“To Venetian Artists,” “Florentine Ingratitude,” and others).  Paley proposes that the Orléans sale of French, Italian, and Spanish art  in 1798 was “a major impetus” for the poems (210); he doesn’t provide  evidence but expertly decodes the works and shows their relevance to  Blake’s annotations of Reynolds, long accepted as major statements of  his ideas on art.

One relevant sense of conflict not addressed in  the volume, curiously, is Blake’s representations of social conflicts,  whether the European war—highlighted in the editors’ first sentence but  not discussed by any contributor—or the war at home. Issues still  needing discussion, in my view, include Blake’s possible sanctioning of  social violence in both early and later work (Europe 15, Milton 42), his attention to poverty and growing rebellion during the Regency (Milton 18, Jerusalem 60),  and his sense that social war trumps international war—“The Wine-press  on the Rhine groans loud, but all its central beams / Act more terrific  in the central Cities of the Nations / Where Human Thought is crushd  beneath the iron hand of Power” (Milton 25.3-5, E 121). But one  essay collection can’t do everything, and this one does a great deal  both to extend knowledge of Blake’s intellectual and historical contexts  and, in the polemical essays, to sustain an ongoing debate over his  complicity with or defiance of ideologies of oppression.

Molly Anne Rothenberg (mollyr@tulane.edu) is professor of English and chair at Tulane University. She has published a number of articles on Blake, and her book Re-Thinking Blake’s Textuality explores Blake’s narrative strategies in Jerusalem. Her recent work includes The Excessive Subject: A New Theory of Social Change and a co-edited volume on Zizek (forthcoming).

Whether you are a first-time reader who has opened Jerusalem  intrigued by its design and visionary promise only to close it in  bafflement, or you are an expert Blake scholar, you owe it to yourself  to read this book. Yoder begins by identifying a dominant trend in  studies of the poem since Paley’s monumental The Continuing City: he argues that the majority of the poem’s explicators have come to the conclusion that Jerusalem has  no overarching narrative structure. In his book, he demonstrates  precisely how the poem’s narrative has been neglected or trivialized and  what the crucial consequences of taking the narrative into account  would be.

The book has four main chapters. In his  introduction and in the first chapter, Yoder reviews the evidence for  the non-narrative or “synchrony” argument and traces the history of that  scholarship. A large section of this chapter attends closely to De  Luca’s characterization of the poem as a “wall of words” that provokes  the reader to experience the sublime. Yoder provides abundant  counterevidence to De Luca’s assertions. For example, De Luca bases his  notion of the “wall of words” on the “notorious” (De Luca’s term) plate  16, 
crammed as it is with sixty-nine lines of verse that run  virtually from one edge of the copperplate to the other …. The text  presents itself, in short, as a solid wall of words over which the eye  slips, unable to find fastening. A second glance discriminates bristling  ranks of capital letters, verse without syntax, nouns without  predication, names without context. (De Luca, “A Wall of Words” 232,  qtd. in Yoder 39)
 Yoder points out, however, that this plate forms the conclusion to the  five plates describing the building of Golgonooza, beginning with 12.25,  and that the action of the plate is the “uniting of biblical and  British geography by means of the labors of Los and his workers” (41).  Granting that lines like “Levi. Middlesex Kent Surrey. Judah Somerset  Glouster Wiltshire. / Dan. Cornwal Devon Dorset, Napthali, Warwick  Leicester Worcester” (16.45-46) may look as though they are  asyntactical, Yoder reminds us that the two preceding lines provide the  context and the missing syntactical elements: “And the Forty Counties of  England are thus divided in the Gates / Of Reuben Norfolk, Suffolk,  Essex. Simeon Lincoln, York Lancashire”. (This Blakean tactic of  providing the syntax and context of difficult lines elsewhere in the  poem should be familiar to any reader of “London,” which gives the  second-person command “HEAR” in the initial letters of the first word of  each line in the third stanza to complete its syntax.) He analyzes all  of the plates that might count as “walls of words,” thirty in all, to  argue against De Luca and then focuses on the first, plate 10, which  looks even denser than plate 16, to show that the meanings of individual  words—which De Luca believes to be of little importance—have  extraordinary significance: this is the plate in which appears one of  Blake’s most famous lines, Los’s statement that “I must Create a System,  or be enslav’d by another Mans” (10.20). As Yoder says, “if the poem is  read as de Luca suggests, it is small wonder that it appears to have no  narrative” (45).

As he makes his case for a narrative approach,  Yoder fully acknowledges the impediments to discerning the narrative,  but then goes on to show that those impediments are deliberate and  functional. The conclusion of the first chapter makes the useful point  that all texts force readers to become active to some degree. Yoder  takes his cue from Richard Lanham and Julia Wright to articulate the  ways in which Blake’s unusually opaque style demands that readers  oscillate between looking at the style and looking through  the style. Yoder thinks that De Luca is so captivated by the style that  he cannot see through it to the narrative it traces. By contrast, we  should read both with our “Intellectual Powers” and our “Corporeal  Understanding.”

The second chapter begins the work of tracing the  narrative itself. Criticizing De Luca’s claim that the poem’s sequences  have “no necessary order,” Yoder also argues against the prevailing  opinion that the characters in the poem are simply mouthpieces for ideas  rather than players in a drama or story (De Luca, Words of Eternity  138, qtd. in Yoder 55). The static structure posited by the adherents  of synchrony leads to this mischaracterization. By analyzing scene  sequences in terms of the characters who interact within them, he  identifies four “basic threads” of narrative associated with a main  actor: Albion, Los, the narrator, and characters from the “anterior  myth” (Paley’s phrase) presented in The Four Zoas (57). For Yoder, the most important story concerns Albion, Jerusalem, Albion’s Spectre, and Vala. Although the poem begins in medias res,  it tells the story of Albion’s choice between competing discourses of  divinity and the consequences of his decisions, including his fall, his  paranoia, and the divisions among his children. In his narrative, Los  reacts to Albion’s actions as well as to his own Spectre and Emanation  in order to consolidate error and to keep the Divine Vision by building  Golgonooza and the Mundane Shell. The narrator’s story of attempting to  write the poem parallels Los’s story: like Los, he feels alone and  helpless as he labors to grasp and represent the consequences of  Albion’s disease manifested in the narrator’s (and the reader’s) world  and time. The fourth thread tells the obscure “anterior myth” of  Tharmas’s murder, Luvah’s trial, and Albion’s seduction by Vala.  Pointing out that the Saviour has access to all four threads, providing  their point of unification into a single story, Yoder begins the work of  interpreting the poem’s portrayal of the relationship between the human  and the divine.

In this chapter, Yoder does scholars a genuine  service by detailing the scenes that belong to each thread and by  telling the stories as they unfold within each of the poem’s four  chapters, explaining conflicts, errors, deceptions, and resolutions.  Part of his discussion is a tour de force demonstration of the narrative  order of the sequence of two four-plate blocks within plates 28-50,  chapter 2, rearranged by Blake in two copies. His discussion is both  revelatory for its impact on how we should understand Blake’s purposes  and a discrete warrant for his claims about the narrative structure of  the poem. The difference that the new contexts of the rearranged plates  make for the narrative requires an extensively detailed discussion, too  complex for recapitulation here. Suffice it to say that I am persuaded  through this explication that Yoder has truly understood the purport of  the poem’s form. He asks: “Why the trouble with Chapter 2? In Chapter 2  Albion’s fall is not yet irrevocable. … Chapter 2 is about the  possibility of saving Albion from himself. … The role of Chapter 2 in  the narrative of Jerusalem is to hold open the moment of  Albion’s fall, in the possibility that it might be understood and  prevented” (94-95). Agreeing with both Paley and De Luca that chapter 2  is the key to the poem, Yoder stakes his argument for the critical  function of narrative, in a counter to these scholars, on this  successful and fascinating demonstration.
                 
 
       
6
       
The third chapter articulates some of the  difficulties that readers encounter when trying to follow the poem’s  narrative threads. Referring to these difficulties as a function of  Blake’s “rhetoric of discontinuity,” Yoder regards Blake’s delay of  speech attribution, his use of characters who “divide and reunite,” his  spatial reorientation, and the problems of knowing when a scene opens or  closes as the key strategies for disrupting our expectations about  narrative structure. But identifying characters, attributing speech,  distinguishing the parameters of a dialogic space, and recognizing  scenic shifts are fundamental readerly functions. Why, then, does Blake  obscure them at some times and not at others? Yoder closely reads a  large number of plates both to demonstrate the presence of an  oscillation between clarity and obscurity of the narrative and to  indicate how Blake is seeking actively to transform his reader to learn  what Albion must learn about the unity of mankind and individuality of  minute particulars.

Yoder does far more than simply repeat in other  words what Blake and his many explicators have said about the variation  in “Perceptive Organs” and their “Objects of Perception” or about the  expansion and contraction of the senses. He actually demonstrates how  this happens in specific and abundant detail. I cannot do justice to his  exposition, but perhaps an extended example will indicate the  usefulness of his method: 
In the first part of Chapter 3, the scene changes are often  punctuated with plate shifts, while in the second part of the chapter  such correspondences are repeatedly undermined. … I divided Jerusalem’s  Chapter 3 into eight scenes; of the seven transition points between  scenes, the first four occur at plate shifts (55.1, 56.1, 60.1, 63.1).  However, the end of the scene that begins at 63.1 violates that pattern  in a way that emphasizes the change. The scene is a long depiction of  the blood orgy, and it ends with a vision of the aggregate male, Hand,  and the aggregate female, Rahab, whose “Brain enlabyrinths the whole  heaven of her bosom and loins” (70.29). At the bottom of plate 70,  separated from the verse paragraph immediately above is the single line,  “The Starry Heavens all were fled from the mighty limbs of Albion”  (70.32). This line, marking the end of the plate, makes a fitting end to  the violence of the blood orgy and the eerie calm of the closing vision  of the aggregate male and female. But when plate 71 opens, “And above  Albions Land was seen the Heavenly Canaan” (71.1), that closing line  must be reread as the opening line of the spatial reorientation that  introduces the “exploration of states.” This use of the single opening  line to straddle the change of plates is mirrored later when the final  line of the exploration scene appears as the first line of text on plate  73. The very minuteness of the violation of the expected pattern—the  use of a single line to create a tension between the expected reading  and the necessary rereading—emphasizes the danger of passive reading ….  Instead, lines of continuity overlay points of demarcation, creating a  narrative characterized by bright spots of drama that expand and  contract according to the reader’s perceptions. (122-23)
 This level of detail is a hallmark of Yoder’s discussion, and even  though this is a short book, it has ample close readings, each of which  not only makes Yoder’s larger point about the narrative structure of the  poem but also adds to the reader’s appreciation of the poem’s artistry  and philosophy. In this chapter, Yoder is concerned to help the reader  understand why narrative is critical to Blake’s purposes, for without  the impulse to follow the narrative (an impulse blocked by the  synchronic approach), the reader will not have a reason to engage in the  recalibrations of identity, spatiality, and organization that form the  very intellectual exercise the poem is designed to foster. Narrative is  necessary to change the reader’s mind.

The final chapter takes up the more daunting  challenge of articulating the poem’s staging of “the conflict between  the competing claims of divine authority that drive the plot of Jerusalem”  (125). Arguing against some scholars (my younger self included) who  despair of finding a textual basis for choosing between the Saviour’s  and the Spectre’s claims to divinity—because the claims mirror each  other and because both are predicated on rhetorical constructions of  authority—Yoder advances the plausible notion that Blake does give the  reader grounds for making a decision, even in the face of such  uncertainty: “The basis for deciding between the divine discourse of the  Saviour and that of the Spectre lies in the difference between their  responses to the problem of sin, and in Jerusalem the Saviour  offers a system of forgiveness so radical that it shocks even Los and  the poem’s narrator” (126). This chapter is a virtuoso synthesis of  Blake’s corpus and its attendant scholarship as well as a sensitive  reading of the poem to support that claim. It should be read for its  clear explanation of the core of Jerusalem and its compelling demonstration of the reasons why Blake shaped his poem the way that he did.

The book has some weaknesses: for experienced  Blake scholars, the long reprise of the “synchronic” school may be  tedious and even argumentative, even though Yoder is at pains to  delineate critical differences (which may make it particularly useful  for students). The third chapter could benefit from more examples of  extended readings. In citing parts of the text that exemplify one or  another point, he doesn’t offer expanded interpretations. But these are  minor complaints in the context of the very important work that this  book represents. After my first reading, I wished that Yoder had gone on  to write a comprehensive explication of the poem in sequence and in  detail, as Donald Ault has done for The Four Zoas in Narrative Unbound.  But on a second reading, I was well satisfied that Yoder’s explanation  of the poem’s unique enterprise, special techniques, and inspiring  philosophy offers an indispensable introduction to Jerusalem.

In There Is a Happiness That Morning Is,  Mickle Maher has imagined a witty, amusing, and moving love story about  two college professors, inspired by two of William Blake’s poems. The  first poem, “Infant Joy” from Songs of Innocence, is taught by the exuberant Bernard (Colm O’Reilly). The second, “The Sick Rose” from Songs of Experience,  is taught by the precise, severe Ellen (Diana Slickman). The college  dean, James (Kirk Anderson), serves as the worm in this Garden of Eden.  The audience serves as the students in the classroom. William Blake,  eighteenth-century poet, is front, center stage. His poems, chalked with  artistic flourish on a large blackboard which dominates the stage, are  always in front of the student–audience. They are referred to again and  again by the characters, speaking in verse. So skilled are the actors  that this seems natural, while it adds texture and increases the  emotions of the plot.

Tension develops from the public lovemaking of  these two teachers, witnessed by the dean. James, speaking in prose in  contrast to Bernard and Ellen, insists that the two apologize publicly.  An argument among the three ends with the dean being tossed to the floor  in so realistic a manner that the audience is called upon for a doctor.  When a doctor proves unnecessary, Bernard and Ellen return to making  love, to everyone’s relief. To be convincing, this one-act play needs  the best of actors, as it had in this production. The starkness of the  set, a blackboard with two podiums, serves to focus the audience on the  Blake poems and the developing, multilayered, imaginative love story.

“an excellent saleswoman”: The Last Years of Catherine Blake
         
By Angus Whitehead
         
Angus Whitehead (whitehead65_99@yahoo.co.uk)  is assistant professor in English Literature at the National Institute  of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. He is  co-editor of Envisioning Blake, which will be published by Palgrave in February.

Biographical information concerning any period of the life of Catherine Sophia Blake, née Boucher (illus. 1),  remains lamentably sparse. However, few twenty-first-century scholars  would agree with Mona Wilson’s comment, made about 1927, that “there is  little independent record of Catherine Blake, nor is it needed.” [1]  For the four years following Blake’s death, Catherine was the custodian  and saleswoman of a varied and substantial collection of her husband’s  works, as well as his drawing, painting, engraving, and printing  materials. She was also a unique source for much information about his  life and working practices communicated to Frederick Tatham, his fellow  Ancients, and other friends and visitors. For almost forty-five years  she was the person who lived and worked most closely with Blake,  enabling him to realize numerous projects, impossible without her  assistance. Catherine was an artist and printer in her own right, with  firsthand knowledge and experience of Blake’s art practices. [2]  And yet in surviving contemporary records written during and after her  marriage, she was principally commended for her domestic role. [3]

In the last two decades interest in and  recognition of Catherine’s position in Blake’s life and work have grown.  In 1993 Joseph Viscomi asserted her integral role in all aspects of  Blake’s bookmaking projects. [4] In 2004 she was given her own entry in the new edition of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. [5] Eugenie R. Freed, in her review of Barbara Lachman’s fictionalized life, Voices for Catherine Blake: A Gathering (2000), observed:         
Like many of those interested in Blake’s work, I do feel  the need to know a great deal more about Catherine Blake, an unsung  heroine who has yet to be acknowledged as the courageous woman of many  parts that she had to be in real life. [6]

As this essay will demonstrate, scholars have yet  to exhaust all avenues in reclaiming historical information concerning  the life of Blake’s wife. Hitherto, the final four years of her life  (1827-31) have received negligible attention from Blake’s biographers.  Only G. E. Bentley, Jr., has attempted a detailed chronological  reconstruction of where Catherine lived during those years. In the  second edition of Blake Records he suggests that after six  months living and working at 6 Cirencester Place, John Linnell’s town  house and painting studio (Sept. 1827-c. Mar. 1828), the recently  widowed Catherine lived, briefly, alone in lodgings at 17 Upper  Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, before residing with Tatham and his  wife at 20 Lisson Grove North (Apr. 1828-spring 1829). According to  Bentley, she then returned to her former residence in Upper Charlotte  Street. [7]

Bentley’s reconstruction, based on contemporary  data and informed guesswork, provides our most reliable picture of her  last years to date. We can be certain that she lived at Cirencester  Place for the first six months of her widowhood. [8]  However, reliable information about the remaining three and a half  years of her life is meager. A close inspection of Bentley’s chronology  reveals that we really know little of Catherine’s life or whereabouts  after she left Tatham in the early spring of 1829. Moreover, the precise  nature of Tatham’s domestic arrangements is unknown. Bentley’s  assertion that Catherine resided with and worked for Tatham and his wife  at Lisson Grove, although apparently widely accepted, is based on  circumstantial evidence and has not been fully investigated. Tatham’s  wife, the “Mrs. Tatham” in whose arms Catherine died, [9]  has not been identified, nor has any Blake biographer recovered the  precise location of the last residence of Catherine Blake. Although it  is clear that she resided at no. 17, it has not been established whether  her final lodgings were in Charlotte Street, Upper Charlotte Street,  Charlton Street, or Upper Charlton Street, Fitzroy Square.

This essay presents and explores new information  concerning the life, residences, and circle of Catherine Blake in the  period immediately following her departure from Linnell’s town house, c.  March 1828, until her death in mid-October 1831. It revises a number of  Bentley’s assertions regarding the chronology and location of her  residences. The essay will also explore her relationship with Frederick  Tatham, the member of the Ancients with whom she had most contact after  Blake’s death, and who—rightly or wrongly—inherited the Blakes’ earthly  possessions after Catherine’s demise.

1. Catherine Blake in Widowhood, 1827-31         
When William Blake died on the evening of 12 August 1827, Catherine was left a considerable number of unsold works [10]  but little ready money, and she appears to have been unable to support  herself. That day she was obliged to borrow five pounds from Blake’s  patron Linnell. [11] In a  letter to Linnell written two days later, John Constable expressed the  hope that the Royal Academy would “do something handsome for the widow”  and gave him advice as to how to apply to the academy’s benevolent fund  on Catherine’s behalf. [12]  Nevertheless, about a week after Blake’s death Catherine appeared  intent on continuing to print from a rolling press, presumably in an  effort to market her husband’s works and support herself. About 18  August James Lahee, copperplate printer of Castle Street, Oxford Market,  wrote in response to a query from Linnell that he was willing to accept  the Blakes’ old press: “if it happens not to be larger than Grand  Eagle, and it is a good one in other respects I have one idle which  would answer Mrs B’s purpose.” [13]  However, the proposed project to swap presses appears not to have  materialized, as four days later Linnell arranged for Blake’s star wheel  rolling press to be moved from 3 Fountain Court to Cirencester  Place. [14] Catherine followed two weeks after the press.

During the period in which she lived with Linnell  and then with Tatham, Catherine’s principal means of support derived  from her performance of the duties of a domestic housekeeper. While at  Cirencester Place she was also responsible for accepting money from  Linnell’s customers when he was not at home. [15]  Nevertheless, from the autumn of 1827 she began occasionally to sell  her late husband’s works to visitors. With Linnell’s assistance, she  sold Blake’s last commission, a name plate, as well as a copy of Illustrations of the Book of Job, to his old friend George Cumberland. [16] Catherine also attempted to encourage Cumberland to try to sell further copies of Job in Bristol, despite the fact that he had been unable to sell the copy he had received from Blake some months earlier. [17]

Although on 8 December Linnell loaned Catherine a further five pounds, [18]  a month later she was clearly beginning to establish a customer base  for her husband’s works. On 8 January 1828 she sold three copies of  “Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims” to the judge and writer Barron Field and  Blake’s acquaintance Henry Crabb Robinson (one of the copies was for  Charles Lamb). On this occasion, Catherine agreed to look out other  engravings. [19] On 17 March Mrs. Samuel Smith and Miss Julia Smith called on Catherine and paid eight guineas for Lear and Cordelia in Prison (1779) and A Female Figure Crouching in a Cave. [20] Alexander Gilchrist describes Catherine’s marketing skills as well as her finishing of Blake’s works during this period:         
She was an excellent saleswoman, and never committed  the mistake of showing too many things at one time. Aided by Mr. Tatham  she also filled in, within Blake’s lines, the colour of the Engraved  Books; and even finished some of the drawings—rather against Mr.  Linnell’s judgment. [21]

About March 1828 Catherine moved to live with and  work for Frederick Tatham. The numerous obituaries of Blake which  appeared in the year following his death, followed by the publication of  J. T. Smith’s Nollekens and His Times (1828), which  featured a biography, appear to have enhanced Catherine’s chances of  selling works. Smith wrote that “[Blake’s] beloved Kate survives him  clear of even a sixpenny debt; and in the fullest belief that the  remainder of her days will be rendered tolerable by the sale of the few  copies of her husband’s works, which she will dispose of at the original  price of publication.” [22] In early November he wrote to Linnell, “What I have said of your worthy friend Blake I am fully aware has been servisable [sic] to his widow.” [23] Later that month the barrister, antiquary, and art collector William Twopenny contacted Smith:         
My dear Sir,      Can you tell me where the Widow of Blake the artist lives.          Yours most truly              Wm. Twopenny Temple      19. Nov. 1828 [24]
         Catherine’s business acumen, as well as her belief in vision and  her husband’s continued presence, is perhaps apparent in her informing  Linnell on 27 January 1829 that “Mr Blake told her he thought I shd. pay 3gs. a piece for the Plates of Dante—.” [25]
                 
10
       
By April 1829 Catherine was able to live  independently in her own lodgings. This was almost certainly facilitated  by a bequest of twenty pounds, furniture, and apparel from her  brother-in-law and former landlord, Henry Banes, who had died in  January. [26] Customers continued to approach her in order to purchase Blake’s works. On 11 April Tatham informed a potential patron:         
   In behalf of the widow of the late William Blake, I have to inform you that her circumstances render her glad to embrace  your Kind offer for the purchase of some of the works of her departed husband. …    This elevated widow is now seeking a support during the remainder of her exemplary course, through the medium of the  enlightened and the generous …. Should you, Sir, be inclined to possess, for the embellishment of your own collection, and the  benefit of the widow, any of the enumerated works, they shall be carefully sent to you upon your remitting the payment, and I  will take proper care that your Kindness shall be rewarded with the best impressions, and that you shall be used in a manner  that shall not cause you to regret your absence from the scene of purchase.    And communicating either with myself or Mrs. Blake, you will Receive her ample thanks and the acknowledgements                                                                                                             of your obedient and humble Servant                                                                                                                   Frederick Tatham [27]
         About this time Catherine or Tatham sent to James Ferguson “a  List of Works by Blake offered for sale by his widow.” [28]
                 
11
       
In July 1829 Catherine sold The Characters of Spenser’s “Faerie Queene”  to the Earl of Egremont for eighty-four pounds, and on 1 August she  left the work, together with a “descriptive Paper,” at his town  residence in Grosvenor Place. [29] The sale provided further financial security. In early 1830 Allan Cunningham’s life of Blake appeared in volume 2 of his Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects,  and the discussion provoked in newspapers and journals ensured that  Blake’s name, as well as Catherine’s, reached an even wider  audience. [30] By the  summer of 1831 she was probably too ill to print, color, or sell Blake’s  works. Gilchrist describes the stock in Catherine’s possession at her  death as “still considerable.” [31]
                 
12
       
In addition to selling Blake’s works, Catherine, an accomplished operator of a rolling press, [32]  printed from the large number of copperplates in her possession.  According to J. T. Smith, Blake “allowed her, till the last moment of  his practice, to take off his proof impressions and print his works,  which she did most carefully, and ever delighted in the task.” [33]  Around 1827 Catherine, perhaps assisted by Linnell, may have utilized  Blake’s old press at Cirencester Place to take proofs of the Dante  plates. [34] Bentley states that later “she and Tatham printed Blake’s copperplates of America, Europe, Jerusalem, and the Songs ….” [35] For the Sexes copies E-I were probably printed by either Catherine or Tatham. [36]  She also appears to have colored and finished Blake’s prints, drawings,  and other works from stock. Essick observes that “she may have  completed several of Blake’s projects, left unfinished at his death,  including his watercolour illustrations to Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress.” [37]  In addition, while at Tatham’s Catherine produced at least one painting  of her own, a watercolor of a head “taken from something she saw in the  Fire …” (illus. 2). [38]

According to Gilchrist, “the poet and his wife  did everything in making the book,—writing, designing, printing,  engraving,—everything except manufacturing the paper: the very ink, or  colour rather, they did make.” [39] Smith observes that both William and Catherine colored “the marginal figures up by hand in imitation of drawings.” [40] Tatham records that Catherine         
laboured upon [Blake’s] Works[,] those parts of them  where powers of Drawing and form were not necessary, which from her  excellent Idea of Colouring, was of no small use in the completion of  his labourious designs. This she did to a much greater extent than is  usually credited. [41]
         His statement suggests that she had the experience and ability  to color her husband’s works confidently and more than competently after  his death.
                 
14
       
This evidence suggests that Catherine could  print, color, and finish her husband’s works and sell a respectable  number to a growing customer base. However, the precise location of  Tatham’s residence where she lived and worked from 1828 to 1829 has  received little attention.
                 
15
       
2. Catherine Blake’s Residence with Frederick Tatham, c. March 1828-April 1829         
On Linnell’s departure during the spring of 1828 from  Cirencester Place to his new family home and studio at 26 Porchester  Terrace, Bayswater, Catherine moved to the residence of her friend  Tatham. [42] In his “Life of Blake,” completed c. 1832, Tatham wrote:         

After the death of her husband she resided for  some time with the Author of this[,] whose domestic arrangements were  entirely undertaken by her; until such changes took place that rendered  it impossible for her strength to continue in this voluntary office of  sincere affection and regard. [43]
         However, her working and domestic relationship with Tatham  probably differed from that which she had experienced with Linnell.  While using Cirencester Place as a studio during the week, Linnell spent  the majority of his free time, weekends, and evenings with his wife and  young family at their farm cottage at North End, Hampstead. [44]  During these periods Catherine Blake was a house sitter, relaying  messages concerning customers and other callers to Linnell via nephews  in his employment. [45]  She may have been similarly employed at Tatham’s. However, whereas  Linnell appears to have paid her twenty pounds for her six-month  employment at Cirencester Place, [46] Tatham describes her role as a “voluntary office.”
                 
16
       
She seems to have enjoyed a closer relationship  with Tatham than with Linnell. While he does not mention remunerating  Catherine, he probably treated her in her “voluntary office” as a friend  or guest rather than as a servant or dependent. He uses the phrase  “maternal loveliness” to describe the nature of her role. [47]  Catherine was in her sixties and childless with only two surviving  relatives, while Tatham was approximately twenty-three. A quarter of a  century earlier, a former fellow resident and wife of the Blakes’ first  landlord at South Molton Street, “the young and very amiable Mrs Enoch. … gave [Catherine] all the attention that a daughter could pay to a mother.” [48] Tatham may have found himself filling a similar role as surrogate son.
                 
17
       
Catherine may have had another reason for her  “maternal loveliness.” During this period Tatham appears to have  suffered from a debilitating mental and physical illness, causing his  family and friends considerable concern. In a letter to George Richmond  dated 12 May 1827, Samuel Palmer wrote “Pray Sir bring a very particular  account of Mr Tatham’s health.” [49] Tatham was still ill three months later when he traveled ninety miles to attend Blake’s funeral on 17 August. [50] In October 1828 Palmer wrote to Richmond, “I am rejoiced to hear that Mr Tatham is much better.” [51]  A letter to Linnell from Tatham’s father, the architect Charles  Heathcote Tatham, in early 1828 seems to suggest that Frederick was  suffering from a long-term and recurrent illness:         
I hear you still consult that Top-sawyer [eminent  personage] Thornton. He has been a thorn in my side; but I endeavour to  forget his unsuccessful and expensive experiments upon my poor  son. [52]
         Catherine Blake may therefore have spent at least part of her  time performing the duties of a sick nurse and carer, as she had for her  husband less than a year earlier.
                 
18
       
Catherine’s “voluntary” service for Tatham may  have derived in part from affection for a young man who, despite  personal inconvenience both in distance and health, had attended Blake’s  funeral and shown care and concern for her in the first six months of  her widowhood. Tatham and his wife would later nurse and attend  Catherine at her deathbed, and she died in Tatham’s wife’s arms. The  couple organized, attended, and almost certainly paid for her funeral,  which she requested should follow the form of her husband’s four years  earlier. [53] Linnell, by  contrast, appears not to have been present at either funeral, possibly  because both were conducted according to the Church of England’s service  for the burial of the dead. As a strong-minded dissenter who had  traveled to Scotland in order to avoid a Church of England marriage  ceremony, he appears to have preferred to offer Catherine financial  assistance. [54]
                 
19
       
In his “Life of Blake” Tatham does not specify  his address during the period of Catherine Blake’s residence with him,  nor does he provide precise information concerning the length of her  stay. He simply states that she lived with him “for some time.” Until  1969, no Blake biographer had discussed either the location or the  duration. In the first edition of Blake Records, however,  Bentley asserted that from 1828 until 1831 Catherine resided with Tatham  and his wife at 20 Lisson Grove North, northwest London. [55]  During the running dispute with Linnell concerning ownership of the  Dante watercolors and plates, Tatham corresponded from this address on  15 March 1831 and again, twice, on 1 March 1833. [56] Lisson Grove North is also the address he gives at the end of his “Life of Blake,” written c. 1832. [57]  This, therefore, was certainly his residence during the period 1831-33.  Bentley appears to have concluded that Tatham had resided there with  Catherine three years earlier. However, an examination of the Marylebone  poor rate book entries reveals that neither Frederick Tatham, Mrs.  Tatham, nor Catherine Blake lived at this address in spring 1828.
                 
20
       
According to the rate book for 1828, the year  Catherine moved to Tatham’s residence, the ratepayer for 20 Lisson Grove  North was Edward Sewell. [58] Pigot’s Directory for the same year reveals that Sewell, a carpenter and builder, ran his business from the property, a house “and shops.” [59] The following year, the address had no recorded ratepayer; [60]  it was almost certainly unoccupied. Further evidence suggests that  Tatham did not move to Lisson Grove North before 1830. As discussed  earlier, on 11 April 1829 he wrote from “34. Alpha Road. Regent’s Park.  London” in reply to a potential patron who had expressed interest in  purchasing copies of Blake’s works from Catherine. [61] This was the residence of his father. [62]
                 
21
       
It is also unlikely that Tatham and Catherine lived at 20 Lisson Grove during the first half of 1830. In Clayton’s Court Guide for 1830, “F. Tatham Esq.” is listed as residing in Alpha Road, presumably with his father at no. 34. [63] The Marylebone rate books reveal that the ratepayer for 20 Lisson Grove North that year was “Wm. Eales”; Robson’s Directory for 1830 records “William Eales, Timber Merchant” as conducting business there. [64]

Tatham appears as ratepayer at 20 Lisson Grove North in 1831, [65] the year that he is first recorded at this address in a trade directory: Robson’s Directory for 1831 includes “Frederick Tatham, Statuary and Marble works, 20 Lisson Grove.” [66]  It seems clear that he did not live and work there before mid- to late  1830, so his residence c. March 1828, when Catherine moved from  Linnell’s, must have been elsewhere.
                 
23
       
During the period 1829-30 Tatham was spending a  significant amount of time at 34 Alpha Road with his parents and  numerous siblings. It could be argued that, as he was probably living  there during the spring of 1828, Catherine moved from Cirencester Place  to stay with the entire family at this address. She could have acted as  housekeeper and helped look after C. H. and Harriet Tatham’s younger  children: 17-year-old Julia, 15-year-old Harriet, 14-year-old Augusta,  11-year-old Maria, 8-year-old Georgiana, 6-year-old Edmund, and  4-year-old Robert Bristow. [67]  However, this seems unlikely. In his “Life of Blake” Tatham recalled  that his “domestic arrangements were entirely undertaken” by Catherine.  Gilchrist, who interviewed Tatham about 1860, refers to his residence as  “chambers,” [68] a  description which suggests a professional working environment, probably  for a bachelor. Tatham is perhaps recollecting a period in which he  lived, at least part of the time, alone in his own residence. As we  shall see, 34 Alpha Road was not Tatham’s sole residence in 1828.
                 
24
       
Tatham’s letter of 11 April 1829, discussed  earlier, indicates the period in which he and Mrs. Blake shared the same  address. Heading his letter 34 Alpha Road, he describes Catherine as  living independently in lodgings near Fitzroy Square. [69]  This suggests that she and Tatham shared an address from c. March 1828,  when she left Cirencester Place, until no later than the beginning of  April 1829, barely a year. In the following paragraphs a more probable  location for their residence will be suggested.
                 
25
       
In 1824 Tatham was awarded a silver palette by the Society of Arts “for a [plaster] model of a figure from antique”; [70] he exhibited A Negro’s Head and The Angel Gabriel—A Sketch at the Royal Society of British Artists in 1829. [71] In both cases his address is given as “1 Queen Street, Mayfair,” [72] the location of his father’s practice as an architect, 1809-33. [73]  Frederick almost certainly used rooms or “chambers” above his father’s  practice as his painting and sculpture studio and residence. This  upper-floor residence in Queen Street is probably the address to which  Catherine Blake moved in the spring of 1828.
                 
26
       
In a letter to Linnell written from 1 Queen  Street on a Friday towards the end of 1828, C. H. Tatham refers to  leaving home in Alpha Road that morning in order to travel to work at  his offices in Queen Street: “Had the weather been tolerable, I should  have walked up to you; and hesitated some time this morning before I  quitted Alpha Road.” [74]  Another letter to Linnell, written two years earlier, suggests that  both C. H. and Frederick Tatham had slept at Alpha Road the previous  night:         
Queen Street, Mayfair, Monday May 1  Dear Linnell, I am fully confident and very grateful to you for your friendship and kind offices to my dear Frederick—The distance between  my house and yours is great and much time is necessarily consumed in walking to and fro but as I was last night kept up till  half past 11 o’clock in anxious suspense for his return, for a good hour—will you assist me to persuade him in future  in the way you can very kindly do, not to stay so late—As I grow older I am not less nervous—You can consider this private.                                                                                                                                Yours ever,                                                                                                                                  C.H.T. [75]
         Just as Linnell had used Cirencester Place as his studio and  spent his free time with his family at Hampstead until spring 1828,  Frederick Tatham in all probability spent his working hours at his  studio on an upper floor in Queen Street but stayed with his parents and  siblings at Alpha Road at weekends and on occasion overnight during the  week. If this was the case, Catherine Blake may have spent only a  limited amount of time in Tatham’s company. As C. H. Tatham paid the  rates, Catherine would technically have been his lodger. It is therefore  likely that Tatham Sr. played an instrumental role in sheltering and  employing her. [76]
                 
27
       
By the spring of 1828 Catherine Blake and C. H.  Tatham had known each other for over a quarter of a century. The  frontispiece to America copy B is inscribed “From the author to C H Tatham Octr. 7 1799.” [77] It also seems likely that Blake was a subscriber to two of the elder Tatham’s works, published in 1799 and 1802. [78] In a letter to Linnell of 1824, Tatham Sr. referred to his old friend as “Michael Angelo Blake.” [79] Indeed, despite Linnell’s claim that he introduced Frederick Tatham to Blake, [80]  Frederick’s acquaintance with William and Catherine was more likely the  result of the Blakes’ long-standing friendship with his father.
                 
28
       
Sometime after 1820, Catherine attached a note in  her own hand to a copy of Blake’s engraving of the celebrated Plymouth  divine Rev. Robert Hawker:         
Mr C Tatham                        The humble is formed to adore;                        the loving to associate                                                         with eternal Love                                                                         C Blake [81]
         It is unclear when she inscribed the note and when the print was presented. In the first edition of Blake Records  Bentley claimed that Blake presented it in August 1824 because “Aug.  4th, 1824 is the only time after 1820 when Blake and C. H. Tatham are  known to have been together.” [82]  In fact they met on at least one subsequent occasion; according to  Blake’s letter to Linnell of 15 March 1827, C. H. Tatham visited 3  Fountain Court the previous day. Blake writes:         
I saw Mr Tatham Senr yesterday  he sat with me above an hour and lookd over the Dante he expressd  himself very much pleasd with the designs as well as the  Engravings. [83]
         Catherine could therefore have given him the engraving during  this visit. As Bentley (more recently) and Essick have observed,  however, the fact that the note is signed by Catherine suggests that the  engraving was presented during the period of her widowhood. [84]
                 
29
       
As C. H. Tatham paid the rates at 1 Queen Street,  Frederick must have consulted his father before inviting Catherine to  live and work there. It seems probable that during the spring of 1828,  approximately a year after his last recorded visit to Fountain Court,  Tatham Sr. assisted his eldest son in providing a home for his old  friend Catherine Blake. [85]  If this was the case, Catherine could have presented him with the  engraving during her residence there, c. March 1828-April 1829. [86] If Blake’s old press had been set up in Frederick’s chambers, she may even have printed a fresh impression of the plate.
                 
30
       
3. Catherine Blake: Housekeeper to Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Tatham or to Frederick Tatham, Bachelor?         
Bentley states in the first edition of Blake Records that “Catherine Blake lived as housekeeper to Frederick Tatham and his wife.” [87] In the final section of his “Life of Blake,” Tatham mentions his wife’s relationship with Catherine:         

[Catherine] was followed to her grave by 2 whom  she dearly loved, nay almost idolized, whose welfare was interwoven with  the chords of her life and whose well being was her only solace, her  only motive for exertion and her only joy. The news of any success to  them was a ray of Sun in the dark twilight of her life. Their cares were  hers, their sorrows were her own. To them she was as the fondest  mother, as the most affectionate Sister and as the best of friends[;]  these had the satisfaction of putting into her trembling hands the last  cup of moisture she applied to her dying lips and to them she  bequeathed her all. [88]
         He refers to his wife more explicitly in a letter to Linnell sent on the day of Catherine’s death, 18 October 1831: “Mrs  Tatham and myself have been with her during her suffering and have  had the happiness of beholding the departure of a saint for the rest  promised to those who die in the Lord.” [89] Gilchrist states that Catherine “died in Mrs. Tatham’s arms.” [90]  These accounts establish the Tathams’ presence as regular visitors at  her last residence, overnight attendants at her deathbed, and two of the  six friends who attended her burial at Bunhill Fields on 23 October.  However, they provide no evidence for Bentley’s suggestion that upon  leaving Cirencester Place Catherine became housekeeper to Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Tatham.
                 
31
       
In July 1927 the biographer Henry Curtis asked in Notes and Queries,  “Can any reader supply the dates of marriage and death, as also the  parentage and maiden name of the wife of Frederick Tatham, eldest son of  Chas. Heathcote Tatham, 1772-1842, a famous architect?” [91] His query appears to have remained unanswered. In the index to the second edition of Blake Records, Tatham’s wife is referred to as “Tatham, Mrs Frederick.” [92]
                 
32
       
However, recently discovered information  establishes that Mrs. Tatham did not live at the same residence as  Frederick Tatham and Catherine Blake, c. March 1828-April 1829. The  register of St. Mary Stratford Bow records that Frederick married Louisa  Keen Viney on 25 April 1831, less than six months before Catherine’s  death. [93] It is clear, therefore, that Catherine’s relationship with Louisa Tatham did not involve acting as her housekeeper.
                 
33
       
4. Catherine Blake’s Move to Her Own Lodgings         
As has been established, Tatham wrote a letter from Alpha  Road in April 1829 providing his correspondent with Catherine’s new  address, so she must have left by spring 1829 and possibly several  months earlier. By c. February 1829 she had sufficient funds and  furnishings to support a move to her own lodgings. According to the will  of her brother-in-law and former landlord, Henry Banes, proved on 14  February, she was to receive “half my household goods consisting of  Bedsteads Beds and pillows Bolsters and sheets and pillow Cases  Tables Chairs and crockery and £20 in lawful money of Great  Britain.” [94] Banes, who  died on 20 January 1829, may have informed the Blakes of his intention  to leave them a portion of his money and goods when he wrote a new will  on 9 December 1826. [95]  At that time, the Blakes were lodgers in his house at 3 Fountain Court,  Strand. Two years later, this bequest would have enabled, and may even  have prompted, Catherine’s move. It contributed to what Bentley has  described as her “new-found financial security.” [96]  Moreover, in letters of August 1829 to George O’Brien Wyndham, third  Earl of Egremont, she gave advice on the application of a third coat of  varnish to the design from Spenser’s Faerie Queene, which he  had purchased in July for eighty-four pounds. As Bentley has observed,  this generous payment would have “kept Catherine out of want for the  rest of her life.” [97]  Significantly, in January 1830 she requested that an application to the  Artists’ General Benevolent Institution be withdrawn. [98]

                 
34
       
It seems likely, therefore, that Catherine Blake  moved to her own lodgings near Fitzroy Square, her final earthly  residence, by the spring of 1829. However, the length of time that she  spent there means that the dating of some events must be less precise  than has previously been suggested. One such incident is Tatham’s  difference of opinion with her which culminated in his burning Blake’s  “will” at her lodgings. [99] Bentley, following his chronology of her last residences in the first edition of Blake Records, claims that “the incident took place in 1831.” [100]  However, the revised dating suggests that the disagreement could have  occurred at any time between early spring 1829 and October 1831. [101]
                 
35
       
One significant problem relating to the  chronology of Catherine’s residences remains. Tatham claims that, after  leaving his residence, “[Catherine] then returned to the lodging in  which she had lived previously to this act of maternal loveliness [i.e.,  acting as housekeeper to Tatham].” However, he mentions no place in  which she lived after Blake’s death other than his own: “After the death  of her husband she resided for some time with the Author of  this.” [102] Tatham  does not refer to either Linnell or his town house and studio at 6  Cirencester Place, Fitzroy Square, where Catherine lived until spring  1828. [103] Bentley  appears to interpret his statement as suggesting that Catherine lived in  the same flat both before and after her stay with Tatham. [104]  It is unlikely, however, that she would or could have returned to  exactly the same lodgings. More significantly, the sequence of  residences that I have outlined above makes it improbable that Catherine  could have spent any period of time living independently between  leaving Cirencester Place and moving to Queen Street. Rather, Tatham’s  confusing and inaccurate statement suggests an attempt to skate over  uncomfortable facts. [105]  At the time that he wrote his manuscript biography of Blake (c. 1832),  he and Linnell were no longer on speaking terms. Their alienation was  due firstly to a difference of opinion concerning ownership of Blake’s  Dante watercolors and plates that surfaced in the first half of March  1831. Secondly, Tatham’s claiming the Blakes’ entire estate on  Catherine’s death in October 1831 appears to have annoyed Linnell, who  supported the claim of Blake’s sister. [106]  Tatham may not have wished to revive recent memories of distasteful  arguments or draw attention to his conduct in dealings with Catherine  and Linnell.
                 
36
       
We must also consider the significance of a  meeting between Linnell and Tatham recorded in Linnell’s journal for 29  March 1828: “Mr F. Tatham dined at Hampstead.” David Linnell interprets  this as evidence that         
[Linnell] asked Frederick Tatham to dine with him to  discuss where Mrs Blake should live once he had let Cirencester Place.  Frederick Tatham suggested that Mrs Blake should move into his house and  this was then arranged. [107]
         The date of the entry gives some plausibility to David Linnell’s  reading. As has been established, Catherine probably lodged with Tatham  for a year or less. If she resided in her own lodgings between leaving  Linnell’s and moving to Tatham’s, her stay must have been extremely  brief.
                 
37
       
Significantly, after living with Tatham,  Catherine appears to have chosen to return to the environs of Fitzroy  Square, to the street parallel to Cirencester Place. Perhaps this is  what Tatham meant when he refers to her returning “to the lodging in  which she had lived previously.” She may still have known friends and  potential customers in the neighborhood whom she had met while living  under Linnell’s roof. The sculptor and book illustrator Maria Denman and  her brother Thomas, sister- and brother-in-law of John Flaxman, lived  at 7 Buckingham Street, Fitzroy Square. [108]  Thomas Butts, Blake’s patron for many years and still a customer and  visitor in Blake’s last years, was at 17 Grafton Street, on the corner  of Fitzroy Street and Grafton Street on the edge of Fitzroy Square, two  blocks from Catherine’s new lodgings. [109]  John Constable, who had expressed great concern for Catherine’s welfare  at the time of Blake’s death, lived at 35 Charlotte Street, Fitzroy  Square. [110] The sculptor Joseph Denham (or Dinham), whom Tatham describes as a friend of Catherine’s and a mourner at her funeral, [111] also lived nearby, at 7 Cleveland Street. [112] Another friend who was among the six who attended the funeral, according to Tatham, was “Mr.  Bird Painter”: Isaac F. Bird, the Exeter portrait painter who in 1831  lived at 37 London Street, one block south of Fitzroy Square. [113]
                 
38
       
For the majority of her widowhood (spring  1829-October 1831) Catherine lived independently. With her financial  security ensured by the bequest from Banes and the gift purchase from  Lord Egremont, she was able to support herself by printing, coloring,  and selling her husband’s works, not merely for a few months but for  approximately two and a half years. In the next section the precise  address of her final residence will be established.
                 
39
       
5. The Location of Catherine Blake’s Last Residence and Studio         
In the “Life of Blake” Tatham does not provide the address of  Catherine’s last lodgings. Gilchrist records that “finally, she removed  into humble lodgings at No. 17, Upper Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square,  in which she continued till her death; still under the wing, as it  were, of this last-named friend [Tatham].” [114]  In the numerous biographies of Blake since Gilchrist, the location of  this final residence has not been conclusively identified. Arthur  Symons, Mona Wilson, Thomas Wright, and most recently Jack Lindsay and  James King have followed Gilchrist. [115]  Bentley, however, citing correspondence from Tatham to Linnell and the  Bunhill Fields burying ground order book, asserts in the first edition  of Blake Records that the lodgings were at “17 Charlton Street,” [116] a claim repeated in Blake Records Supplement and The Stranger from Paradise. [117] Peter Ackroyd and Robert Essick have also located Catherine’s last residence at this address. [118] In the second edition of Blake Records,  Bentley states in the appendix of residences that Catherine “lodge[d]  with a baker at 17 Upper Charlotte Street, south-east of Fitzroy  Square,” [119] but the  title of the section reveals some uncertainty: “17 Upper Charlotte or  Charlton Street.” In a footnote Bentley observes that         

there is some ambiguity about the name of the  street; it is called “Upper Charlotte Street” in Tatham’s letter of 11  April 1831 [i.e., 1829] and in Gilchrist … but “Upper Charlton Street”  in Tatham’s letter of 18 Oct 1831 and in the documents for Catherine’s  burial on 20 Oct 1831. [120]

                 
40
       
Catherine’s final residence was in fact at 17  Upper Charlton Street, a block southwest of Fitzroy Square. This is the  address on the two letters sent by Catherine to Lord Egremont in August  1829, [121] and it is also cited in the record for her burial at Bunhill Fields. [122] More recently, Butlin refers to this address in his Paintings and Drawings of William Blake. [123]  Although the information seems widely known, the issue of Catherine’s  last address has not been laid to rest in any biography of Blake.
                 
41
       
The substitution of Charlotte for Charlton in  several of the documents cited above by Bentley might be explained by  the ease with which one can mistakenly be written for the other (an  error I have made several times while researching this paper). The only  contemporary reference to Upper Charlotte Street appears in the  transcription of Tatham’s letter of 11 April 1829, [124]  where a mistranscription of the word Charlton could easily have been  made. More significantly, the omission of Upper from Upper Charlton  Street in discussions of Catherine’s last address and the suggestion  that she lived at 17 Charlton Street have led to a small but important  error in locating the residence. Although, as one would expect, Upper  Charlton Street was directly north of and a continuation of Charlton  Street, the two were individually numbered and were in effect separate  streets (see illus. 3).  However, Catherine’s contemporaries and early biographers used the  names Charlton Street and Upper Charlton Street interchangeably, or  transcribed Charlton as Charlotte, and in the process the precise  location of her last residence was muddled.

In 1830 Cumberland wrote on his copy of For Children: The Gates of Paradise, “Mrs Blake now lives at N 17 Charlton St Fitzroy Square at a Bakers.” [125]  When contemporary directories or rate books are consulted, the last  three words of his note make no sense. Bentley records a Henry Heather  as ratepayer at this address, [126]  but in directories H. C. Heather is listed as conducting business at 17  Charlton Street not as a baker but as a bootmaker. [127] But an examination of directories and rate books for 17 Upper  Charlton Street reveals that although Cumberland erroneously recorded  the address, he does appear to have been correct concerning the  business: in 1829, Thomas Mason ran a bakery from, but was not ratepayer  at, 17 Upper Charlton Street. [128] From 1830 onwards another baker, George Miller, occupied 17 Upper Charlton Street [129]  and, unlike his predecessor, was also ratepayer for the property. Such  evidence appears to confirm the identification of Catherine’s last  residence. [130]
                 
43
       
Two further points concerning her lodging at this  address may be deduced. If, as the rate books suggest, the baker Thomas  Mason and his landlord William Barlter vacated 17 Upper Charlton Street  sometime before mid-1829, at least two living spaces were left free.  The new landlord, George Miller, may therefore have advertised for  lodgers during the period in which Catherine received her bequest from  Henry Banes and began searching for new lodgings in anticipation of  Tatham’s move to Lisson Grove North. It could also be argued that a  change in landlord throws additional doubt upon Bentley’s suggestion  that Catherine occupied the same lodgings both before and after residing  with Tatham. It seems unlikely that she could have lived briefly at  this address in the spring of 1828 and then have returned at a later  date to the same house, which in the intervening period had been taken  over by a new landlord.
                 
44
       
Linnell would have been familiar with 17 Upper  Charlton Street: in his “Autobiography” he recalls that the artist  William Mulready “was really my tutor in everything my companion  playmate and guide … my character was formed by him.” [131]  He also indicates that in “1807—Mullready lived in Upper Charlton  Street, Fitzroy Square,” and observes that “this is where I saw him  often and spoke to him about being his pupil He making designs at this  time for Godwin.” [132]  The catalogue for the exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1807 reveals  that Mulready’s lodgings and studio were at no. 17, presumably on an  upper floor. [133]  Linnell spent one of his formative years learning his craft from a  painter in a house that was later to become the lodgings of Catherine  Blake. The connection with Linnell may even suggest that Blake’s patron  played some role in locating a new residence for Catherine in early  1829.
                 
45
       
The fact that Mulready had previously occupied 17  Upper Charlton Street for a year over two decades earlier may seem of  little importance. However, his use of a room in this house as a  painting studio suggests that Catherine could have printed, colored, and  sold Blake’s work there. Although Gilchrist describes the lodgings as  “humble,” the rateable value of the property was sixty pounds, the  highest in the street [134]  and considerably more than twice the value of the Blakes’ final  residence together at 3 Fountain Court. I have been unable to find a  floor plan or front elevation of no. 17, but an Ordnance Survey map of  the area, published in 1872, reveals the footprint of the building (illus. 4).  In addition, a sketch of the front elevation of one of the terrace  houses on the east side of Upper Charlton Street has been located at the  City of Westminster Archives Centre (illus. 5).  From this evidence we may deduce that no. 17 was a Georgian terrace  with two rooms on each floor, a large front one and smaller back one.  Catherine may have organized her space, almost certainly an upper-floor  apartment, [135] along the lines of her and her husband’s rooms at 17 South Molton Street and 3 Fountain Court. [136]  She may have received visitors in the smaller living room at the back  of the house; a larger front room may have been used to store her stock  of Blake’s paintings, engravings, and drawings. It is likely that she  would also have had room for the furniture inherited from her  brother-in-law. Whether or not she moved into the rooms that Mulready  had utilized, the orientation and light would have been the same. As  Mulready probably chose the residence as suitable for a painting studio,  in her front room Catherine almost certainly had adequate light and  space to set up her own studio for coloring works and perhaps even for  printing on a rolling press. [137]  In the front room, with Tatham’s assistance, she may have printed  posthumous copies of Blake’s illuminated books. The scaled  representation of the footprint of no. 17 on the 1872 survey map reveals  that the front rooms on the upper floors measured approximately 5.49  meters (18 feet) in width and 3.66 meters (12 feet) in depth. This means  that for over two years, Catherine, living independently, had space to  color and sell her late husband’s works and could also resume her role  in printing copies of his illuminated books. [138]

Conclusion         
The material presented in this paper gives us cause to revise  the chronology of the residences and microcultures that Catherine Blake  lived in from 1828 to 1831 (see table below). It has demonstrated that  she did not spend the majority of her final years as housekeeper to  Frederick Tatham and his wife at their house in Lisson Grove North.  Evidence suggests that she resided as housekeeper with Frederick, a  bachelor, in chambers above her old friend C. H. Tatham’s practice as an  architect at 1 Queen Street, Mayfair, from March 1828 until the early  spring of 1829. Catherine’s close young female friend, the wife of  Frederick, has been identified as Louisa Keen Viney Tatham. Evidence has  also been provided to support the argument that Catherine had the means  to and almost certainly did move to her own lodgings in or shortly  before the spring of 1829. Finally, the precise location of her “humble  lodgings,” 17 Upper Charlton Street, Fitzroy Square, has been  established. The residence and the duration of her stay provided her  with the opportunity to sell Blake’s works, finish and color others, and  perhaps print posthumous copies of the illuminated books, and thereby  live independently for the last two and a half years of her life.

In the light of these findings, we can also  revise our view of Catherine. She was not a dependent Blake relict,  reliant upon his old friends and passed from Ancient to Ancient. Upon  inheriting Banes’s bequest, she embarked at the age of sixty-seven on a  period of independence, possibly for the first time in her life. On an  upper floor at 17 Upper Charlton Street, she appears to have continued  her husband’s trade, printing, coloring, and selling works up until her  death, over a year into the reign of William IV. In this constant labor  in old age, she perhaps followed her husband’s maxim of working through  illness. [139] Such unremitting industry may account for her having neglected a bowel complaint that led to her death.
                 
48
       
This emerging picture seems consistent with  Essick’s suggestion that during Blake’s lifetime Catherine was “the more  practical of the two,” [140]  and Mark Crosby and Essick’s discussion of Blake’s tribute to her in  response to William Hayley’s “Klopstockian” compliment. [141]  Contemporary and early accounts portray Catherine as on occasion  unstable, difficult, miserable, and ill. Blake’s own reported behavior  may lead us to suspect that their working and emotional partnership  cannot have been uniformly efficient or idyllic. Nevertheless, Catherine  must also have exhibited during her marriage to Blake the resilience  and financial acumen evident in her later widowhood—to the couple’s  advantage.

3. In a letter to  Richard Monckton Milnes, first Baron Houghton, c. 1870, the painter,  antiquary, and visionary Seymour Kirkup described Catherine as “as good  as a Servant” (G. E. Bentley, Jr., Blake Records, 2nd ed. [New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004] [hereafter BR(2)] 294). She had probably been in service as a maidservant before marrying (see BR[2]  71). There is an account of there being a servant at the Blakes’ house  in the early period of their residence at 13 Hercules Buildings,  Lambeth, in the 1790s. However, according to Tatham, Catherine soon took  over those duties: “(as Mrs. Blake declared …) the more service the more Inconvenience” (“Life of Blake,” quoted in BR[2] 676).

Under the heading for 17 Upper Charlotte or Charlton Street,  Bentley says that “she had returned to Upper Charlotte Street by the  spring of 1829”; under 20 Lisson Grove, he gives Apr. 1828-early 1830  for her residence with the Tathams, but he corrects 1830 to 1829 in  addenda to BR(2) in Blake 40.1 (summer 2006): 39.

15. See BR(2) 471. In a note to the artist and traveler Edward Thomas Daniell written shortly after 11 Sept. 1827, Linnell states, “Mrs Blake … lives with me now here [i.e., Cirencester Place].” George Cumberland addressed his letter dated 25 Nov. to “Mrs. Blake at Mr Linells 6 Cirencester Place” (BR[2] 477fn). However, Linnell spent most of his time at Hampstead with his family (see BR[2] 475). No record of Catherine’s having been invited to help Mrs. Linnell with the children at Hampstead has been traced.
         
16. In Nov. George  Cumberland, Jr., called on Catherine at Cirencester Place; Linnell is  not recorded as present. It appears that Catherine was responsible for  persuading George Cumberland to buy the name plate and a copy of Job (see BR[2]  475, 479). After paying £5.15.6 for these works on 16 Jan. 1828, George  Jr. reported to his father in Bristol that “[Catherine’s] late husbands  works she intends to prin[t] with her own hands and trust to their  sal[e] for a livelihood” (BR[2] 482).
         
17. In his letter to Catherine of 25 Nov., Cumberland explained that he could not sell the copy of Job in his possession. He also suggested a way of marketing the remainder of Blake’s works:         

That elaborate work,  I have not only shewn to all our amateurs and artists here without  success but am now pushing it through Clifton, by means of Mr Lane the  Bookseller there, having previously placed it with Mr Tyson, Mr Trimlet,  and another of our Print Sellers here without success—and as that is  the case, and that even those who desired me to write to my friend for a  List of his works and prices, (among whom were his great admirers from  having seen what I possessed …) declined giving him any orders, on  account, as they said, of the prices—I should not recommend you to send  any more here—but rather to fix a place in London where all his works  may be disposed of offering a complete set for Sale to the BMPR, as that  will make them best known.—better even than their independant author  who for his many virtues most deserved to be so—a Man who has stocked  the english school with fine ideas,—above trick, fraud, or servility. (BR[2] 476)

19. BR(2)  480. In his 1852 “Reminiscences” Robinson added, “[Catherine] informed  us that she was going to live with Linnell as his housekeeper—And we  understood that she would live with him. And he, as it were, to farm her  Services and take all she had—” (BR[2] 705). As Bentley notes, “This sentence is not authorized by Robinson’s Diary or by the probable facts.”

21. Gilchrist 1:  366. He is probably citing interviews with Tatham and possibly Linnell.  However, Catherine’s manner of conducting business may sometimes have  inhibited sales. Discussing his disagreement with Catherine and Tatham  over the ownership of the Dante drawings and plates, Linnell observed on  16 Mar. 1831, “I cd. never obtain any definite account of what she expected or wished me to do” (BR[2] 541). She also appears to have exasperated Tatham (see BR[2] 493-94).
         
22. BR(2) 626.
         
23. BR(2)  490. On 19 Nov. Richmond wrote to Palmer, “Be pleased when you see Mrs B  to present my best respects to her. I hope she is now settled” (BR[2] 491).

27. BR(2) 495-96. In BR(2)  the letter is dated 1 Apr. 1829. However, in answer to my querying this  point, Bentley wrote, “The Frederick Tatham letter is clearly dated, in  the MS copy (of which I have a reproduction), the only evidence of it,  as 11 April 1829 (as in BRS [Blake Records Supplement (1988)]), not as 1 April (as in BR(2)) …” (personal correspondence, 25 Mar. 2005).           For Dennis Read’s identification of Tatham’s correspondent as  the engraver John Pye, see “‘An eminent but neglected genius’: An Early  Frederick Tatham Letter about William Blake,” English Language Notes 19 (Sept. 1981): 30; for a problem associated with that identification, see Whitehead, “‘I also beg Mr Blakes acceptance’” 88n60.
         
28. BR(2) 497. These included copies (probably later pulls) of the 1795 color prints Nebuchadnezzar, Pity, Newton, Christ Appearing to the Apostles after the Resurrection, God Judging Adam, and Satan Exulting over Eve (see BR[2] 871n39).           According to Gilchrist (1: 366), Ferguson “took copies of three or four of the Engraved Books,” probably Visions of the Daughters of Albion, America, and Europe (see BR[2] 481fn).
         
29. BR(2) 497-98.
         
30. See BR(2)  503-08. Catherine is compared in one review to the German poet  Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock’s wife, Margareta (Meeta) Möller. On 27  Apr. 1830, after reading Cunningham’s life, the poet Caroline Bowles  wrote to Robert Southey, “I hope she is not in indigence” (BR[2]  530). In early Mar. 1830 Linnell conducted Haviland Burke to  Catherine’s residence to examine and purchase works for the Bishop of  Limerick (BR[2] 509). Burke paid twenty guineas for “two Drawings” (the untraced Christ Showing the Print of Nails to the Disciples and The Body of Abel Found by Adam and Eve [Butlin #666], possibly a replica by Linnell of Blake’s painting of this name), prints of “Job” and “Ezekiel,” and a copy of Songs.
         
31. Gilchrist 1: 367. The copy of For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise that Tatham gave Mr. Bird on the day of her funeral, 23 Oct. 1831, was probably from this collection (BR[2]  547). In his “Life of Blake” Tatham mentions that at her death  Catherine had “writings, paintings, and a very great number of Copper  Plates” (BR[2] 688).
         
32. See BR(2) 131, 151.
         
33. BR(2)  608. Smith also states that Catherine “became a draughtswoman … and has  produced drawings.” According to Viscomi, “the significance of Blake  printing his own plates and working with his wife cannot be  overestimated” (Idea of the Book 105). If Catherine acted as Blake’s “printer’s devil,” as Viscomi suggests (Idea of the Book 117), or “clean hands,” as Essick describes her role (“Blake, Catherine Sophia,” ODNB),  she would have been well versed in printing as well as coloring, but  may have had less experience in carefully inking relief-etched  copperplates. For the difficulties involved, see Michael Phillips, “The  Printing of Blake’s America a Prophecy,” Print Quarterly 21.1 (2004): 18-38. On Catherine as printmaker, see Viscomi, Idea of the Book 393n4.
         
34. See BR(2) 790 and fn. For evidence of Catherine and Linnell’s printing of the Job plates on Blake’s press at Cirencester Place 1827-28, see BB 519. Catherine’s press work may have been inferior to Blake’s; Bentley notes “numerous minor defects” in her printing of Little Tom the Sailor (BB 578).
         
35. G. E. Bentley, Jr., The Stranger from Paradise: A Biography of William Blake (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001) [hereafter Stranger] 442. Posthumous copies of plates of Songs of Innocence and of Experience, poorly printed in light-blue ink, were on  display at the Tate exhibition of Blake’s works at the Graves Art  Gallery, Sheffield, May-Oct. 2003. Catherine may have printed plates of America (see BB 89), of Jerusalem copies H, I, J (BB 226-27), and of Songs of Innocence and of Experience copies a, b, c, d, f, g1, g2, i, j, k, l, o (BB 370-71).
         
36. Viscomi, Idea of the Book 367.
         
37. “Blake, Catherine Sophia,” ODNB; see also BR(2) 481fn and Butlin #829. Essick has raised the possibility that the colored copies of the Night Thoughts  engravings may also have been colored by Catherine, c. 1797. “They  clearly were not colored after a model, they vary in color placement in  ways similar to the illuminated books colored up (according to Viscomi)  in the same session, the palette slips and slides in tone but seems to  be a matter of continuous color shifts rather than distinctly different  palettes, the quality of the coloring varies greatly in the second half  of many copies (she got tired?), and the colors are odd—the sort of  things one sees in enamel decorations on British soft-paste porcelain of  the eighteenth-century rather than colored prints in books (e.g., the  Stedman, like the Night Thoughts published by a member of the  Edwards family)” (e-mail, 7 Nov. 2005). It is possible that some of  these copies could have been colored by Catherine after Blake’s death.
         
38. Butlin #C2.
         
39. Gilchrist 1: 70, quoted in Viscomi, Idea of the Book 129.
         
40. BR(2) 609.
         
41. BR(2) 690. Viscomi suggests that the following works were probably colored by Catherine, perhaps following a model by Blake: Innocence G and H, Songs C, R, AA, Experience R, America K, Marriage C, Europe A[?], Visions C, H, I, J, K, L, M (see Viscomi, Idea of the Book 133, 142).
         
42. At the same  time, Linnell’s family moved from Collins’s Farm, Hampstead, to  Porchester Terrace. Linnell was evidently in a poor state of health  during this period due to overwork. This may have been another reason  for Catherine’s move.
         
43. Quoted in BR(2)  690. It is unclear what Tatham is referring to by “such changes.”  However, he is probably not alluding here to Catherine’s becoming  “decayed” (a word he uses to describe her later in the “Life,” referred  to by G. E. Bentley, Jr., Blake Records [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1969] [hereafter BR] 567). Catherine’s letter to Lord Egremont suggests that she had personally delivered The Characters of Spenser’s “Faerie Queene” to Grosvenor Place several months after moving to her lodgings (see BR[2]  498). Grosvenor Place is some considerable distance southwest of  Fitzroy Square. Whether she walked or took a carriage with the large  panel on which Blake’s watercolor was mounted (Butlin #811 gives the  dimensions as 18 x 53½ inches), such an errand is likely to have been  beyond the capabilities of a frail woman.
         
44. See David Linnell, Blake, Palmer, Linnell and Co.: The Life of John Linnell (Lewes, Sussex: Book Guild, 1994) 86-87.
         
45. See, for example, BR(2) 482.
         
46. It appears that  Linnell never actually paid Catherine for her housekeeping. In a letter  to Tatham discussing their disagreement over the Dante watercolors and  plates, he stipulates that before giving up the drawings he expects to  be remunerated for the money he gave the Blakes but deducts twenty  pounds for Mrs. Blake’s “taking Care of House andc in Cirencester  Place” (BR[2] 539). However, as he never gave them up, it appears that Catherine never received the benefit of the “discount.”

50. Gilchrist 1: 363. This detail originally appeared in Smith’s Nollekens and His Times:  “Tatham, ill as he was, travelled ninety miles to attend the funeral of  one for whom, next to his own family, he held the highest esteem”  (quoted in BR[2] 626). He may have traveled from Shoreham.  Richmond recalled a visit to Shoreham on 28 June 1827: “I asked my  father’s permission to let me join my dear friends Samuel Palmer and  Harry Waters and (I think) Fredk. Tatham, who were then in humble  fashion lodging in the pretty village” (see A. M. W. Stirling, ed., The  Richmond Papers: From the Correspondence and Manuscripts of George  Richmond, R.A. and His Son Sir William Richmond R.A., K.C.B. [London: William Heinemann, 1926] 16).
         
51. Lister 1: 42. After a trip to London, Palmer wrote “Now for good news … Mr Tatham seems well!” (1: 44).
         
52. See D. Linnell  113-14. Thornton is almost certainly the physician and writer on botany  Robert John Thornton, whose edition of Virgil’s Pastorals (1821) Blake illustrated with a series of woodcuts and whose Lord’s Prayer (1827) he annotated derisively (see BR[2] 376-77, 486; E 667-70).

54. According to his grandson A. H. Palmer, Linnell’s favorite saying was “leave the dead to bury the dead” (Geoffrey Grigson, Samuel Palmer: The Visionary Years [London: Kegan Paul, 1947] 136).
         
55. BR 567 (Bentley gives the dates as “1828-1831?”); in Stranger 444 the dates are the same but Mrs. Tatham is not mentioned; BR(2) 754-55 refers to Catherine’s living with the Tathams from 1828 to spring 1829 (see note 7, above).
         
56. BR(2)  540, 552-53. In a letter which Bentley persuasively argues was written  in 1833, Tatham writes from another address in Lisson Grove, 3 Grove  Terrace (BR[2] 552). However, as I will demonstrate in a paper  on Tatham currently in preparation, it is unlikely that he ever resided  there.

62. The rate books  for the period list Tatham Sr. as ratepayer for the property (see, for  example, COWAC, St. Marylebone rate books, vol. 58, 1831). Linnell  relates that “when I first knew [C. H. Tatham] he lived in a nice house  that he had built one of the Alpha Cottages” (“Autobiography,”  Fitzwilliam Museum Library, Cambridge, f. 42). Both C. H. Tatham and  Linnell were members of the Keppel Street Baptist congregation (see BR[2] 68). Blake visited Alpha Cottages in 1825 (BR[2] 403).
         
63. Clayton’s Court Guide to the Environs of London, 1830 (London:  Clayton, 1830) 214. The catalogue for the Royal Academy exhibition of  1830 records his address as 20 Lisson Grove (see Algernon Graves, The Royal Academy of Arts: A Complete Dictionary of Contributors and Their Work from Its Foundation in 1769 to 1904, vol. 7 [London: Henry Graves and Co. Ltd. and George Bell and Sons, 1906] 325).
         
64. COWAC, St. Marylebone rate books, vol. 58, 1830, part 1; Robson’s Directory  (London: William Robson, 1830) n. pag. Some directories refer to the  residence as 20a Lisson Grove North. However, this appears to be the  same address previously occupied by William Eales: the rateable value,  £45, is the same. 20 Lisson Grove itself, or the “Lodge,” which appears  to have been a more recently built adjoining property, must have been  grander, with a rateable value of £120. The ratepayer was the Rev.  William Cockburn, dean of York and brother-in-law of Robert Peel (COWAC,  St. Marylebone rate books, vol. 60, 1830, part 1).
         
65. COWAC, St.  Marylebone rate books, vol. 60, 1831, part 1. Tatham is listed at “20a  House and shops.” The 1831 census entry for 20 Lisson Grove records  the presence of three males and two females (COWAC).
         
66. Robson’s Directory (1831) n. pag. Palmer bought a house nearby at 4 Grove Street, Lisson Grove, in 1832 (Lister 1: 83n1).
         
67. Linnell speaks  of “many very interesting children all young at that time”  (“Autobiography” f. 42); Palmer regularly refers to the Tatham sisters  in his correspondence (see, for example, Grigson 42). Whether the eldest  sisters Caroline (b. 1803) and Lydia (b. 1807) were still living at  home at this date is unclear. In the spring of 1828 Frederick’s brother  and fellow Ancient, Arthur, was approaching the end of his first year at  Magdalene College, Cambridge.

The Sculpture Room,” London Literary Gazette; and Journal of Belles Lettres, Arts, Sciences (2 May 1829): 289.
         
72. Frederick  Tatham, painter, of “1, Queen Street, Mayfair,” exhibited two portraits  at the Royal Academy of Arts exhibition in 1825 (see Graves 7: 325).
         
73. C. H. Tatham  gives Queen Street as his address in the Royal Academy exhibition  catalogues for 1809 to 1831 (see Graves 7: 324-25).
         
74. Quoted in D.  Linnell 113. In the same letter, Tatham states that “my poor afflicted  son [Frederick] is pulled back and back; the subject is worn out with  me. I wish I could get him abroad; but my hands are tied and bound—my  large family and my decreasing occupations threaten straitened  circumstances. I am the milch cow to fifteen living souls—think of that,  Johnny!” (see Alfred T. Story, The Life of John Linnell, vol. 1 [London: Richard Bentley and Son, 1892] 153).
         
75. D. Linnell 88.  The first of May fell on a Monday in 1820 and 1826; 1820 seems unlikely  because Frederick would have been about fourteen, slightly young for the  independence his father describes.
         
76. It is unclear  whether her duties were merely to attend to Frederick and his chambers  or to act as housekeeper for the whole premises, including the offices  of C. H. Tatham’s practice as an architect.

80. Linnell, “Autobiography” f. 45.
         
81. BR(2) 398. Catherine’s letter to the Earl of Egremont (Aug. 1829) is also signed “C Blake” (BR[2] 498).
         
82. BR 288-89n4.
         
83. E 782-83. C. H. Tatham’s name features in Linnell’s Job accounts for 29 Apr. 1826, which suggests that Tatham and Blake may have met in 1826 (see BR[2] 800).
         
84. “An alternative date for the gift is 1827-31, when Catherine Blake was living as a widow with C. H. Tatham’s son Frederick” (BR[2]  398fn); “It seems improbable … that a gift from Blake to Tatham would  bear a note from Mrs. Blake; it is more probable that the impression was  a gift from Mrs. Blake sometime between Blake’s death on 12 August 1827  and her own death on 18 October 1831” (Robert N. Essick, The Separate Plates of William Blake: A Catalogue [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983] 189).
         
85. As Tatham Sr. is recorded as residing at or working from 1 Queen Street from 1809 (see note 73, above), Catherine may previously have had occasion to visit the premises.
         
86. This context may throw light upon the inscription, a quotation from Lavater’s Aphorisms which William Blake underlined in his copy (see BR[2] 398fn).
         
87. BR 567. The entry in BR(2) reads “Catherine Blake, according to Tatham, ‘resided for some time’ … at 20 Lisson Grove with the Tathams” (755).
         
88. Quoted in BR(2) 690.
         
89. BR(2)  546. Tatham’s language here was probably influenced by the preaching of  his Newman Street Catholic Apostolic Church minister, Edward Irving (see  my paper on Tatham, currently in preparation).

93. A transcription  of the entry in the marriage register reads: “Marriages solemnized in  the Parish of St Mary Stratford, Bow, in the County of Middlesex in the  Year 1831. Frederick Tatham, of this Parish, Bachelor, and Louisa Keen  Viney, of this Parish, Spinster, were married in this Church by banns  this Twenty Fifth Day of April in the Year One Thousand Eight Hundred  and Thirty One By me John Stock. This Marriage was solemnized between  us: Frederick Tatham, Louisa Keen Viney. In the presence of: Henry  Brooke Marriott, James Harris” (p. 179, no. 27).

94. PRO PROB 11/1751, quoted in Whitehead, ‘“I also beg Mr Blakes acceptance’” 83.
         
95. Sarah Banes,  Catherine’s sister and Banes’s wife, had been the sole executrix of his  earlier will. However, she had died in Mar. 1824 (see Whitehead, ‘“I also beg Mr Blakes acceptance’” 83).

101. According to Hogarth, Tatham “left [Catherine]. Early the following morning she called upon [Tatham] …” (BR[2]  494). This suggests that they were living apart when the incident took  place. However, for Catherine to have called upon Tatham during this  period would have meant an early morning walk north from Fitzroy Square  to Lisson Grove North or possibly Alpha Road.
         
102. “Life of Blake,” quoted in BR(2) 690.
         
103. Her stay with Linnell is also not mentioned in Tatham’s letter of 11 Apr. 1829 (BR[2]  495-96). This may suggest that disagreements between Linnell and  Catherine and Tatham had occurred as early as Apr. 1829. However, he may  merely have wished to avoid a detailed description of her movements  since leaving Fountain Court. Note that Tatham also omits any reference  in the letter to Catherine’s period of residence with him.
         
104. BR(2) 754-55; see also Wilson 366.
         
105. In  introductory remarks to his transcription of the “Life of Blake,”  Bentley says, “Tatham is not very trustworthy, but it is probably best  to trust him until we have cause not to” (BR[2] 662).
         
106. See BR(2)  551-60. Tatham claimed, with no corroborating evidence, that Catherine  “bequeathed her all” to him and his wife (“Life of Blake,” quoted in BR[2] 690).
         
107. D. Linnell 116. 
         
108. Robson’s Directory  (London: William Robson, 1836) 434; E 783. Maria Denman and Mary Ann  Flaxman, Flaxman’s sister, were co-executrices and co-inheritors of his  estate (see will of John Flaxman, PRO PROB 11/1720 [proved 17 Jan.  1827]). Both appear to have lived at Buckingham Street. Blake met them  at the Aders’s party on 10 Dec. 1825 (BR[2] 419).

111. BR(2) 691.
         
112. See Graves  2: 333 (under Dinham). At the 1830 Royal Academy exhibition, Dinham  exhibited a “bust of a daughter of C. H. Tatham, Esq.,” and in 1844 a  “bust in marble of Mrs. Richmond.” Grigson (144n3) states that Dinham’s  “bust of George Richmond is in the National Portrait Gallery, and he  exhibited a ‘colossal bust’ of Frederick Tatham at the Society of  British Artists in 1830.” He suggests that Dinham and Bird, another  artist who attended Catherine’s funeral, were Ancients: “They were on  its fringe, at any rate.”
         
113. Graves 1:  200. Tatham’s friendship with this Devonshire artist may be associated  with his brother Arthur’s ordination as rector of Boconnoc with Bradoc  (Broadoak), Cornwall, at Exeter Cathedral in 1832.
         
114. Gilchrist 1: 365. The index to The A to Z of Regency London does not include an Upper Charlotte Street.

123. Butlin p. 625. Bentley gives the address correctly in a footnote in BRS (92n2) but refers to “Charlton Street” elsewhere (xlviii).
         
124. The  original letter has not been traced. It was transcribed by Thomas  Hartley Cromek, son of Blake’s former employer Robert Cromek, in his  manuscript “Recollections of Conversations with Mr. John Pye” (1865)  56-58 (see BR[2] 871n37).
         
125. For Children copy C; see BB 192. Cumberland probably purchased this copy from Catherine while she lived in these lodgings.
         
126. BR(2)  755fn. Bentley’s source at the St. Marylebone Public Library appears to  have checked only the rate book entries for Charlton Street and not  those for Upper Charlton Street.

130. The house  was at the northern end of the east side of the street, almost on the  corner of Carburton Street. Catherine appears to have resided between a  tailor, E. Griffiths, at no. 16 and a small public house, the Lord  Nelson or Nelson’s Head, at no. 18, run by Edward Hughes 1828-30 and  William James Barnard from 1831. Other businesspeople in the street  included a cabinetmaker, painter, pianoforte maker, leather gilder,  chairmaker, stonemason, furniture maker, and five tailors.
         
131. Linnell,  “Autobiography,” f. 33. Elsewhere he writes, “indeed I feel bound to say  that I owe more to [Mulready] than anyone I ever knew” (f. 9). In the  “Autobiography” there are far more references to Mulready than to Blake  or Varley. It is clear that, at the time of writing, Linnell regarded  Mulready as the greatest influence.
         
132. Linnell, “Autobiography,” ff. 31, 33.
         
133. Graves 5: 323.
         
134. Rate book entry for 17 Upper Charlton Street, Fitzroy Square, 1830 (COWAC).
         
135. It is  unclear whether she lived above the baker’s establishment or at the back  of the shop. In 1832 Ann and Edward Maddle, ratepayers at 14 Upper  Charlton Street, had a female lodger, Elizabeth Tuckwell, staying in  their back kitchen (see The Proceedings of the Old Bailey, 1674-1913, http://www.oldbaileyonline.org, t18320906-361). However, in Catherine’s case this seems unlikely.
         
136. See  Whitehead, “William Blake’s Last Residence: No. 3 Fountain Court,  Strand. George Richmond’s Plan and an Unrecorded Letter to John  Linnell,” British Art Journal 6.1 (2005): 21-30, and “‘I write in South Molton Street, what I both see and hear’: Reconstructing William and Catherine Blake’s Residence and Studio at 17 South Molton Street, Oxford Street,” British Art Journal 11.2 (2010): 62-75.
         
137. Whether by early 1829 Catherine still possessed her husband’s press, had replaced it with a smaller one (see BR[2] 467-68), or had no press, has yet to be established conclusively.
         
138. Perhaps her great-nephews Richard and Thomas Best assisted her (see Whitehead, ‘“I also beg Mr Blakes acceptance’”  91n85). Catherine would probably not have had continuous access to the  space needed to operate a rolling press at her two former homes.  However, during her years at 17 Upper Charlton Street, the front room  would have provided a permanent location for printing sessions.

Over  the last two decades, scholars and collectors have been blessed with a  remarkable series of discoveries of unrecorded or long-lost works by  Blake. The list is worth reviewing: [1]         
           
1990: Songs of Innocence copy H, untraced since c. 1953.
           
1991: For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise, ten plates, previously unrecorded. Lady Macbeth and the Sleeping Duncan,  wash drawing, untraced since 1863. Two recto/verso preliminary  drawings, previously unrecorded or at least untraced since 1913, for  Blake’s cover design for Thomas Commins, An Elegy Set to Music (1786). An Encounter in Heaven, wash drawing, previously unrecorded. “The Chaining of Orc,” only the second known impression, previously unrecorded.
           
1992: The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, design only on pl. 20 from Small Book of Designs copy B, previously unrecorded. With Songs the Jovial Hinds Return from Plow, a preliminary drawing for one of the Virgil wood engravings, untraced since 1939.
           
1993: The First Book of Urizen, design only on pl. 3, probably from Small Book of Designs copy B, previously unrecorded. Commins, An Elegy Set to Music, a previously unrecorded copy.
           
1994: A Harper and Other Figure Studies, previously unknown pencil sketches on the verso of A Pastoral Figure and Other Sketches.

1995: Head of a Man, pencil sketch, previously unrecorded.
           
1996: Study for a Destroying Deity, pencil sketch, acquired by the Yale Center for British Art in 1977 but not identified as by Blake until 1996.
           
1997: The Marriage of Heaven and Hell copy M (pls.  25-27, “A Song of Liberty”), untraced since 1918. “Lucifer and the Pope  in Hell,” a previously unrecorded first state of the separate plate,  this impression with pencil additions for the second state. Blake’s  letter to George Cumberland, 1 Sept. 1800, previously unrecorded. Thenot and Colinet Seated beneath Two Trees and For Him Our Yearly Wakes and Feasts We Hold, two preliminary drawings for the Virgil wood engravings, untraced since 1939.
           
1998: Previously unrecorded copies of Blake’s prospectus  for “Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims” and R. H. Cromek’s first prospectus  of Nov. 1805 for his edition of Robert Blair, The Grave, listing Blake as the engraver of his designs. A complete copy of Designs to a Series of Ballads, Written by William Hayley (1802), untraced since 1944.

If this record has led us to expect new treasures  almost every year, 2011 did not disappoint. By early February I learned  that Bonhams in London would offer an unrecorded copy of Blake’s Poetical Sketches  (1783) in its 22 March auction. This adds one more copy to the  twenty-three previously traced and is only the third remaining in  private hands. [3] John  Windle, bidding on my behalf, was successful at a hammer price of  £60,000 (£72,000 including the buyer’s premium). He appears to have been  the only bidder against a reserve of £58,000; the estimate was  £60,000-80,000. See the second entry under First Editions of Blake’s Writings and illus. 4 and 5.

A person representing a descendant of Charles  Augustus Tulk (1786-1849), the Swedenborgian friend of Blake and John  Flaxman, contacted me in March about an album of drawings owned, and  probably assembled, by Tulk’s daughter Louisa Susanna in the first half  of the nineteenth century. Several British Blake scholars inspected the  album and found in it a watercolor and a pencil drawing definitely  attributable to Blake and a pen and ink drawing probably from his hand.  The watercolor and pencil drawing bear sketches by Blake on their  versos. The collection also includes several drawings by Flaxman. On the  basis of digital images supplied by the Tulk family’s representative,  I’m confident that these attributions are correct. None of these  materials has been previously recorded. The disposition of this  important discovery is still pending as of January 2012.

Grosvenor Prints of London offered two works with Blakean connections early in 2011. In March I found on its web site, http://www.grosvenorprints.com,  what is probably the earliest reproduction, previously unrecorded, of  Louis Schiavonetti’s engraving of Blake’s “Death’s Door” design for  Blair’s The Grave (see illus. 7).  While perusing the site in late April, I came upon a proof before  letters of a portrait engraving of George Romney. Might this possibly be  the print on which Blake was working in 1803-04, of which no other  impression is presently known? [4] An essay by Mark Crosby on this intriguing object is forthcoming in Blake.

A few days before Christmas, Nicholas Lott of  Larkhall Fine Art (Bath, England) informed me that he had just acquired a  previously unrecorded impression of pl. 15 from For Children: The Gates of Paradise; see the single entry under Illuminated Books. I hope to be able to say more about this print in next year’s report.

The auction season began auspiciously with the  sale of works of art and furnishings from the collection of the late  Charles Ryskamp at Sotheby’s New York on 25 January, “for the Primary  Benefit of Princeton University” (auction catalogue). Two leaves of  drawings by Blake in the collection were included. Interest in A Woman Enthroned  rests principally on an attempt to determine its subject and the way it  serves as a test for telling the difference between a very early work  by William Blake and one by his brother Robert. The pencil drawing The Lion Lying Down with the Ox  (catalogued as a verso in Butlin) is more impressive. The sketches on  the other side (the recto in Butlin) include preliminary details for  motifs appearing in America a Prophecy of 1793. These not only  help in dating both recto and verso but also offer evidence about how  Blake developed images for his illuminated books. See the listings under  Drawings and Paintings and illus. 1, 2, and 3.  The Ryskamp auction included nine lots of works by Blake’s circle and  followers, also listed below. Several lots that failed to find  purchasers at Sotheby’s were offered in June by Stair Auctions of  Hudson, New York, as recorded below.

John Windle, the San Francisco book and print  dealer, issued in early December another of his splendid catalogues  devoted to Blake. This most recent version, entitled “Pictorial Blake,”  features a number of engravings and etchings, as well as a good many  facsimiles of the illuminated books. Although some items in Windle’s  catalogue have been offered previously, all materials within the usual  purview of “Blake in the Marketplace” are listed below. This may be the  first catalogue to offer individual plates from Blake’s illustrations to  Edward Young’s Night Thoughts.

In 2000 I began to include Blake’s fellow  engraver and onetime business partner, James Parker (1750-1805), in  these annual sales reviews. This installment contains a survey of all  books known to contain Parker’s engravings on the market at the  beginning of 2011—a rather daunting list. I will not offer such thorough  coverage every year.

The year of all sales and catalogues in the  following lists is 2011 unless indicated otherwise. Most reports about  auction catalogues are based on the online versions. Coverage of  regional auctions is selective. Dates for dealers’ online catalogues are  the dates accessed, not the dates of publication. Works offered online  by dealers and previously listed in either of the last two sales reviews  are not repeated here. Most of the auction houses add their purchaser’s  surcharge to the hammer price in their price lists. These net amounts  are given here, following the official price lists. The value-added tax  levied against the buyer’s surcharge in Britain is not included. Late  2011 sales will be covered in the 2012 review. I am grateful for help in  compiling this review to Elizabeth Barker, G. E. Bentley, Jr., Mark  Crosby (particularly for assistance with women holding shields), Harriet  Drummond, Allison Galea, Ted Hofmann, Tim Linnell, Nicholas Lott,  Constance McPhee, Luana J. Nandan, Morton Paley, Steven Vest, Joseph  Viscomi, Angus Whitehead, and John Windle. My special thanks go to  Alexander Gourlay for help with Poetical Sketches and Landseer  prints, as well as his usual generosity in keeping me abreast of eBay  auctions. Once again, Sarah Jones’s editorial expertise and John  Sullivan’s electronic imaging have been invaluable.

First Editions of Blake’s Writings First Published in Letterpress in Blake’s Lifetime
         
Monthly Magazine, vol. 20, 1 Jan.  1806 issue only, and vol. 21, 1 Feb. through 1 July 1806 issues. Keogh’s  Books, Oct. online cat., uncut in contemporary boards worn, 7 distinct  sets of 3 stabholes from prior pamphlet-style binding of each monthly  issue, loss of spine at foot, printed spine label damaged, “21” printed  (from a stamp rather than in a press?) on the spine (£50). The 1 July  1806 issue, pp. 520-21, contains Blake’s letter to the editor defending  Fuseli’s painting of Count Ugolino (E 768-69). The original manuscript  letter is untraced. This copy of the magazine suggests that either the  publisher or another bookseller disbound unsold copies of individual  issues and rebound them as roughly half-year volumes in cheap  paper-covered boards.
         
Poetical Sketches,  1783. BHL, 22 March, #24, a previously unrecorded copy, binding, title  page, and pp. 14-15 illus. online (£72,000 to Windle acting for Essick).  Lacking the final blank leaf (K4), as in all but 7 copies, but  otherwise collated complete. [5]  Most leaves approx. 21.7 x 13.0 cm., leaf B1 narrower and leaves B4,  D1, D4, E1, F1-2, G2, I2-3, and K1 shorter. The shortness of 2 pairs of  leaves, D1,4 and I2-3, can be explained by imprecise placement of the  paper during printing, but I am not able to explain the other short  leaves based on the printing format. Laid paper without watermark, chain  lines 2.8 cm. apart, all leaves between 0.11 and 0.12 mm. thick. [6]  Some leaves appear to be uncut along their fore-edges, with evidence of  deckle along the fore-edges of the 1st and 2nd leaves of some  gatherings, although BB 345 records a larger leaf size of 22.3 x 13.9 cm. [7]  Leaf B4 pasted to a stub, G1 and I4 each with a round hole, 3.0 mm. and  4.0 mm. in diameter, touching letters (described in the auction cat. as  “paperflaw[s]” rather than later damage). Upper corner of the fore-edge  of B1 and lower corner of the fore-edge of F1 torn off, the latter  possibly during printing because of a paper flaw, neither affecting  text. Some scattered foxing and spotting, particularly on the 1st 2  leaves. Dust and damp staining on the title page (leaf [A1r]) suggest  that it was exposed without a cover for some years. Perhaps the final  leaf, blank K4, was similarly soiled on its verso; this may have been a  reason for its removal. Bound, probably in the 1st 3 decades of the 20th  century, in dark-blue crushed morocco, blue cloth place-mark ribbon,  marbled endpapers, 2 added flyleaves of off-white machine-made paper at  the front and 2 at the back, gilt-stamped ruled frame lines front, back,  and spine, the spine gilt stamped “POETICAL / SKETCHES / W. B. / 1783,”  the inside front cover gilt stamped lower right “BOUND BY WOOD,  LONDON.”           The stub for leaf B4, 1.0 mm. (head) to 5.0 mm. (tail) wide,  was made from the inner margin of the conjugate leaf, B1. This procedure  explains why B1 is narrower at the tail than at the head, which  corresponds inversely to the stub, wider at the tail than the head. B4  is not a cancellans or facsimile; it may have required pasting  to a stub because it became detached when a prior binding was removed  and the spine slightly shaved for rebinding.           BB 345 notes the presence of “facsimile pages,” some showing a “MICHALLET” watermark, in 5 copies of Poetical Sketches,  including whole gatherings H, I, and K (there is no J) in copies K, L,  and U, gatherings I and K in copy P, and the “Advertisement” (leaf [A2])  in copy Q. BBS 107 states that the “Advertisement” in copy P is also “in facsimile.” BB  points out that “the clearest indication of the facsimile [gatherings]  is in the last words on p. 59, where the penultimate ‘Prepare’ is under  the ‘w’ of ‘welcome’ in genuine copies and under the ‘c’ in the  facsimile” (345n1). The absence of the facsimile watermark and the  position of “Prepare” in this copy indicate that all gatherings are  genuine. Bentley describes other features distinguishing original leaves  from facsimiles in Blake 45.1 (summer 2011): 10. All leaves in  this copy meet these criteria for an original, including the presence  of the catchword (“THE”) on p. 59, the correct spelling of  “honest-seeming” on p. 65, and the absence of any significant  differences in paper thickness or the boldness of chain lines among  leaves.           Three leaves (I2, I4, K3) show 3 stabholes just outside the  gutter from a prior, pamphlet-style binding. These are 7.0 cm. from the  top margin and 4.4 cm. and 3.0 cm. apart. Leaves D3 and E2 show only the  top and bottom holes; C1-2, D2, D4, and F2 show only the top hole; H1  shows only the bottom hole. It is unusual for an octavo in half sheets  to have been bound in this fashion, since the gatherings can be sewn  through their inner folds. Blake’s wife, Catherine, apparently bound her  husband’s illuminated books pamphlet-style, stabbed through the leaves  within the left margin rather than sewn through the folds. [8]  Thus, the stabholes may be remnants of the book’s original binding  produced by Catherine. The absence of any evidence of this stabbing on  most leaves is probably due to the rebinding of the holes into the  book’s gutter. The present binding may have been produced by Harry Wood,  active in London in the 1890s, or (more probably) by the successor firm  continued by Henry Thomas Wood that operated under the name H. T. Wood  from 1900 to the early 1930s. See Maurice Packer, Bookbinders of Victorian London (London: British Library, 1991) 166, and Mirjam M. Foot, Studies in the History of Bookbinding (Aldershot: Scolar P, 1993) 74.           For the title page, its inscriptions, and the book’s provenance, see illus. 4 and its caption.

Virgil, later impressions of Blake’s wood  engravings printed by or for the Linnell family. Larkhall Fine Art, Aug.  private offer, 21 impressions of BB #504.8 (Blake’s 4th wood engraving), 14 impressions of BB  #504.13 (Blake’s 9th wood engraving), all printed on thin paper laid  onto wove paper backing leaves, with an envelope inscribed in pencil by  John Linnell, Jr.: “Pastorals / 5 impressions—of the blocks / as samples  for average strength [printing pressure?] / J. Linnell May 1892 / to be  returned” (£650 each). According to Nicholas Lott of Larkhall, these  impressions are “well printed and show some considerable detail compared  to many rather heavy over-inked Linnell printings.” John Linnell, Sr.,  acquired the blocks in 1825. According to John Linnell, Jr., some  impressions were printed for his father by Edward Calvert (I suspect  shortly after acquiring the blocks) and “J. L. jun. and brother  printed a few of the blocks, but did not finish the set” (BB  630, quoting from a manuscript “List of John Linnell Senior’s Letters  and Papers” in the Ivimy Archive now in the Fitzwilliam Museum). The  Larkhall impressions are apparently from that later printing (or series  of printings), no later than 1892, by J. L., Jr., and one of his  brothers. Windle, Dec. “Pictorial Blake” cat., #79, “fifth cut”  (actually Blake’s 6th wood engraving), Linnell impression, accompanying a  copy of Essick and Windle, A Troubled Paradise (1999), no. 4  of 13 copies thus, publisher’s wrappers and folding cloth box, illus.

John Price, Jan. online cat., contemporary sheep rebacked, corners  restored (£660). For the Bodleian Library copy with Blake’s annotations,  see Philip J. Cardinale and Joseph R. Cardinale, “A Newly Discovered  Blake Book: William Blake’s Copy of Thomas Taylor’s The Mystical Initiations; or, Hymns of Orpheus (1787),” Blake 44.3 (winter 2010-11): 84-102.
         
E. Swedenborg, Wisdom of Angels, Concerning Divine Love and Divine Wisdom,  1788. Antiquaria Bok, July online cat., contemporary half calf worn  ($806). The final 3 lines of text on the title page are “PRINTED AND  SOLD BY W. CHALKLEN, GROCERS COURT, / POULTRY. / M.DCC.LXXXVIII.” The  transcription in BB #742 omits “AND SOLD” and the line break before “POULTRY.” Blake’s copy in the British Library is available in Eighteenth Century Collections Online http://find.galegroup.com/ecco, but his annotations are mostly illegible.
         
T. Butts, signature. BHL, 7 June, #20,  commissions issued by George III and George IV to George Collard of the  Royal East India Company Volunteers, 1798-1820, including a document of  17 Oct. 1805 countersigned by Blake’s patron Thomas Butts “in his  capacity as joint chief clerk in the office of the Commissary General of  Musters,” illus. (not sold; estimate £400-600); same group of  documents, BHO, 27 Sept., #15, illus. (£400). According to the auction  cats., the signature reads “Entered with the Commissary General of  Musters / Tho: Butts.”
         
T. Butts, “Man on a Drinking Horse.” Etched by  Butts (father and/or son), 1806, possibly with Blake’s assistance. EB,  March-April, c. 1942 printing, illus. ($50). For illus. and information  about this print, see Alexander S. Gourlay, “‘Man on a Drinking Horse’: A  Print by Thomas Butts, Jr.,” Blake 37.1 (summer 2003): 35-36.
         
L. Schiavonetti, a letter mentioning his engraving of Blake’s portrait for Blair’s Grave,  1808. BHL, 29 March, #326, 3 undated letters, 1 stating “I wish to know  whether it would make any material difference was I to execute it [a  portrait of Lord Grey] in a free line manner similar to Blake’s Portrait  for Mr Cromek …,” 5 pp. in all, postmarked 1803-10 (£180). Apparently  not the same as the letter by Schiavonetti, also referring to the  engraving of Blake’s portrait, dated 30 Jan. 1810 to Messrs. Cadell and  Davies, offered by Nicholas Lott, May 2003 (£300).
         
Blake, “Death’s Door,” an etched copy, dated 1820, of Schiavonetti’s pl. for Blair’s Grave (1808), showing only the old man entering the tomb. Grosvenor Prints, March online cat., illus. (£140). See illus. 7.


7. “Death’s Door,” an etched copy of Blake’s design. … [+]



         
“Interior of the Sessions House, Old Bailey,”  etching/engraving so inscribed and signed lower right “Blake del et sc.”  in the pl., image 10.6 x 16.3 cm. Grosvenor Prints, Sept. online cat.,  dated to “c. 1820” but possibly earlier given the graphic style and  costumes of the figures, illus. (£95). I very much doubt that this  awkward and amateurish print was executed by Blake the artist and poet.
         
J. Linnell, children of. An album of drawings  and watercolors, probably dating from the 1830s, by the children of  Blake’s patron John Linnell. The collection includes charmingly juvenile  watercolor copies of pls. from Blake’s Songs of Innocence, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, and For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise, the coloring of the children’s own invention. Acquired Aug. by a British private collector.
         
The Child’s Gem. A Holiday Gift. Ed.  Mrs. S. Colman. Boston: T. H. Carter and Company, “1844” (actually 1843,  the copyright date). EB, Nov., scattered foxing and browning,  publisher’s cloth worn, illus. (offered at the “buy it now” price of  $50). Includes, pp. 85-88, Blake’s “The Chimney Sweeper” from Songs of Innocence, with Blake’s long lines changed to 2 lines each, with a tailpiece of a child playing a tambourine. Not in BB or BBS.  For other publications by Colman containing Blake’s poems, see Raymond  H. Deck, Jr., “An American Original: Mrs. Colman’s Illustrated Printings  of Blake’s Poems, 1843-44,” Blake 11.1 (summer 1977): 4-18.
         
Nightingale Valley, ed. “Giraldus” (William Allingham), 1860 (BB #264). Jarndyce, Dec. 2010 online “Christmas” cat., no entry #, publisher’s cloth (£180). Includes 4 poems from Blake’s Songs of Innocence and of Experience.  In a note, Allingham explains that “it remains to add that for the  version of ‘The Tiger,’ here presented [95-96], differing somewhat from  those hitherto published, use has been made of a MS. book of Blake’s,  belonging to a friend of the editor, full of the oddest chaos of verses,  drawings, and memoranda” (275-76). The “friend” was Dante Gabriel  Rossetti and the “MS. book” was Blake’s Notebook. Allingham’s version is  based loosely on drafts on pp. 108-09 of the Notebook, with punctuation  added, spelling changed, and lines 15-18, 21-24 of the etched version  omitted. He also made 2 substantive but unauthorized revisions, “ardour”  for “fire” in the 2nd stanza (“Burnt the fire of thine eyes?” E 24) and  “God” for “he” in the 4th (“Did he smile his work to see?” E 25).  Allingham’s final line in the 3rd stanza (“What dread hand form’d thy  dread feet?”) follows Blake’s manuscript revision in copy P of Songs of Innocence and of Experience  (see E 794). The ownership of copy P (now Getty Collection, Wormsley  Library, Buckinghamshire) between 1855 and 1931 is unknown. Allingham’s  notebook with transcriptions of poems from Blake’s Notebook is in the  Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand; see D. F. McKenzie, “William  Allingham’s Notebook of Poems by Blake,” Turnbull Library Record 1.3 (March 1968): 9-11. My comments here correct and supplement my statements in Blake 34.4 (spring 2001): 110.

W. Blake, Little Tom the Sailor, Muir  facsimile, 1886. EB, Jan., the leaf showing part of the countermark of  the laid paper with a “DICKINSON” watermark used for impressions  published in Century Guild Hobby Horse 1.4 (Oct. 1886), illus.  (£205). All copies I have seen that were issued in the journal were  folded at least twice. This example, with a single central fold, may not  have been published in the Hobby Horse. The vendor provided an  image of the countermark in response to my inquiry but did not indicate  in his EB description that this is a lithographic reproduction. Some  bidders may have believed it to be an original impression even though  the vendor did not explicitly make that claim. Windle, Feb. cat. 48,  #30, leaf 55.9 x 22.9 cm. “folded thrice, with stab holes in the  margin,” from the Hobby Horse, illus. ($750).

“Mrs Q,” Blake after Villiers, the  lithographic facsimile of 1906. EB, Oct., version on laid paper with  color printing in green on the foliage right of the figure, illus.  (£52). This very convincing facsimile, offered on EB as an original, was  printed on wove paper when published in Mrs. Q—and “Windsor Castle” with a Note on the Plates by Joseph Grego (London: Kegan Paul, 1906). All original impressions I have seen are on wove paper.

Blake, Songs of Innocence and of  Experience: Sixteen Designs Printed from Electrotypes of the Original  Plates for Ruthven Todd and Geoffrey Keynes, 1941. Maggs, March  cat. 1446, #99, loose in paper folder as issued, 1 of 20 sets, inscribed  by Keynes to Douglas Cleverdon (£80 to Windle for stock; acquired April  by Victoria University Library, Toronto). The only copy I’ve seen on  the market since 1972.
         
Blake, Gerusalemme: L’ Emanazione del gigante Albione. Trans. Giuseppe Ungaretti. Milan: Fratelli Bocca Editori, 1943 (BBS  88). EB, March, publisher’s wrappers, illus. (offered at the “buy it  now” price of €19.90). It is remarkable that a complete translation of  Blake’s epic would be published in Italy in 1943, a year in which the  country fell into chaos as it was being invaded from the south by the  British and Americans and from the north by the Germans. Ungaretti  (1888-1970) was an important figure in 20th-century Italian literature  and a supporter of Mussolini. Perhaps the translator’s connections with  the fascist government, before its fall in July 1943, gave him special  access to publishers and printers.

Appendix: New Information on Blake’s Engravings
 				
Listed below are substantive additions or corrections to Essick, William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations (1991).
 				
Pp. 39-40, Fenning and Collyer, A New System of Geography,  1785-86, 1787. Copies of the 1785-86 issue in the Essick collection and  in the Morris Miller Library, University of Tasmania, Hobart, include a  previously unrecorded 2nd st. of pl. 1 in which the imprint is dated  “July 16.th 1785” followed by a semi-colon. [10] In the 1st st. (British Library), the date is “June 6.th 1784” followed by a semi-colon. In the 3rd (previously 2nd) and final st., the imprint is dated “July 16.th  1787” followed by a comma. The attribution of this unsigned pl. to  Blake as the engraver and Stothard as the designer is based only on a  pencil inscription (by Robert Balmanno?) on a proof of the central  design in the British Museum. Pl. 2 in the Essick copy of the 1785-86  issue is in the 2nd st., with a 1787 imprint, previously recorded only  in copies of the 1787 issue. BB #455A lists only the British Library (designated “BM”) copy  of the 1785-86 issue; copies of the 1787 issue are in the Explorers  Club, New York (BB #455B), and in the University of Reading Library (BBS 213). As CB  fig. 57 shows, Blake’s pl. 1 in the British Library copy is torn and  abraded lower left. The copy of the 1785-86 issue in the Morris Miller  Library is badly damaged by water; many leaves are stuck together and  only part of Blake’s pl. 2 is visible. The University of Minnesota  online library cat. does not list the 1787 issue located there by BBS  213. According to its online cat., a copy of the 1787 issue is in the  Hennepin County Library, Minnetonka, Minnesota. For an illus. of and  comments on Blake’s pl. 2, see Blake 36.4 (spring 2003): 124. A complete reproduction of the British Library copy of the 1785-86 issue is available on Eighteenth Century Collections Online http://find.galegroup.com/ecco.
 				
Pp. 41-42, Lavater, Essays on Physiognomy.  In the original issue of the work in parts, Blake’s pl. 1 was included  in part 5, dated July 1788 on the printed back wrapper. The pl. is  listed on the front wrapper as “7. aged figures, gardening.” Blake’s pl. 2 was issued in part 3, dated May 1788, and is listed on the front wrapper as “7. democritus, finished.”
 				
Pp. 45-49, Darwin, Botanic Garden, 1st ed. of Part 1, 1791. For a copy that includes Blake’s pl. 6 of 1795, see the final entry on Darwin under Letterpress Books with Engravings by and after Blake, above. 
 				
P. 101, Flaxman, Compositions from the Works Days and Theogony of Hesiod,  1817. The complete set of prepublication proofs at the Bodleian  Library, unseen at the time of writing, has now been listed on the  Bodleian’s online cat. (http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk,  accessed 1 Nov. 2011). These are described as “37 proofs, of which 27  are before letters,” call number Arch. AA b.15, Aleph system number  013996444.
 				
Corrigendum
 				
In my 2010 review I noted “a Small Etching”  attributed to Blake, “representing Sampson destroying the Lion,” offered  by A. E. Evans and Son in an 1845 cat. (Blake 44.4 [spring  2011]: 129). This is almost certainly the impression of “Samson and the  Lion,” an etching by Welby Sherman, inscribed “WS / 1827” and acquired  by the British Museum in 1847, accession no. 1847,0318.122. According to  Campbell Dodgson, “The Engravings of George Richmond, R.A., and Welby  Sherman,” Print Collector’s Quarterly 17.4 (Oct. 1930): 361,  the museum’s impression was “bought as ‘an etching by Blake.’” Dodgson  was keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum, 1912-32.

         
 
       
Notes           
1. This list is selective and based mainly on the annual installments of “Blake in the Marketplace” published in Blake.  Posthumous impressions of Blake’s relief etchings and impressions of  his more common separate plates, such as “Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims,”  are not included. Only the rarest books with Blake’s commercial  engravings are listed. In most cases, discoveries are recorded for the  year they were published or became generally known.
           
2. The ownership of  copy M remains unknown, but its existence in a private collection was  reported by Ursus Rare Books, New York, in April 2009; see Blake 43.4 (spring 2010): 120.
           
3. See BB #128. Copy E, located by BBS 107 in the possession of “a private American Collector,” has been in the collection of Alan Parker, London, since Jan. 2007; see Blake 41.4 (spring 2008): 147. For copy M, listed as untraced in BB, see note 2, above. G. E. Bentley, Jr., “William Blake and His Circle: A Checklist of Publications and Discoveries in 2003,” Blake  38.1 (summer 2004): 11, suspects that “Copy Q?” might be the copy  evaluated by Ursus Books, New York, in 2003. That is very probably copy  M; copy Q has been in the Preston Blake Collection, City of Westminster  Archives Centre (formerly Westminster Public Library), since 1966 (as  recorded in BB 352). Geoffrey Keynes speculates that about fifty copies of Poetical Sketches may have been printed; see Keynes, Blake Studies, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1971) 34.
           
4. See the references to Blake’s execution of this plate in letters by Hayley and Blake, BR(2) 157 and E 736, 739, 744, 753, 757, 760. The portrait was intended as an illustration for Hayley’s Life of George Romney, but was not included in the book when published in 1809.
           
5. BB 343 describes the book as “4o (half sheet imposition): [A1-2], B-K4 (J omitted);  signed on first two leaves of each quire except in quire A.” The leaves  are signed and gathered in 4s, but the printing format is more properly  described as an octavo (8o) in 4s, half-sheet imposition. For this format, see Philip Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography  (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1972) figs. 52 (half sheets of octavo worked  together) and 53 (half sheet of octavo imposed for work and turn). In a  quarto (4o) in half sheets (Gaskell figs. 48 and 49), the  chain lines run horizontally; in an octavo in half sheets they run  vertically, as in Poetical Sketches.
           
6. The leaves of  copy C are the same thickness; those in copy S range between 0.09 and  0.11 mm. (both Huntington Library). These slight variations—at most 3  hundredths of a millimeter—within and among copies are to be expected in  handmade paper.
           
7.  Geoffrey Keynes, A Bibliography of William Blake  (New York: Grolier Club, 1921) 77, notes an even larger leaf size, “23 x  14 cm., uncut.” A completely uncut copy of a book printed as an octavo  in half sheets will show deckle along the fore-edges of the 1st and 2nd  leaves of each gathering in 4s and along the foot of every leaf. This  copy of Poetical Sketches appears to have been trimmed slightly along the foot; only D2 shows evidence of deckle at its foot.
           
8. See BB  54-56 for a list of Blake’s books stabbed in this manner. The  illuminated books were “done up [that is, bound] … by Mrs. Blake’s  hand,” according to Alexander Gilchrist, Life of William Blake,  vol. 1 (London: Macmillan, 1863) 70. Many of the illuminated books were  printed on single leaves, and thus there were no folds through which to  sew.
           
9. Jefferys was much  influenced by Mortimer, Barry, and Fuseli. See Martin Butlin, “The  Rediscovery of an Artist: James Jefferys 1751-1784,” Blake 10.4 (spring 1977): 123-24.
           
10. I am grateful  to Luana J. Nandan of the Morris Miller Library for all information  about the copy in that collection (e-mail, 16 March 2011).

1. Sketches for “America” and Other Books. Pencil on wove paper, leaf 20.5 x 26.7 cm. Butlin #226 recto. The pencil numbers (“c – 2” on the arm center right, the same top right corner, and “2” in a circle top left corner) are not by Blake. Essick collection. For the verso of this leaf, see illus. 2.
 				
As Butlin indicates, several of these sketches relate to America a Prophecy and thus can be dated to 1793, the year that illuminated book is dated on its title page, or to late 1792. In the drawings that probably served as direct preliminaries, right and left are the reverse of the etched motifs in impressions of America pls. and thus these drawings have the same orientation as the images on the copperplates. This is what we generally find with preliminary sketches for Blake’s relief etchings, whereas the drawings for his white-line etchings, such as Sketch for “Jerusalem,” Plate 26: Hand Appearing to Jerusalem (Butlin #566), were transferred face down onto the copperplates and thus have the same right/left orientation as impressions.
 				
The rising male with short chains dangling from him is clearly the preliminary drawing for the figure upper left in America pl. 5. The running female with right arm raised (top left corner in the drawing) appears lower left on the same pl. Light pencil lines indicate that Blake (first?) drew this figure’s head further to the right, her raised right arm further to the left, and her right leg in a slightly lower position. The hand and arm near the center of the sheet are very close to the right hand and arm of Urizen on America pl. 10 and to the left arm and hand of Orc on pl. 12. Butlin relates the slight sketch of the figure top right to the soaring female upper right on the America title page, but the association is rather loose because of differences in leg position. In the drawing, the figure appears to have 3 legs, probably because Blake is experimenting with different positions for her limbs. The pencil lines delineating this figure and the 2 long vertical lines to the left, possibly the trunk of a tree with a limb arching downwards on its left side (the limb curves downwards above the highest leg and foot, terminating just left of the foot), are much lighter than other lines on this side of the leaf—and less carefully executed. It is tempting to suspect that these light-line motifs were created with a different pencil, perhaps at an earlier date.
 				
The 2 studies of bent legs, lower left, are similar to the legs of the seated youth on America pl. 8, in turn a repetition of the man on The Marriage of Heaven and Hell pl. 21. As Butlin points out, these have the same right/left directions as in impressions. For that reason, I suspect that they were not direct preliminaries for either of the relief etchings. If the legs predate The Marriage of 1790, then they were very probably executed before the America sketch of the rising figure with chains. Their position on the leaf, however, suggests that they were drawn after (although perhaps immediately after) motifs closer to the center of the paper. A sketch of a lower right leg and foot, above and to the right of the lower of the 2 drawings of bent legs, may be related to this group of leg studies.
 				
Butlin associates the 3 studies of arms with fists, lower right, with the man clenching his head lower right on America pl. 6, but here again the drawings are not direct preliminaries. The pair of feet extending below the hem of a gown, carefully drawn just right of the base of the tree, may be a precursor to the single visible foot of the gowned man in Europe pl. 11. The other studies of feet are similar to a good many in the illuminated books of 1790-94, but these relationships are probably generic. Taken together, the drawings on this leaf suggest that they may not have been executed with a particular image in America (or any other illuminated book) in mind. Rather, all were executed as first thoughts on paper and as a way of assembling a pictorial vocabulary of anatomical and gestural forms for future use, whenever and wherever such use became appropriate in Blake’s estimation. When he borrowed from this image bank, he sometimes repeated a motif with little alteration, executing it with acid-resistant varnish on a copperplate much as he had done earlier with pencil on paper. In other instances, he modified the image considerably, its repetition thereby evolving into a reinvention. Perhaps neither procedure necessitated a literal return to these sketches, the stock of motifs they represent having been internalized.

8. John Flaxman. “Antigone Forced from Her Father,” an illus. to Sophocles, Oedipus at Colonus. Lithograph by Maria Denman, signed lower left “Drawn on Stone by Maria Denman, from a Sketch by John Flaxman Esq.r R.A.” and dated May 1827 in the imprint. Design within framing lines 9.5 x 16.0 cm., image including inscriptions 11.2 x 16.0 cm., leaf of wove paper 19.0 x 28.3 cm. showing part of a J Wha[tman] / 18[?] watermark. Essick collection. Oedipus clings to his daughter as 2 of Creon’s guards drag her away. Flaxman’s wash drawing of the design, 9.1 x 15.8 cm., is in the British Museum, accession no. 1888,0503.34. The only other impression of Denman’s print that I’ve been able to locate is also in the British Museum and is inscribed in pencil “The original drawing was bought by me at the Denman sale in 1862.” Denman was Flaxman’s sister-in-law and the copublisher of his Aeschylus and Acts of Mercy designs in 1831. Her drawing of Thomas Hayley’s portrait medallion of Romney was engraved by Caroline Watson and published in William Hayley’s Life of George Romney (1809).

9. George Richmond. Dawn. Oil on panel, 35.0 x 40.7 cm., inscribed on the back “The moon is up. I have not / heard the clock. and she / goes down at twelve. / G. Richmond.” The absence of human figures and the loose, painterly, and atmospheric style are unusual for Richmond; the work would probably not be attributable to him without the verso inscription. Possibly datable to the late 1820s or early 1830s when Richmond, Palmer, and others among Blake’s youthful followers were interested in moonlit scenes. “Their motto was ‘Poetry and Sentiment’, and at night they rambled over the nearby countryside by moonlight or in thunderstorms, or sat on campstools in the open air, reciting poetry to one another, and sometimes acting scenes from Macbeth” (Raymond Lister, George Richmond: A Critical Biography [London: Robin Garton, 1982] 15). The inscription on the painting, quoted here from the CSK cat. of 16 March, is from the beginning of act 2, scene 1, of Macbeth, with “the moon is down” changed to “the moon is up.” The 1st 10 words are spoken by Fleance, the remainder by Banquo. Richmond’s engraving of 1827, “The Fatal Bellman,” includes an inscription from Macbeth, act 2, scene 2: “It was the owl that shriek’d, the fatal bell-man.” Lister mentions “a drawing” by Richmond “of Lady Macbeth of about 1825” (124).

7. “Death’s Door,” an etched copy of Blake’s design. Inscribed in drypoint below the design, “E .. L .. sculp .. July 18th 1820” (the dot under the “t” of “th” is a paper stain, not a period). Image (including inscription) 14.1 x 10.7 cm., platemark 15.0 x 11.9 cm., on India paper laid onto a leaf of wove paper, 23.0 x 18.7 cm., without watermark. Essick collection.
 				
This skilled etching is based on Louis Schiavonetti’s etching/engraving of “Death’s Door,” first published in R. H. Cromek’s 1808 ed. of Robert Blair’s The Grave and reprinted in R. Ackermann’s 1813 ed. of the poem. Much of the image follows Schiavonetti’s work line for line; only the shading below the threshold lower left is configured differently. The motifs in this etching are the same size as those in Schiavonetti’s pl., but the pl. reproduced here excludes the youth rising above the tomb, the rugged rocks surrounding its sides and top, and the plants lower right. A tracing of Schiavonetti’s pl. may have been transferred face down onto the etching ground for this close copy.
 				
There are several reasons for believing that “E .. L ..” is the great Victorian animal painter Sir Edwin Henry Landseer (1802-73). He was a child prodigy in the arts, producing his first etching at age 7, exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1815, and entering the R. A. schools a year later. In 1824, Landseer signed 2 of his etchings of animals, titled “The Beggar” and “The Common in Winter,” with his initials. In both, the 2 letters are connected, but the rounded shapes of the letters and their beginning and ending flourishes are similar to the initials in this “Death’s Door” etching. In his 1825 etching “Deerhounds’ Heads,” the initials are separate and close to the letter forms we see in “Death’s Door.” The etching style in the animal prints is freer and more expressive than in “Death’s Door,” but that is to be expected in compositions of an artist’s own invention rather than a reproductive work.
 				
Landseer very probably learned to etch from his father, John George Landseer (1763/9-1852), a professional printmaker “who was extremely ambitious for his children” (ODNB) and instructed them in the arts. His Lectures on the Art of Engraving (1807) treats some of the same topics as Blake’s writings on that subject (see Essick, William Blake Printmaker [Princeton: Princeton UP, 1980] 198-99). Edwin was probably introduced to Blake’s Grave designs by his father. The “List of Subscribers” printed in the 1808 Grave includes “John Landseer, Esq. F. A. S. Engraver to the King” (2nd p. of the list, unpaginated). Thus, a copy of the book may well have been in the Landseer family home in 1820. John Landseer praises Schiavonetti in his 1807 Lectures (304-05) and, in his Descriptive, Explanatory, and Critical, Catalogue of Fifty of the Earliest Pictures Contained in the National Gallery of Great Britain (1834), alludes to Blake’s title-page design for The Grave (see Blake 44.4 [spring 2011]: 125). Perhaps copying “Death’s Door” was assigned to the son by the father as part of the young man’s training as an etcher.
 				
Another possible source for Edwin Landseer’s knowledge about Blake is Henry Fuseli, keeper at the R. A. when Edwin attended its schools. He “attracted Fuseli’s attention by his talents and gentle manner” and was called “my little dog boy” by Fuseli; see Charles Robert Leslie, Autobiographical Recollections, ed. Tom Taylor (London: John Murray, 1860) 1: 39. According to Richard Ormond, Sir Edwin Landseer (London: Thames and Hudson, 1982) 43, Landseer “admired Henry Fuseli and William Blake.”
 				
Information about Landseer given here is based on the biography in the ODNB by Judith Bronkhurst and Richard Ormond and on Frederick G. Stephens, Sir Edwin Landseer (London: Sampson Low, 1880). The latter includes reproductions of a few of Landseer’s early etchings. He is the only etcher/engraver with the initials E. L. and active c. 1820 listed in Raymond Lister, Prints and Printmaking: A Dictionary and Handbook of the Art in Nineteenth-Century Britain (London: Methuen, 1984). I am grateful to Alexander Gourlay for suggesting that this print may be by Landseer.

6. John Linnell. Manuscript draft of an advertisement for Blake’s Job engravings, datable to 1825-26. Pen and ink on wove paper, 22.7 x 18.4 cm. with a John Hall watermark just within the left edge. Acquired Sept. by Essick from John Windle. Transcription: “Blake’s Illustrations / of the / Book of Job . / Consisting of 22 Plates engraved by himself upon / Copper from his own Designs / Price to subscribers - - - 3 . 3 - / Proofs on India paper  5 - 5 - / Subscriptions—  1 . - / received by the Author Wm Blake .3 Fountain Court / Strand / or M.r J. Linnell 6. Cirencester Place Fitzroy sq[uare]- / These Plates are engraved entirely by Mr Blake with the / graver only (that is without the aid of Aqua fortis).” These prices accord with most of those listed in Linnell’s Job accounts; see BR(2) 799-807. The concluding statement is very similar to a note by Linnell among the Ivimy manuscripts, now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, that the Job pls. were “cut with the graver entirely on copper without the aid of Aqua fortis” (BR[2] 318fn). I am confident that Linnell, a skilled printmaker who commissioned the Job engravings and was intimately involved in their production and distribution, is correct on this matter except for preliminary drypoint sketching of the border designs and inscriptions. For a contrary opinion, see Mei-Ying Sung, William Blake and the Art of Engraving (London: Pickering and Chatto, 2009) 112.
 
The draft advertisement is pasted to a backing leaf of wove paper, 38.4 x 26.4 cm., formerly bound into a complete copy of the Job engravings. A copy of the printed Job label is pasted to the same leaf above Linnell’s manuscript. The pencil inscription just above the lower edge of the latter, “preserve this,” also appears on the label. Neither was written by Linnell. Also previously bound into the same copy of Blake’s engravings was a dark-brown wove paper wrapper, 38.0 x 24.5 cm., cut into 3 pieces—front cover, back cover, spine—now also in Essick’s collection. The front cover is inscribed in ink, “BLAKE’S / ILLUSTRATIONS of the / Book of Job / [rule] / unfinished Proofs.” The final line is in Linnell’s hand; he probably also wrote the block letters of the first 3 lines. Since the Job pls. with which these materials were bound are published “Proof” impressions, not “unfinished” proofs, the wrapper was apparently designed for, and possibly once bound with, a different copy.
 
The “John Hall” watermark is identical to the 1st line of a mark appearing in Jane Austen’s letter of 2 Dec. 1815 to her sister Cassandra (Morgan Library and Museum, New York, accession no. 977.40). A 2nd line of the letter’s watermark is “1814”; any such second line would have been trimmed off the leaf bearing Linnell’s manuscript. Hall produced paper at Cotton Mill, Ringstead, Northamptonshire; see http://www.themorgan.org/collections/conservation/austen/watermarks.asp, accessed 3 Sept. 2011.

2. The Lion Lying Down with the Ox. Pencil on wove paper, leaf 20.5 x 26.7 cm. Butlin #226 verso. Essick collection. For the recto drawings, see illus. 1.
 				
Geoffrey Keynes offers an interesting reading of this vigorous, and evidently symbolic, sketch in Drawings of William Blake: 92 Pencil Studies (New York: Dover, 1970), caption to illus. 5. He associates the drawing with a line from Blake’s Tiriel, “Why is one law given to the lion and the patient Ox” (E 285), and states that “it is clearly a tentative idea for an illustration” to that poem of c. 1789. Although the object held by the hunched-over old man in the background is probably a shepherd’s crook, Keynes describes it as a whip, the instrument by which this Urizenic figure enforces “one law” for all. Butlin modifies this interpretation in several important respects. He dates the drawing to c. 1790-95, largely for stylistic reasons, notes the similarities, in sensibility and possibly in iconography, to America pl. 9 of 1793, and points out that Blake used a revised version of the line from Tiriel in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell of 1790: “One Law for the Lion and Ox is Oppression” (E 44).
 				
As Keynes suggests, the youthful male lying on the lion may be holding and reading a book; the standing (prepubescent?) female holds a lyre in her extended right hand. The foreground creatures may be the inhabitants of a peaceable kingdom where harmony resides between the lion and the ox, humans and animals, male and female, music and the written word. The design thus accords with Isaiah 11:6-7, a millenarian vision of a time when “the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb … and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.” Given this perspective, the old man can be viewed as a threat emerging into this Edenic state rather than a sign of its present condition. He may be a priest, the shepherd of a human flock. His blankly staring eyes may be blind, or at least incapable of imaginative visions such as the one in front of him. The lightly sketched rectilinear forms around him, perhaps representing a portal through which this figure has entered the scene, reinforce his contracted posture and contrast with the curving lineaments of life. Even if he holds a crook rather than a whip, the rod still suggests imposed control in the hand of a menacing counterpart to the benign shepherds in Blake’s art and poetry.
 				
Another textual analogue for the drawing’s major motifs, probably composed at about the same time as this drawing and its recto sketches, can be found among Bromion’s questions in Visions of the Daughters of Albion (1793):
 
And are there other joys, beside the joys of riches and ease? And is there not one law for both the lion and the ox? And is there not eternal fire, and eternal chains? To bind the phantoms of existence from eternal life? (E 48)
 
The foreground in the drawing offers a positive contrary to Bromion’s negative rhetoric and perspective: there are “joys” other than “riches and ease,” the lion and ox need not be harnessed to the same law to reside in peace, and such visions are not mere “phantoms.” Unfortunately, the old man may soon “bind” the varieties of “eternal life” and art with the mind-forged “chains” of “one law.” Like Bromion and like the bespectacled and purblind personification of “Aged Ignorance” with his giant scissors on pl. 13 of For Children: The Gates of Paradise (1793), the ominous shepherd will destroy what he can neither perceive nor understand.
 				
Blake began by drawing the head of the boy atop the lion further to the right and his left leg a bit higher on the leaf. A circle in light pencil above the shepherd’s head suggests that Blake first drew the figure in a slightly higher position. Other sketchy lines above him may be alternative positions for a smaller portal. Two sets of very light lines right of the doorway might be background trees.
 				
For an interpretation of the design as picturing a “false paradise” already under the dominion of one law, see David Bindman, Blake as an Artist (Oxford: Phaidon, 1977) 47. He notes the similarities among this drawing, Blake’s A Pastoral Scene of the early 1780s (Butlin #142), and the sketches (perhaps in part by Robert Blake) on the back of the Island in the Moon manuscript of c. 1784 (Butlin #149). Bindman’s interpretation gains credibility if we view the languid postures of both youths and the fact that the girl is not playing the lyre as indications of an enervated state.

4. Poetical Sketches, title page, leaf 21.8 x 12.7 cm. with a ragged fore-edge and other evidence of flaws in the paper upper right. Essick collection, acquired at BHL, 22 March, #24. With the following pen and brown ink inscriptions: “lake” added following Blake’s initials printed on the title page to spell out his last name, “at Mr Taylors / Green St. Leicester fields” below the ruled line following “By W. B.,” and “Paulum sepulta distat inertiæ / celata virtus” in the lower margin. The dot of the “i” is so far displaced to the right in “Leicester” and “fields” that they appear to be misspellings, “Leicister” (with no dot over the first “i”) and “feilds.” Copy S of Poetical Sketches (Huntington Library) also has “lake” added, but in pencil.
 				
The online auction cat. initially attributed “lake” and “at Mr Taylors …” to Blake, but this was met with less than universal assent. On the basis of digital images, G. E. Bentley, Jr., Alexander Gourlay, and Joseph Viscomi rejected the attribution by Bonhams. Ted Hofmann, senior specialist in English books at Quaritch, the venerable antiquarian bookshop, inspected the original. He did not believe that “lake” was written by Blake and found that “the very round ‘k’ seems quite impossible” (e-mail, 9 March 2011). When informed of these views, Bonhams added the following “Lot Notice” to its online cat. on 11 March: “The consensus of several scholarly oppinions [sic] is that the inscriptions on the title are not in the hand of William Blake.”
 				
Cataloguers at Bonhams may have been led to their attribution by similarities between the “at Mr Taylors …” inscription and Blake’s hand in the manuscript of An Island in the Moon, generally dated to c. 1784-85. The stroking—that is, the sequence of directions in which the pen was moved to write the letters—is the same. The enlarged form of a lowercase “g,” used as a capital in “Green,” is the same in its upper elements as we see in the Island manuscript, including “Gimblet” and “Gass” on the first leaf (see the William Blake Archive http://www.blakearchive.org.libproxy.lib.unc.edu, object 1, lines 11 and 19). Gourlay, however, finds that the loop to the left of the descender of the “G” on the title page is a significant difference from examples in the Island manuscript, all of which show that Blake lifted his pen when drawing it back from the termination of the descender (e-mail, 8 March 2011). The paucity of looping verticals in examples of Blake’s handwriting, both formal and informal, is also crucial for Viscomi.
 				
The Bonhams cat. claims that the Latin was inscribed by a hand different from the one that wrote the other inscriptions on the title page. Gourlay, Viscomi, and I believe that all 3 inscriptions are by the same hand, possibly writing at different times (e-mails, 12 May 2011). The ink color is the same, although “lake” may have been written with a wider nib. The auction cat. points out that the Latin is a quotation from “Horace’s Odes.” The passage appears in book 4, ode 9, lines 29-30, which can be roughly translated as “when courage lies hidden, it is little better than shame hushed up in the grave.” In lines just before those quoted, Horace states that brave men remain unknown unless their deeds are sung by poets. The relevance of the quotation to Blake and his poetry may be multiple. Several of the Poetical Sketches, including “A War Song to Englishmen” and “Samson” (E 440, 443-45), praise brave men. At least until the publication of Alexander Gilchrist’s biography in 1863, Blake could be characterized as a “hidden” artist and poet, brave in the realms of imagination.
 				
Blake and his wife, Catherine, lived at 23 Green Street (now called Irving Street), Leicester Fields, from Aug. 1782 until they moved to 27 Broad Street late in 1784. Thus, the inscription on the title page records Blake’s residence when Poetical Sketches was printed. The Blakes evidently rented their lodging from Thomas Taylor (not the Platonist); he paid the rates on the property for these years (see BR[2] 740-41). The auction cat. claims that this copy was “clearly given by Blake” and that the inscribed address “gives dating to the presentation.” The inscription, “at Mr Taylors …,” indicates Blake’s location, not a presentation or gift to Taylor or anyone else. Paul Miner discovered that the aptly named Taylor was a tailor, as reported in [David V. Erdman], “Blake’s Landlord,” Bulletin of the New York Public Library 63 (Feb. 1959): 61. Perhaps Taylor had a shop on the ground floor with a sign that included his name. If so, then “at Mr Taylors …” would be a convenient way of locating a tenant renting rooms in the same building. William Hayley used this means of providing his wife with his London address in a letter of 16 April 1789, stating that she “will easily find the House [where he was residing] by the name Basire on the door” (BR[2] 740).
 				
Blake’s Green Street address is recorded in the Royal Academy exhibition cat. of 1784 (BR[2] 850n21), but the name of his landlord was not discovered and published until 1958—see Miner, “William Blake’s London Residences,” Bulletin of the New York Public Library 62 (Nov. 1958): 539-40. Bentley, Gourlay, Viscomi, Windle, and I believe that the handwriting on the title page is certainly earlier than the mid-20th century. Indeed, the similarities between Blake’s hand and the title-page inscriptions suggest that the writer of the latter also learned penmanship in the 18th century. It seems probable that the inscriber of “at Mr Taylors …” had personal knowledge of Blake’s whereabouts or learned it from someone who knew Blake between the time the book was printed in 1783 and late 1784. The address would serve little purpose if not written during that same period, for only then would the information be of any use to the writer or others who might wish to know where to find the book’s author. If Blake acted as a distributor of his book, this would also be the address where copies of Poetical Sketches could be obtained. In his 1828 biography of Blake, John Thomas Smith states that “the whole copy” (apparently meaning the entire print run) of Poetical Sketches “was given to Blake to sell to friends, or publish, as he might think proper” (BR[2] 606).
 				
Who among Blake’s circle of acquaintances and patrons might be a likely candidate for the author of the title-page inscriptions? Bentley has suggested, in a letter to me of 19 May 2011, that the first owner of this copy was the antiquarian, collector, and geologist John Hawkins (1761-1841; see the biography by H. S. Torrens in the ODNB). In a letter of 18 June 1783 to his wife Nancy, John Flaxman states that “Mr. Hawkins paid me a visit and at my desire has employed Blake to make him a capital drawing …” (BR[2] 28). In a letter to Hayley datable to 26 April of the next year, Flaxman indicates that Hawkins had commissioned “several drawings” from Blake and that Hawkins “is so convinced of his [Blake’s] uncommon talents that he is now endeavouring to raise a subscription to send him to finish [his] studies in Rome ….” Nothing came of this scheme, perhaps in part because, as Flaxman reports in this same letter, “Mr. Hawkins is going out of England” before “the 10th of May,” 1784 (BR[2] 31). This epistolary evidence indicates that Hawkins knew Blake (or at least knew his work) between June 1783 and May 1784, may have visited him “at Mr Taylors” or could have learned Blake’s address from Flaxman, and had a serious interest in acquiring Blake’s designs.
 				
Comparisons between the title-page inscriptions and examples of Hawkins’s handwriting confirm Bentley’s insight. Hawkins’s hand is much like Blake’s in its stroking, but is rounder and loopier—the very characteristics that distinguish the inscriptions from Blake’s own hand. Gourlay has nicely summarized some of the more telling similarities between Hawkins’s writing and the inscriptions: “the G is a good match, the habit of starting looped ascenders about a third of the way up the height, the looped uncial d, the variants of e, the tiny hairlines connecting apparently discrete letters all look right to me” (e-mail, 26 May 2011). Every letter in the title-page inscriptions has good matches in Hawkins’s letters of 29 May 1814 and 23 Aug. 1816 to Samuel Lysons, including combinations of letters such as “Mr” (second letter a superscript) and “ke.” Hawkins’s education at Helston School, Winchester College (1775-77), and Trinity College, Cambridge (1778-82), would have provided sufficient instruction in Latin literature for him to have encountered the lines from Horace quoted on the title page.
 				
Hawkins probably acquired this copy of Poetical Sketches sometime between its printing in 1783 and early May 1784 and inscribed the title page shortly after it came into his possession. It may have been a gift from Blake to this significant patron. The book may have passed to Hawkins’s elder son, John Heywood Hawkins (1802-77), who was bequeathed his father’s residence at Bignor Park, Sussex, or (less probably) to the younger son, Christopher Hawkins (1820-1903), who inherited his uncle’s Cornish properties, including Trewithen House and its library. Either line of descent probably led—either directly or through a subsequent generation—to the dealer, also residing in the south of England, named as the book’s former owner in the auction cat.: “Descendent [sic] of Frederick R. Jones, of ‘Eastbury’, Thames Ditton, Surrey, bookseller and antiques dealer, later of Adwell House, Torre, near Torquay.” Bonhams has no further ownership information. Hawkins’s “very fine mineral collection” was dispersed at “public auctions in 1905” (ODNB); perhaps Poetical Sketches left his library at about the same time. Bentley tells me (letter of 18 Aug. 2011) that there are no works by Blake in the auction of books from Hawkins’s Bignor Park library at Hodgson’s rooms, London, 16-17 Dec. 1926.
 				
The comments here on Hawkins’s handwriting are based on the 2 letters cited above (West Sussex Record Office, Chichester, Add MS 7542 folios 22, 39) and samples reproduced in The Letters of John Hawkins and Samuel Lysons 1812-1830, ed. Francis W. Steer (Chichester: West Sussex County Council, 1966) 10, 17, 21, 23, 40, 44. A Victorian watercolor drawing of Hawkins’s extensive library at Bignor Park is reproduced in I am, my dear Sir … A Selection of Letters Written Mainly to and by John Hawkins, ed. Francis W. Steer (Chichester: n.p. [privately printed?], 1959), facing 33.

5. Poetical Sketches, p. 15, detail of “Mad Song,” 1st stanza, 3.9 x 5.3 cm. Essick collection. This stanza has been emended in pen and black ink as follows:
 
Line 4. The left vertical and curving horizontal of the “u” in “unfold” have been rubbed out and a dot written over the right vertical to change the word to “infold,” as in 7 other copies. The ghostly presence of the left vertical is still visible.
 
Line 7. In “the rustling beds of dawn,” the third word has been deleted with 3 horizontal lines and “birds” written in cursive letters (except for a space between “r” and “d”) above. This emendation appears in 11 other copies. The horizontal lines and lettering above them are almost identical to those in copies E (collection of Alan Parker, London), F (Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand; see the reproduction in William Blake’s Works in Conventional Typography, ed. G. E. Bentley, Jr. [Delmar, New York: Scholars’ Facsimiles and Reprints, 1984]), and Q (Preston Blake Collection, City of Westminster Archives Centre; see the reproduction in Blake, Poetical Sketches, intro. by Robin Hamlyn [London: Tate Publishing, 2007]).
 
This copy also contains the following pen and black ink emendations:
 
P. 4, “To Winter,” 3rd line of the 3rd quatrain. The word “in” (“… and in his hand”) deleted with short pen and ink lines, as in 10 other copies.
 
P. 7, title of “Fair Elenor.” An ink droplet appears over the lower horizontal of the initial “F.” This element of the letter was clearly printed, and thus the oval ink spot would not seem to be an intentional addition to compensate for poor presswork. It is difficult to tell whether this is printing ink or ink from a pen; in either case, this feature is probably accidental.
 
P. 7, “Fair Elenor,” 2nd line of the 2nd quatrain. The “s” in “cheeks” has been rubbed out. This letter has been deleted, either by rubbing out or lining through in black ink, in 5 other copies.
 
P. 9, “Fair Elenor,” 1st line of the 15th quatrain. There appears to be a short horizontal line crossing the upper vertical of the “h” of “the” in “the bloody cloth unfolds.” This line does not have any verbal or typographic purpose and may not be intentional.
 
P. 9, “Fair Elenor,” 1st line of the 16th quatrain. The words “I am” have been rubbed out and “behold” in uncial letters written in their place, as in 8 other copies. The pen and ink letters are remarkably similar to those in copies S (Huntington Library) and Q.
 
P. 15, “Mad Song,” final line. A short vertical line appears between the 2nd and 3rd letters of “pain.” The purpose of this line is unclear; it may have been made accidently by Blake when he was writing the 2 annotations higher on this page.
 
P. 29. In the stage direction for scene 1 of “King Edward the Third,” “before / it.” is deleted with smudged horizontal lines. In copy S, the only other copy recorded as containing this deletion, the lines are less smudged.
 
I am confident that all these emendations in pen and black ink were made by Blake. The same intentional annotations—and no others—also appear in copy S, which John Flaxman left with William Long for delivery to William Hayley, as Flaxman states in a letter to Hayley of 26 April 1784 (BR[2] 31). I suspect that copy S and the newly discovered copy were annotated by Blake at about the same time. For a record of Blake’s handwritten additions in previously recorded copies, see William Blake’s Writings, ed. G. E. Bentley, Jr. (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1978) 2: 750-95.

3. A Woman Enthroned, Two Figures on Each Side. Pen and ink on laid paper, leaf 17.8 x 26.0 cm. Butlin #99, dated to c. 1775-80. Essick collection. A watermark, a large and decorative “W” within a circle, appears in the middle of the leaf. This is similar to several examples of Whatman countermarks illustrated, and said to have been used “till about 1760,” in Thomas Balston, James Whatman Father and Son (London: Methuen, 1957) 158.
 
The central figure may be a queen, gesturing to 2 men on the left. The scene would appear to be set outdoors with a tree behind the seated woman, its downward-curving branches forming a canopy behind or above her. The small, enclosed shapes on the center right and left margins may be plants; the verticals behind the backs of both pairs of standing figures hint at more tree trunks. Perhaps the 2 horizontal lines upper right, immediately above the figures’ heads and with diagonals extending down and to the right, may be the horizon (lower line) and a cloud band (upper line) with beams of light from a rising or setting sun. The horizontal line top right may be another cloud.
 
The ovoid form below the seated figure’s left hand may be a shield. If so, she might be Britannia, often represented with a shield, or Boadicea, the 1st century A.D. warrior queen of the Iceni in East Anglia. John Flaxman’s proposed monumental statue of Britannia, engraved by Blake for his friend’s Letter to the Committee for Raising the Naval Pillar (1799), includes a large round shield between the woman’s lowered left hand and the pedestal below. Most accounts of Boadicea, beginning with the Annals of Tacitus, feature how she rallied her people against the Romans and rode a chariot into battle. One notable exception is Boadicea, a play by Richard Glover first performed and published in 1753 and popular enough to be included by John Bell in his British Theatre series in 1791. The drama begins with a Roman ambassador addressing “the Icenian queen” and proffering “friendship.” Boadicea interrupts him to announce her anger and desire for “revenge.” Dumnorix, one of Boadicea’s allies, speaks next; he too rejects the ambassador’s offer. Blake’s drawing would be a fitting illustration of this scene, with the queen raising an accusatory hand toward the Romans on the left and Dumnorix and a companion standing on the right. Even the plants on the margins match Boadicea’s rhetoric when she promises to reduce Roman “bulwarks” to the level “of the meanest shrub.” A setting sun is an appropriate background emblem both for the queen’s threat to destroy her enemies and for her own impending defeat. If, however, the man far left is bearded (and thus unlikely to be a Roman) and if any one of the standing figures is female, then the composition does not fit Glover’s opening scene.
 
Blake included “Boadicea inspiring the Britons against the Romans” in a list of English history subjects he wrote in his Notebook before 1793 (E 672); this might be the subject of a drawing usually titled Frolic (Butlin #211, dated to c. 1793). Blake mentions both Britannia and Boadicea several times in Jerusalem and the latter is the subject of one of his Visionary Heads datable to c. 1819-20 (Butlin #717, now in a private San Francisco collection). If this pen and ink sketch indeed pictures an event in English history, it may be a precursor to Blake’s watercolors of c. 1779 on that subject (Butlin #51-53, 57, 60, 62, 64, 65, 67) and to “The History of England, a small book of Engravings” he lists in his advertisement To the Public of 1793 (E 693).
 
As Butlin astutely observes, this drawing is on “the borderline between William and Robert Blake; the profiles of the two figures on the left, drawn as straight vertical lines with horizontal lines to suggest eyes and mouths, are close to works attributed to Robert. However, the rest of the drawing is looser and the figures less rigid than is usual for Robert.” The triangular shape suggesting the head of the figure farthest right is also typical of Robert’s work, following the first step in manuals on how to draw. It seems unlikely, however, that both brothers worked on the drawing; the composition appears to have been executed rapidly with the same pen and ink by the same hand. If the basic design is by William, this may be one of the earliest extant drawings of his own invention and datable to the lower end of Butlin’s date range. An early date might explain the similarities between this drawing and Robert’s work. When giving Robert drawing lessons in the mid-1780s (BR[2] 33), William may have guided his younger brother along the same steps that he had followed in his youth. Procession of Monks, Met by Three Women (Butlin #100, dated to c. 1775-80) shows similar stylistic features typical of Robert’s work but is probably another very early pen and ink drawing by William.

Blake Goes Online Only
     
            

Last year at this time we announced that our content would  be online in order to optimize the many advantages of publishing on the  web—illustrations in color and more of them, looser restrictions on the  length of issues, searchability, and greater sustainability due to lower  production and mailing costs. After one transitional year of publishing  online and printed issues in parallel, we are now phasing out the  printed version.
 
With the upcoming summer 2012 issue (vol. 46, no. 1) Blake will be  published online only. We are investigating the possibilities for print  on demand, whereby copies of an issue or an article would be produced as  needed by a third-party vendor, from whom you would order directly  rather than as part of your subscription. If print on demand proves  feasible, we’ll let you know.
 
Individual subscribers will receive renewal reminders for vol. 46 via  e-mail, both a couple of weeks before and (if necessary!) a few weeks  after the subscription expiry date. Log in and go to My Subscription  (link at the top right of the page, next to Log Out) or to My Account →  Subscribe to check your expiry date and to renew.
 
Back issues of the quarterly beginning with the first issue (1967) will gradually appear as part of the William Blake Archive http://www.blakearchive.org  and be freely available there. Preparation is well under way for a  first installment. The most recent volumes of the quarterly from the  last five years, however, will continue to be available only to  subscribers on the Blake site.

“Mr CLAY of Hercules Buildings”
         
By Angus Whitehead
         
Angus Whitehead (whitehead65_99@yahoo.co.uk)  is assistant professor in English literature at the National Institute  of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. He is  coeditor of Re-Envisioning Blake (Palgrave, 2012) and is  currently completing a biography of the last years of William and  Catherine Blake and their “inheritor,” Frederick Tatham.

                 
1
       
In his manuscript “Life of Blake” (c. 1832), Frederick Tatham writes that during the 1790s William and Catherine Blake 
resided in Hercules Buildings in a pretty clean House of 8 or 10 Rooms and at first kept a servant, but finding (as M.rs  Blake declared and as every one else knows) the more service the more  Inconvenience, she like all sensible women, who are possessed of  industry and health and only moderate means, relinquished this  incessant Tax upon domestic comfort, did all the Work herself, kept the  House clean, and herself tidy, besides printing all Blakes numerous  Engravings, which was a Task alone sufficient for any industrious Woman,  but however as there is no state, or scheme, or plan, without its  accompanying Evil Blake had reason to regret his having left no one in  possession of his House during his and M.rs Blakes absense  for one day paying some friendly visit, some Thieves entered it and  carried away Plate to the Value of 60 Pounds and clothes to the amount  of 40 more. [1]
 However, as this note will demonstrate, by the end of January 1791  William and Catherine may have been all too aware that leaving a servant  in charge of 13 Hercules Buildings was no sure security against  burglary.
                 
2
       
Rate book entries for 13 Hercules Buildings,  Lambeth, reveal that by early March 1791 the Blakes had moved from their  former residence at 28 Poland Street, Soho, to their new house. [2] In the second edition of Blake Records  (2004), G. E. Bentley, Jr., suggests that the Blakes may have moved to  13 Hercules Buildings as early as “the autumn of 1790” or at least  “before the end of 1790.” [3] A short paragraph that appeared in the Evening Mail on Wednesday 26 January 1791 suggests a slightly later date for the move. The Evening Mail reports: 
A few days since the house of Mr CLAY of Hercules Buildings,  Lambeth, was stripped of every article of furniture in it during his  absence. His house-keeper who had lived with him three years is the  thief and had hired a cart to remove the goods, which were to have been  sold the next day, had not this good Lady saved him the trouble of doing  so. [4]

                 
3
       
“Mr CLAY of Hercules Buildings” can be identified  as the Blakes’ predecessor as ratepayer and resident at 13 Hercules  Buildings, William Clay. [5] The short article in the Evening Mail  indicates that Clay’s housekeeper and his furniture still occupied 13  Hercules Buildings during the last week of January 1791. If William and  Catherine Blake were unable to move into the house until the end of  January, their move from 28 Poland Street to 13 Hercules Buildings can  be dated between 24 January 1791, the earliest date we can assume Clay  vacated the premises after being robbed by his housekeeper, [6] and 9 March 1791, when Blake is first recorded as ratepayer for the property. [7]
               
 
     
   Notes   
1. Quoted in G. E. Bentley, Jr., Blake Records, 2nd ed. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) [hereafter BR(2)]  676. Bentley suggests a date of Sept. 1795 for the robbery (676fn). On  the night of 7 June 1793 Blake’s neighbor Philip Astley “of the Royal  Saloon, in Hercules Buildings” was burgled and robbed of “cash, plate,  watches, andc. andc. to the amount of 800 l.” (World 2 Sept. 1793: 3, col. c).
 
2. Blake is first recorded as payer of the poor rates for 13 Hercules Buildings on 9 Mar. 1791 (see BR[2] 744fn).
 
3. BR(2) 744 and fn (see also 742-43fn).
 
4. Evening Mail 26 Jan. 1791: 2, col. b. The article was reprinted verbatim in the “News in Brief” section of the Times on Friday 28 Jan. (3, col. c).
 
5. “Wm Clay” is  recorded as ratepayer for 13 Hercules Buildings in rate book entries for  the second, third, and fourth quarters of 1790 (see BR[2] 744fn). No other Clay is listed among the ratepayers for the twenty-three other residences in Hercules Buildings in 1790.
 
6. I.e., “a few days” before the report appeared in the Evening Mail.
 
7. The fact that, according to the Evening Mail,  Clay’s furniture was “to have been sold the next day” suggests that  about 24 Jan. Clay was in the process of vacating 13 Hercules Buildings  in anticipation of the Blakes’ moving in.

William Blake and His Circle: A Checklist of Publications and Discoveries in 2011
     
By G. E. Bentley, Jr. with the assistance of Hikari Sato for Japanese publications and of Li-Ping Geng for Chinese publications
     
G. E. Bentley, Jr. (gbentley@chass.utoronto.ca)  publishes bibliographies, biographies, and editions of William Blake  (1963 ff.), George Cumberland (1975), John Flaxman (1964), the Edwardses  of Halifax (forthcoming), and learned pigs (1980), with important  separate essays on Thomas Butts, F. J. Du Roveray, illustrated Bibles,  and James Parker.
     
Editors’ notes: A number of entries below have  a link to an online article, catalogue, or auction lot number. Some are  freely accessible and some may be behind a subscription barrier,  depending on your or your institution’s access. All are included on the  grounds that even those with restricted access often provide a freely  available abstract or excerpt.     Addenda and corrigenda to Blake Records, 2nd ed. (2004), now appear online. They are updated yearly in conjunction with the publication of the checklist.

Blake Publications and Discoveries in 2011
     
For me, one of the most important discoveries of 2011 was Google Scholar,  which allows searches in scholarly periodicals and books. Under “Blake”  for 2009–11 there were 48,400 entries in early November 2011, which  effectively frightened me off. But I did plough through 5,950 entries  under “William Blake” for 2009–11, or rather I tried to do so, but  (somewhat to my relief) I was only allowed to see the first thousand.  The information is often not comprehensive, omitting pagination and  sometimes even author (in which case I have had to ignore it). Entries  in other scripts such as Arabic and Chinese and Greek and Hebrew and  Japanese and Korean may be incompletely metamorphosed into English or  any other European language or script, and the titles may be translated,  but they are never transliterated. But Google Scholar does provide wonderfully broad coverage, and a very substantial number of entries here derive from it.
     
An online resource which is new to me is Newspaper Archive, which advertises 120,000,000 articles and is indeed very capacious and rewarding.
     
The two workhorses of Blake scholarship,  Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace,” which is customarily  meticulous and deft, and G. E. Bentley, Jr., “William Blake and His  Circle,” are occasionally capable of a caracole: the sketch of The Olympic Devils, implausibly attributed to Blake, “attracted 17 bidders, 16 of whom were fortunate.”Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2010,” Blake 44.4 (spring 2011): 125.
     
There was a scattering of new references to Blake in works  published before Gilchrist opened the floodgates in 1863. These were in  1798 (see Young in Part III), 1800 (Hayley, Essay on Sculpture, in Part III; Tilloch in Part VI), 1801 (Hartley in Part III), 1818 (Anon., “Forged Bank-Notes,” in Part VI), 1843 (“The Chimney Sweeper” in Part IB), 1845 (Saunders in Part VI), 1846 (1846 in Part IV), 1847, 1848, 1853 (Lester in Part VI), 1853 (John Duke Coleridge in Part VI), 1856 (Arvine and Stephens in Part VI), 1857 (Symington in Part VI), 1860 (1860 in Part IB) and 1861 (Gilchrist  in Part VI). Perhaps the most interesting are those of 1800 and 1818  about Blake’s connection with Tilloch’s attempt to suppress forgery of  bank notes and the newly recorded advertisements of 1798 for Young’s Night Thoughts.

a. The books include reprints. Editions and catalogues are subdivisions of books, and reviews are a subdivision of essays.     b. One hundred reviews in BB were published before 1863.     c. The miscellaneous sources include the Essick collection, the online versions of the Times [London] and the New York Times, reviews in Philological Quarterly (1925-69), and reviews in Blake before 1992, when I began reporting reviews in this checklist.
     
The non-English languages recorded for Blake studies in 2011 were Arabic, Chinese, Croatian,I  am told that when Yugoslavia divided into Bosnia and Herzegovina,  Kosovo (Albanian), Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia,  each country declared that it had its own language, and some are  mutually understandable with ease. French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Montenegrin, Portuguese, Romanian, Serbian, and Spanish.Unlike  in past years, there was no Blake publication recorded in Danish,  Greek, Macedonian, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Slovenian, or Swedish.  Note that the sudden surge of Chinese publications about Blake (Wei  Lian Bu Lai Ke) does not mean that in 2011 there were suddenly more  publications in Chinese than previously. It means that suddenly I have  discovered how to find them. Most of the essays in Chinese are  remarkably brief; twenty-six of them are only one or two pages. It is  worth bearing in mind two factors about this brevity. In the first  place, Chinese writing, in which one character represents a whole word,  is far more concise than alphabetical writing, in which, for example,  “alphabetical” requires twelve characters. In Chinese, a 5,000-word  essay would require only three pages. And in the second place,  candidates for the MA (a three-year degree) must publish two articles to  qualify for the degree, though the quality of the essay and journal may  be very modest. More than one entry is in Arabic, which I cannot read.E.g., author illegible to me, “[Utopia or Labyrinth of Reason? William Blake’s Polemic with Francis Bacon],” about the New Atlantis and The Book of Urizen.
     
Doctoral dissertations noticed in 2011 are from Coimbra (2009),  Exeter (2010), Harvard (2010), Indiana (2011), Michigan (2011), City  University of New York (2010), Yale (2011), and York (England) (2010).
     
Web Sites on Blake
     
Web sites are a problem. New ones pop up (many), and old ones die  (not many). Some sites never change, and some change frequently. In  2011 web sites devoted exclusively or significantly to Blake included:
     
       
Bentley Collection,  a catalogue of the works related to Blake and his circle given in 2005  to the library of Victoria University in the University of Toronto, and  subsequent additions thereto.
       
Blake Digital Text Project, created by Nelson Hilton, with an electronic version of The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, ed. David V. Erdman, the Concordance of Erdman et al., a “graphical hypertext” of Blake’s Songs, and a hypertext edition of “The Everlasting Gospel” by David Owen, plus bibliographical material.
       
The Blake Society (London), for lectures, a journal, and Blake advocacy.
       
Blake 2.0, a “community portal” devoted to Blake studies, ed. Jason Whittaker and Roger Whitson, with a blog (Zoamorphosis), podcasts, and a digital reading project.
       
The Cynic Sang, “the (un)official blog of the William Blake Archive,” by members of the University of Rochester archive team.
       
The Friends of William Blake, by Luis and Carol Garrido, with information about Blake’s burial site.
       
An Island in the Moon, with video, photos, and a text of the 1983 Cornell theatrical production of Joseph Viscomi, with music by Margaret LaFrance.
       
Project Blake, on Blake community events in London.
       
The William Blake Archive,  ed. Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi, with searchable  electronic editions of Blake’s literary and artistic works,  bibliographies, collection lists, and an electronic version of The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, ed. David V. Erdman.
     
     
Blake’s Writings
     
Two prints from Songs of Innocence and of Experience (o) have been newly recorded in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the first known loose print (pl. 15) from For Children: The Gates of Paradise was offered for sale. How extraordinary that new copies of Blake prints should still turn up.
     
Untraced letters from Blake and to him have been newly identified  below. Alas, the possibility of actually finding any of these letters  is extraordinarily slight.
     
Printings of single poems by Blake in 1843 and 1860 are newly recorded here.
     
By far the most exciting newly recorded copy of a literary work by Blake is Poetical Sketches  (Y). It had not been recorded at all until it was offered for sale in  2011 and acquired by Robert N. Essick. It bears manuscript corrections  by Blake like those in other copies distributed by or for him, and they  are identical to those in copy S sent by John Flaxman to William Hayley  in April 1784. The recipient was apparently John Hawkins, Blake’s early  admirer—the handwriting on the title page is his. He seems to have  acquired his copy very soon after the book was printed in 1783, for the  address he wrote on it (“at Mr Taylors Green St. Leicester  fields”) was one where Blake lived only in 1782-84. Hawkins commissioned  drawings from Blake, but this is the only Blake work he is known to  have owned. This copy of Poetical Sketches helps to illuminate the most obscure period of Blake’s creative life.
     
The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, edited with an  introduction and commentary by Michael Phillips (2011), is an important  edition, generously illustrated with 169 reproductions, including  colored prints of copies B, K, and M. These reproductions make it  particularly valuable. They are accompanied by a long, detailed, and  careful study of the Marriage, generously supported by useful  information in the notes.  The study often seems to be designed to  correct, not very effectively in my view, the arguments about dates of  composition, etching, and printing in Joseph Viscomi, Blake and the Idea of the Book (1993).
     
Commercial Engravings
       
There are ambitious if uncertainly successful essays here on the costs of Hayley’s Designs to a Series of Ballads (1802) and the hypothetical costs of colored copies of Young’s Night Thoughts (1797).
     
Catalogues and Bibliographies
       
The most remarkable new catalogues were John Windle’s gorgeous Omnium Gatherum (2011) and Pictorial Blake (2011), the latter in particular with an impressive number of single prints from Blake’s commercial book engravings.
     
Criticism, Biography, and Scholarship
       
The most prolific performer in 2011 has been Paul Miner, who  published twenty essays in the year, mostly about allusions in Blake’s  works. His first publication on Blake of which I have record was  fifty-four years ago, in 1958, and between then and 2010 he published at  least twenty-six more essays on Blake. This prodigious fecundity is the  more remarkable because he has not had the leisure and resources of an  academic, and his hometown of Ponca City, Oklahoma, is not known for its  library riches.       One of the most remarkable Blake publications of 2011 was the special issue of the University of Toronto Quarterly (fall 2011), edited by Karen Mulhallen. This was phase five of the William Blake Project. The previous phases were (1) Blake in Our Time: Essays in Honour of G. E. Bentley Jr,  edited by Mulhallen (2010); (2) the symposium Blake in Our Time: A  Symposium Celebrating the Future of Blake Studies and the Legacy of G.  E. Bentley Jr (2010), orchestrated by Mulhallen; (3) the symposium  exhibition (2010); and (4) the catalogue of it called Remember Me!  Blake in Our Time: A Keepsake Book in Celebration of an Exhibition and  Symposium on the Life and Art of William Blake (1757-1827) (2010). This is a very impressive panoply of scholarship and a wonderful credit to Mulhallen.
     
Biography
       
Some of the best and most durable work today is being done on  Blake’s biographical context. An example of this is Dennis M. Read, R. H. Cromek, Engraver, Editor, and Entrepreneur  (2011). The factual part of the book, derived largely from six of his  previously published essays, provides a sympathetic and reliable  portrait of Cromek as a traveling salesman. Read’s benevolent  conclusions as to Cromek’s amiability and reliability are a good deal  more generous than those of most students of Blake will be, even after  they have read and admired the book.       Angus Whitehead, “‘I write in South Molton Street, what I both see and hear’: Reconstructing William and Catherine Blake’s Residence and Studio at 17 South Molton Street, Oxford Street,” British Art Journal  (2010), is original, richly detailed, and valuable. His “‘humble but  respectable’: Recovering the Neighbourhood Surrounding William and  Catherine Blake’s Last Residence, No. 3 Fountain Court, Strand, c.  1820-27,” University of Toronto Quarterly (2011), has copious  information about Blake’s neighbors, particularly about periods of  residence in Fountain Court, professions, and ages, whilst his  extraordinarily detailed essay “‘an excellent saleswoman’: The Last  Years of Catherine Blake,” Blake (2011-12), provides crucial new evidence on where Catherine lived and when, and about Frederick Tatham and his young wife.       Mary Lynn Johnson, “‘Catalogue of Some of Blake’s Pictures at “The  Salterns”’: Captain Butts as Exhibitor, Litigator, and Co-Heir (with  His Sister Blanche),” University of Toronto Quarterly (2011), provides a great deal of information about the Blake heritage of the Butts family about 1850-1905.
     
Engravings
       
Minute portions of Blake’s career as an engraver are dealt with  in several new works. Wayne C. Ripley, “‘In Great Forwardness’?: 1798  Advertisements for Volume Two of William Blake’s Night Thoughts,” Notes and Queries  (2011), gives valuable new details about Blake’s most ambitious  engraving commission. Mark Crosby, “Blake and the Banknote Crises of  1797, 1800, and 1818,” University of Toronto Quarterly (2011),  is concerned with the context of Blake’s support of Alexander Tilloch’s  effort to produce forgery-proof bank notes. G. E. Bentley, Jr., “Remember Me! Customs and Costumes of Blake’s Gift Book,” University of Toronto Quarterly (2011), deals with the variety of binding decorations in Remember Me! and suggests a reason for the modesty of its sales.
     
Bibliography
       
A considerable addition to the record in English of works on  Blake in Japan is provided by the admirable and apparently exhaustive  essay by Hikari Sato, “Meiji Taisho kino William Blake Shoshi Gakusha  tachi—Yanagi Muneyoshi, Jugaku Bunsho, Sangu Makoto: William Blake  Bibliographers in Japan in the 1910s and the 1920s—YANAGI Muneyoshi,  JUGAKU Bunsho, and SANGU Makoto,” Choiki Bunka Kagaku Kiyo: Interdisciplinary Cultural Studies (2011).
     
Theology
       
Christopher Rowland, Blake and the Bible (2011), is a careful and learned account of Blake in a theological context.
     
Interpretation
       
Susanne M. Sklar, Blake’s Jerusalem as Visionary Theatre: Entering the Divine Body  (2011), argues that “Blake’s tantalizing words become comprehensible  when they are heard” (147). The thesis is argued in a different context  in her “‘In the Mouth of a True Orator’ (Jerusalem’s Operating Instructions),” University of Toronto Quarterly (2011).

The annual checklist of scholarship and discoveries concerning  William Blake and his circle records publications and discoveries for  the current year (say, 2011) and those for previous years which are not  recorded in Blake Books, Blake Books Supplement, and “William Blake and His Circle.” Installments of “William Blake and His Circle” are continuations of Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement, with similar principles and conventions.
     
I have made no systematic attempt to record audio books and  magazines, blogs, broadcasts on radio and television, calendars,  CD-ROMs, chinaware, coffee mugs, comic books, computer printouts  (unpublished), conferences, electronic editions of works by Blake,For example, William Blake: The Complete Works, which seems to include merely a biography (he was born at “28A Broad Street”) and 180 reproductions in color.  e-mails, festivals and lecture series, furniture, jewelry, lectures on  audiocassettes, lipstick, manuscripts, microforms, mosaics, movies,  murals, music, notebooks (blank), novels merely tangentially about Blake,For instance, §Severin Rossetti, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (Kindle edition, 2010). pageants, performances, pillows, playing cards, podcasts, poems about Blake,Such as §Eleanor Cooke, “Mr. Blake and the Baglady,” The Return (London: Salt, 2010).  portraits, postcards, posters and pictures, recorded readings and  singings, refrigerator magnets, stained-glass windows, stamps (postage  and rubber), stickers, sweatshirts, T-shirts, tattoos, tiles,  typescripts (unpublished), video recordings, and web sites.
     
I take Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement, faute de mieux, to be the standard bibliographical books on Blake,Except for the states of the prints for Blake’s commercial book engravings, where the standard authority is Robert N. Essick, William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations  (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991). Significant further details,  especially about collations, are given in Roger R. Easson and Essick, William Blake Book Illustrator: A Bibliography and Catalogue of the Commercial Engravings,  vol. 1: Plates Designed and Engraved by Blake (Normal: American Blake  Foundation, 1972); vol. 2: Plates Designed or Engraved by Blake  1774-1796 (Memphis: American Blake Foundation, 1979); vol. 3 never  appeared. The standard authority for Blake prints issued separately is  Essick, The Separate Plates of William Blake: A Catalogue (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983). and have noted significant differences from them.       The organization of Division I of the checklist is as in Blake Books.  In Part VI: Criticism, Biography, and Scholarly Studies, collections of  essays on Blake are listed under the names of the editors, and issues  of periodicals devoted extensively to him are listed under the titles.  Reviews, listed here under the book reviewed, are only for works which  are chiefly about Blake, not for those with only, say, a chapter on  Blake. Note that Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement normally do not include reviews.       Division II: Blake’s Circle is organized by individual (say,  William Hayley or John Flaxman), with works by and about Blake’s friends  and patrons, living individuals with whom he had significant direct and  demonstrable contact. It does not include important contemporaries with  whom Blake’s contact was negligible or nonexistent, such as John  Constable and William Wordsworth and Edmund Burke. There is nothing in Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement corresponding to Division II.
     
Research for this checklist was carried out particularly in the  libraries of the University of Toronto and Victoria University in the  University of Toronto, as well as with the electronic resources of Copac, Google Books, Google Scholar, and WorldCat. Works published in Japan were found in CiNii (National Institute of Informatics Scholarly and Academic Information Navigator), the National Diet Library online catalogue,  Komaba Library and the General Library of the University of Tokyo, and  the National Diet Library. For publications in China, works were found  in the National Library of China  (Beijing) and the databases of Complete Texts for Periodicals in China,  VIP Chinese Periodicals in Science and Technology, and Wan Fang Data  (digitized periodicals). These Chinese online databases are very  difficult of access.

For Children: The Gates of Paradise (1793)
   
Newly Recorded Impression
   Plate 15   Binding: Loose, inscribed “13” at the lower left, second state.   History: Offered privately by Larkhall Fine Art in Dec. 2011 to Robert N. Essick, the source of my information about it.   
No other loose print from For Children is known, and no copy of For Children is missing a plate.
   
Letters
   
Newly Recorded
   
Blake repeatedly referred to money received or parcels  sent (e.g., with proofs or books), and these were probably accompanied  by letters, but they are not included here unless a letter is mentioned.  All are untraced; dates in italics indicate that the letter is written  to Blake.
   
1799 22? Aug. from Dr. John Trusler
     
Between 16 and 23 Aug. 1799, Dr. Trusler sent Blake  “a Letter full of Criticisms” of Blake’s art which is quoted and  paraphrased in Blake’s letters of 23 and 26 Aug.
   
1800 12 Sept. to William Hayley?
     
In his letter of 12 Sept. 1800, Blake asked Flaxman,  “Be so kind as to Read and then Seal the Inclosed and Send it on  its much beloved Mission.” Perhaps the intended recipient was Hayley.
   
1802 Jan. from Thomas Butts
     
In his letter to Butts of 10 Jan. 1802, Blake referred to and partly paraphrased “Your very kind and affectionate Letter.”
   
1802 Nov. from James Blake
     
Blake wrote on 22 Nov. 1802, “My Brother tells me ...,” presumably in a letter.
   
1802 22 Nov. to James Blake
     
In his letter to Butts of 22 Nov. 1802 Blake wrote,  “I have taken the liberty to trouble you with a letter to my Brother  which you will be so kind as to send or give him.”
   
1803 Jan. from James Blake
     
“Your Letter mentioning Mr Butts’s account of my Ague” is mentioned in Blake’s letter to his brother James of 30 Jan. 1803.
   
1803 late April from James Blake
     
In his letter to Butts of 25 April 1803, Blake referred to “a pressing Letter from my Brother.”
   
1803 late April from Thomas Butts

This is a long-announced, detailed, and careful study of the Marriage. Much of it aims, often silently and rather ineffectively, to correct Joseph Viscomi, Blake and the Idea of the Book (1993). The detailed arguments about dates of composition, etching, and printing are not persuasive.

“Pickering [Ballads] Manuscript” (?after 1807)
   Paper: The Pickering Manuscript p. 16 has a printed catchword (“With”) from Hayley’s Designs to a Series of Ballads (1802) p. 20 (E3v) BB p. 341n2﻿. Therefore the 22 pages of the Pickering Manuscript probably came from Designs ballad 1, pp. 5-10 (B2r-B4v) and ballad 2, pp. 11-26 (D1r-E4v).The paper in the Pickering Manuscript is uniform, but it is only an hypothesis that it all comes from Hayley’s Designs to a Series of Ballads and that the leaves are in the same order as in the Designs.  The paper comes from the inner margins of conjugate unfolded sheets with the text cut away. The Designs paper sometimes shows a watermark of “1802.”   Paper size: 12.5 x 18.4 cm. BB p. 342﻿. Since the leaves from Hayley’s Designs are 23.5 x 29.4 cm., therefore 11 cm. were trimmed from each dimension of the Designs  leaves to make the Pickering Manuscript leaves. The outer margins were  trimmed to remove irrelevant printed text, but why were 11 cm. cut off  the tops or bottoms?   Binding: The leaves have stabholes in the inner margins 3.9 cm. from the top and 4.5, 4.6 cm. apart BB p. 342﻿. If they had been stabbed when they were part of Designs to a Series of Ballads, one might expect to find two sets of stabholes, the first from when they were part of Hayley’s Designs and the second from when they became part of the Pickering Manuscript. The absence of duplicate stabholes suggests that the Designs leaves were loose when they were converted to the Pickering Manuscript.

Robson, who acquired Innocence (E) “at  Leicester in or about the year 1899” and sold it at Sotheby’s, 15 Dec.  1926, is probably Charles Raynor Robson (1869-1947), schoolmaster of  Leicester and cricketer, as I am told by Stephen Massil.

Account (1800)
   
Blake wrote to Thomas Butts on 22 Sept. 1800, “My Sister will ... bring with her your account,” but no such account is known.
   
Account (1802)
   
On 22 Nov. 1802 Blake wrote to Butts, “I have inclosed  the Account of Money recievd and work done,” but no such account is  known.
   
Account book (1804)
   
Blake referred in his letter to William Hayley of 28 Dec. 1804 to “my account Book in which I have regularly written down Every Sum I have recievd from you,”Joseph Viscomi, Blake and the Idea of the Book (1993) 250, remarks: “Blake apparently kept no ledger detailing the cost of supplies.” but no such account book is now known.
   
Canterbury Pilgrims subscription (1806)
   
According to Gilchrist, Life of William Blake, “Pictor Ignotus” (1863) 1: 204, “a subscription paper for an engraving of the Canterbury Pilgrims had been circulated by Blake’s friends ... in 1806, two years before publication of The Grave  [1808].” No other reference to this “subscription paper” is known. It  must have been compiled either by Blake or from his information. The  subscription paper cannot be “Blake’s Chaucer: The Canterbury Pilgrims”  (“May 15th 1809”) or “Blake’s Chaucer: An Original Engraving” (n.d., watermark 1810),Copies of each belonged to Gilchrist’s son. which silently quote from the Descriptive Catalogue  (1809). The date is important, for it seems to demonstrate that Blake’s  plan to engrave the Canterbury Pilgrims decisively preceded that of his  rival Stothard.
   
Ticket of admission to Blake’s exhibition of 1809-10
   
The only evidence for the existence of the ticket is  in the postscript to Blake’s letter of May 1809 to Ozias Humphry: “I  inclose a ticket of admission if you should honour my Exhibition with a  Visit.”

Blake is named only in the contents. In l. 10,  “Beneath the bosom of the sea,” Lawrence gives “bottom” for Blake’s  “bosom,” a variant I have not noticed elsewhere. The poem is not in  Malkin; it seems to have been first printed in conventional typography  by H. C. Robinson (1811) (BR[2] 585). There were earlier editions of Cameos in 1831, 1833, and 1834, but I do not know whether they include “To the Muses.”

Hayley’s Designs to a Series of Ballads were from the first a commercial undertaking. Hayley said that they were intended “for the Emolument of Mr Blake the artist,”Hayley’s autobiography, quoted in BR(2) 123. and he actively engaged his friends to become ballad mongers. The work was published at Blake’s expense and for his benefit.   

Debits and Credits
   
The chief cash costs were for (1) copperplates for the  6 large and 8 small engravings, (2) paper for text (watermarked “1802”)  including separate printed blue covers and large prints, and (3) paper  and printing the 10¼ sheets of text and the covers by Joseph Seagrave in  Chichester (the Blakes printed the engravings in Felpham). There was no  cost for advertising (except in review copies), and no payment to the  author, the designer, the engraver, and the plate printers, except in  possible profit from sales. There was no profit.
   
The 14 copperplates must have weighed 2,464.6 g (5½ pounds) and cost £3.13.1½.G. E. Bentley, Jr., “Blake’s Heavy Metal: The History, Weight, Uses, Cost, and Makers of His Copper Plates,” University of Toronto Quarterly 76.2 (spring 2007): 740. The text consisted of 37 quarto leaves, with prints on pp. iv, 1, 9, 11, 26, 27, 39, 41:

9¼ sheets
        
   
In addition, there are 6 leaves (1½ quarto sheets)  with full-page prints for preliminaries (1 print) and ballad 1 (1),  ballad 2 (1), ballad 3 (1), and ballad 4 (2). Each complete set of the Designs, all four parts, used 43 leaves, 10¾ quarto sheets.
   
The text must have been printed by Seagrave in four  print runs, one in late May 1802 for the preliminaries and ballad 1, one  in late June for ballad 2, one in late July for ballad 3, and one in  early September for ballad 4. The engravings, however, were only printed  as they were called for.
   
For paper for the full-page prints in the Designs,  “Blake has ... [arranged] for his Ballads to deal with his own  stationer in London, and send it down as He thought proper,” according  to Hayley’s letter of 6 July 1802.
   
We do not know how many copies of the Designs  were printed or what Seagrave’s charges were for printing and paper,  but we may make educated estimates based on Blake’s statement in his  letter of 28 Dec. 1804 that he paid Seagrave “30 Pounds ... in part of his Account”Hayley wrote on 3 Apr. 1803 that Blake “has paid a Bill of 30£ for paper” [and printing] for the Designs. and on contemporary printing prices. On 10 Oct. 1800 Thomas Bensley estimated that the cost of paper, printing, and hot-pressing 1,000 quarto copies of Thomson’s Seasons (5 sheets each) for F. J. Du Roveray would be £15.15.0 per sheet (£78.15 in all).Quoted  from the manuscript in the Huntington Library; see G. E. Bentley, Jr.,  “F. J. Du Roveray, Illustrated-Book Publisher 1798-1806: The Amateur and  the Trade,” Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin 12 (1988): 70. Perhaps Blake’s provincial printer Seagrave charged him £15 for paper and printing per thousand quarto sheets.
   
It is a mere informed guess that the print run for  ballad 1 was 250 copies and that this was continued for ballad 2 when  the sales for ballad 1 at first seemed promising. When the sales for  ballad 2 proved disastrous, Blake must have reduced his print order,  perhaps to 150 copies, for ballads 3-4. The expenses of printing and  paper might have been as follows:
   
            
Cost of 250 copies of ballads 1-2

a. The medium plate paper for Flaxman’s Iliad (1805) cost £4.8.0 per ream in 1805 and £5 in 1808 (BB  pp. 561-62). The cheap blue paper for the covers (400 sheets for  ballads 1-2, 200 sheets for ballads 3-4) would have cost a good deal  less than the fine white paper.
    
Presumably Seagrave printed copies of each ballad in  Chichester and sent them to Blake in Felpham; Blake and his wife then  printed engravings on text plates plus the full-page plates as the need  arose, not all at once. Hayley wrote to Lady  Hesketh on 10 June 1802, “He and his excellent Wife (a true Helpmate!)  pass the plates thro’ a rolling press in their own cottage together;  and of course it is a work of some Time to collect a Number of  Impressions.”Hayley repeats this in his  letter to R. H. Evans on 3 April 1803: “He and his good industrious Wife  together take all the Impressions from the various Engravings in their  own domestic Press.”
   
When there proved to be demand for only a few score  copies, Blake was left with many copies of the printed text which were  of no commercial value. He cannily kept these  printed sheets, even taking them back to London with him in 1803, at  considerable trouble, and he made drawings on them for the rest of his  life, including designs for Blair’s Grave (1805), Malkin’s Memoirs (1806), Job and Dante (c. 1824).BB pp. 574-75 and BBS pp. 221-22 record 47 leaves from the Designs used as scrap paper (see also the “Pickering Manuscript” in Part IA), but none for finished engravings. (The “Riddle Manuscript” is on the verso of a proof-before-letters from the Designs.)  There are 9 leaves used as scrap from part 1, 24 from part 2, 8 from  part 3, and 6 from part 4, which might suggest that part 2 provided most  unvendible copies. A disproportionate number of scraps are on leaves  which would have had prints on them: pp. 9 (5), 11 (1), 26 (6), 27 (1),  41 (2). No print from the Designs is known to have been reused.   

Sales
   
The first reports of sales were encouraging. On 29  June 1802 Hayley wrote that ballad 1 was “marching triumphantly on the  road of prosperity,” and as late as 30 Jan. 1803 Blake wrote to his  brother: “These Ballads are likely to be Profitable for we have Sold all  that we have had time to print. Evans the Bookseller in Pallmall says  they go off very well.”
   
However, Hayley told R. H. Evans on 3 April 1803: “He  has paid a Bill of 30£ for paper and the copies He has disposed of in  the country have not produced more than half that sum£15  would have paid for 120 individual ballads at 2s. 6d. each. However, we  know that Lady Hesketh paid £5.5.0 for 10 copies and Flaxman £1.17.6  for 4, leaving only £7.17.6 (£15 - £7.2.6) or 63 copies. to  reimburse Him.” The £30 for Seagrave was apparently partly advanced by  Hayley, for on 28 Dec. 1804 Blake thanked him for “the Twelve Guineas  which you Lent Me when I made up 30 Pounds to pay our Worthy Seagrave in  part of his Account.” Blake wrote on 26 Oct. 1803, “Mr. Evans ... gives  small hopes of our ballads; he says he has sold but fifteen numbers at  the most, and that going on would be a certain loss of almost all the  expenses,” and on 22 Jan. 1805 he wrote that the London bookseller  Phillips advised that “we must consider all that has been printed as  lost, and begin anew.”
   
The Designs to a Series of Ballads were  printed by J. Seagrave in Chichester and sold by him and P. Humphry and  R. H. Evans in London “for W. BLAKE, Felpham.” We do not know how many  copies Seagrave sold—perhaps he only provided the copy for the reviewer  in the Sussex Chronicle and Chichester Advertiser (2 June 1802), which he printed—but we have good information about how many were sold by Evans in London (15, worth £1.17.6)The  sales by Evans included ballads 1-3 for Anna Seward and 3-4 for Lady  Hesketh and some of her friends; Evans would have deducted his  commission. We have no information about sales by Humphry. and how many were disposed of by friends of Blake and Hayley (120, worth £15),We  can account for sales of 62 copies of ballad 1, 19 of ballad 2, 10 of  ballad 3, and 12 of ballad 4 = 103 in all. Only 53 numbers have been  traced today. mostly in the country.

Various
       
Friends took 22 copies. [c]
        
   
a.  The numbers sold by Evans must have included all the copies sold through  the booksellers: 5 copies each (10 in all) of #3-4 for Lady Hesketh,  “my Sistr and some other friends” (BR[2] 146)  (probably Lord and Lady Harcourt, Richard Hurd, and Dr. Randolph, who  took #1 through her), 1 set of #1-3 (3 in all) for Anna Seward, and 1  copy of #1 through Conder’s in Bucklesbury. This means that Evans may  have sold only 1 copy or none through the 3 Bath libraries which  displayed copies or from the “long list of Cowpers” whom Lady Hesketh had directed to subscribe (BR [2] 135).   The list of sales by Evans does not include the free review copies for the European Magazine (#1-2), Poetical Register (#1-3), or the copy still unsold in his 1804 catalogue.   b. Letter of 16 Dec. 1802 in The Collected Letters of Charlotte Smith, ed. Judith Phillips Stanton (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2003) 503: Hayley’s “publication about animals.”   c. Sales “in the country” (i.e., through friends of Hayley and Blake) came to about £15, the price of 120 copies (see note above). We can account for sales through friends of 98 copies, suggesting that they sold 22 of which we have no other record.
      
Blake’s probable expenses for the Designs  were therefore for paper and printing (£30.16.0), copper (£3.13.1½), and  advertising (15s. for 6 review copies), or £35.4.1½ in all, and his  probable receipts (£16.7.6) left him considerably out of pocket.  Hayley’s generous gesture had been a disaster for Blake, not only in  losing money but also in wasting his creative genius.

An announcement of its publication appeared in the Morning Post for 1 May 1800.See Mark Crosby, “Blake and the Banknote Crises of 1797, 1800, and 1818,” University of Toronto Quarterly 80.4 (2011): 829.
   
Hayley, William, The Life of George Romney (1809)
   
Blake asked £31.10.0 for “finishd” quarto plates and  £15.15.0 for the “less finishd,” according to his letter of 22 June  1804. He engraved two finished plates, but one was not used.
   
He referred to his engraving of the self-portrait of Romney in many letters (see BB  p. 577), but it was not published, and no copy has previously been  reported. However, a proof-before-letters of a quarto engraving of  Romney was offered by §Grosvenor Prints (London) in April 2011; Robert  N. Essick thinks it might be the one by Blake, and Mark Crosby will  publish an article about it in Blake.

To the entry in Blake  (2011) reporting Robert N. Essick’s suggestion about the involvement of  Blake’s apprentice, Thomas Owen, I would add that the alterations in  1792 and 1793 (described in Essick, William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations  [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991] 50-51), which are more like Blake’s  usual style of engraving, may be by the master correcting the work of  his apprentice.

R. Noble, the printer of Night Thoughts,  was a jobbing printer—or perhaps two printers—whose residence was given  as 4 Great Shire Lane, Temple Bar, in 1790, 1794-1800, and who  registered press(es) at Green Arbour Court, Old Bailey, in 1799 and  1800.According to William B. Todd, A Directory of Printers and Others in Allied Trades, London and Vicinity 1800-1840  (London: Printing Historical Society, 1972), Richard Noble, printer, of  4 Great Shire Lane, Temple Bar, registered his press under the new law  on 30 Aug. 1799 with Joseph Burt and again by himself on 17 Jan. 1800.  Robert Noble, printer, resident at 4 Great Shire Lane, registered his  press with Joseph Burt at Green Arbour Court, Old Bailey, on 16 Jan.  1800. William Calvert, printer, of 4 Great Shire Lane, registered a  press with James Calvert on 1 July 1801 and operated it in 1801-23. R.  Noble was not apprenticed in the Stationers’ Company, according to Stationers’ Company Apprentices 1701-1800, ed. D. F. McKenzie (Oxford: Oxford Bibliographical Society, 1978).  I have traced his imprint on 55 editions printed in 1790-1804, mostly  (36) in 1800-01; there were only 3 in 1796-98, and only one of the Noble  editions was a folio, Young’s Night Thoughts. R. Noble was far  from the achievement—and probably from the expense—of the great rivals  of Richard Edwards, Thomas Bensley with Macklin’s great folio Bible  (1800), and William Bulmer with the Boydells’ great folio Shakespeare  (1791-1805) and Milton (1793-97).

a. For Thomas Bensley’s rate for Thomson’s Seasons, 22 lines to a page, see the costs of Hayley’s Designs, above. The charges of R. Noble, the printer of Night Thoughts with 30 lines to a page, were probably about the same.Over 160 copies have been located in public collections, and perhaps 90 more are in private hands or were destroyed.   b. The engravings were printed on the text pages and therefore required no additional paper.   c. Printing the plates for Flaxman’s Iliad (1805) cost 6s. per hundred pulls (BB p. 561).   d. The binding of Flaxman’s Iliad cost 2s. 2d. each (BB p. 561).   e. Advertisements appeared in a separate flier and in Monthly Magazine 2 (Nov. 1796): 807, True Briton (31 March 1798), and the Times (9, 11 July 1798), the last three after Richard Edwards retired. There were notices in the Edinburgh Magazine ns 8 (Dec. 1796): 450, Monthly Epitome 1 (Jan. 1797): 79, and Monthly Magazine 5 (June 1798): 455.
   
It would be agreeable to think that the Blakes were paid for printing the engravings.
   
Payments   

The heaviest investor in the work was William Blake. He had asked £105 for his watercolors; instead he received £21 (9d. per design)Joseph Farington’s diary, 24 June 1796 (BR[2] 71). Blake’s friend J. T. Smith called it a “despicably low ... price” (Nollekens and His Times [1828]; see BR[2] 610).  plus a ream of paper (£5.0.0). We do not know how much or even whether  he was paid for his 43 folio engravings. At the very least he should  have expected £5.5.0 each for these very large plates (c. 33 x 41 cm.), the sum he received for his smaller outline plates (c. 35 x 25 cm.) for Flaxman’s Iliad (1805) and Hesiod (1817),BB pp. 561-62, 557-58. For his 12 highly finished, slightly smaller plates for Blair’s Grave, Schiavonetti was paid perhaps £540 (BR[2] 246); he asked £63 for “The Day of Judgment” (BR[2] 245). a total of £225.15.0.
   
It is possible that Blake was  paid for his engravings not in cash but in copies of the book, valued at  £5.5.0 for all four parts or £2.2.0 for part 1 (£1.1.0 deposit and  £1.1.0 on delivery).Prospectus, BR(2) 78-79. Colored copies are not mentioned in contemporary advertisements and reviews. Blake could then color and sell them for his own profit. Perhaps he was given about 30 copies, worth £31. Twenty-eight colored copies have been traced.Copies A-T are recorded in BB pp. 642-46, 956-57, copies U-Z in BBS pp. 272-73, and copies AA-BB in Blake (2000, 2002).  Some have contemporary inscriptions associating them with Blake: copy Q  is annotated “This Copy was coloured for me by Mr Blake | W. E.”; copy R  has “This copy colrd by W. Blake”; copy C is signed  “W. Blake”; and copies C and W have notes that they were to serve “as  pattern” for coloring, presumably by Mrs. Blake. A surprising number can  be traced to contemporary owners, most of whom owned other works by  Blake: [Rebekah] Bliss (d. 1819) (D), Thomas Butts (1757-1845) (A),  Baron Dimsdale (1712-1800) (X), “W. E.” (for William Esdaile [1758-1837]  or William Ensom [1796-1832]) (Q), ?Richard Edwards (1768-1827) (B),  Thomas Gaisford (1779-1855) (G), John S. Harford, Jr. (1785-1866) (R),  John Soane (1753-1837) (F), and Earl Spencer (1758-1834) (O).
   
The Night Thoughts were colored in two  styles, one about 1797 (C-D, I-J, Q-R, U), and the other about 1805 (B,  H, L, P). Presumably this means that Blake carried copies with him when  he moved from London to Felpham in 1800 and then back again when he  returned to London in 1803.
   
How much was he paid for these colored copies? We have  no direct evidence, but we can find a comfortable analogy in the prices  of colored copies of works in illuminated printing of the same size.  Blake’s prospectus of 1793 lists uncolored copies of America with 18 folio plates at 10s. 6d. and Visions of the Daughters of Albion with 11 folio plates at 7s. 6d., while the prices for colored copies in his letter of 9 June 1818 are £5.5.0 (America) and £3.3.0 (Visions). Subtracting the prices of uncolored copies from those for colored copies indicates that the price for coloring America was 5s. 3d. per plate and Visions 5s. ½d. per plate. If Blake calculated 5s. for coloring each of the 43 folio prints in Night Thoughts, he would have charged ten guineas per copy.The printed text of Night Thoughts is thrown in gratis.About 1797 Blake was paid £10.10.0 for his 116 watercolor designs to Gray (BR[2] 246). Even with a more modest five guineas per copy, he would have received £157.10.0 for 30 copies. With this he seems to have been content.When  Blake complained of neglect by the great illustrated book publishers  Boydell, Macklin, and Bowyer (Notebook p. 23), he did not mention  Richard Edwards, the publisher of his Night Thoughts, perhaps implying that he did not feel that he had been mistreated by Edwards.
   
Advertisements   

The True Briton no. 1644 (31 March 1798) carried an advertisement for a   


SPLENDID EDITION OF YOUNG’s NIGHT   THOUGHTS.   With 150 Engravings from original Designs.   This Day is published, Price One Guinea to Subscribers,   PART I. containing FOUR BOOKS of
   YOUNG’s NIGHT THOUGHTS, illustrated with 43 very spirited Etchings, from the Designs of Mr. Blake.   
The novelty of the style in which these Engravings are  introduced, surrounding the Text they illustrate, and the masterly hand  with which they are executed, must, it is presumed, command the  attention of the Literati, the Amateur of the Fine Arts, and of the  Artist.
   
The Paper and Type will be found correspondent with  the elegance of such an Undertaking; and it is hoped that, from the  extremely low price which the Editor has fixed upon the Work to  Subscribers, it will meet with that liberal encouragement which its  intrinsic merit, as well as its novelty, may justly claim from this  enlightened and literary Age.
   
The Subscription for the whole Work is Five Guineas:  one to be paid at the time of subscribing, and one on the delivery of  each Part. The Book will be completed in Four Parts, with all the  expedition consistent with the nature of a Work of such magnitude.
   
The Price will be considerably advanced to Non-Subscribers, on the publication of the Second Part, which is in forwardness.
   
London: Sold by Mr. Edwards,  Pall-Mall; Mr. Robson and Mr. Faulder, New Bond-street; Mr. Payne, Mews  Gate; Mr. White, Fleet-street; Messrs. Robinsons, Paternoster-row; Mr.  Clarke, Bond-street; Mr. Bell, Oxford-street; and Mr. Harding,  Pall-Mall.This advertisement and those in the Times,  discussed below, were first recorded in Wayne C. Ripley, “‘In Great  Forwardness’?: 1798 Advertisements for Volume Two of William Blake’s Night Thoughts” (see Ripley  in Part VI); I have made minute adjustments on the basis of the  originals. The booksellers are James Edwards, 77 Pall Mall; James  Robson, 27 New Bond Street; Robert Faulder, 42 New Bond Street; Thomas  Payne, Mews Gate; John White, 63 Fleet Street; George, George, and John  Robinson, 25 Paternoster Row; William Clarke, 38 Bond Street; Joseph  Bell, 148 Oxford Street; and Edward Harding, 98 Pall Mall.

   
Substantially the same announcement appeared in the Times nos. 4225 and 4227 (9, 11 July 1798):   

Young’s Night Thoughts,  ſplendid Edition, with 150 Engravings from original Deſigns.--This Day  is publiſhed, price One Guinea to Subſcribers, Part the Firſt,  containing Four Books, of   YOUNG’s NIGHT THOUGHTS; illuſtrated ….The Times version differs from that in the True Briton  in (1) using the old-fashioned long “s” (ſ); (2) reducing the central  five paragraphs to one; (3) changing “whole Work is” to “whole complete  is”; (4) extending “Amateur” to “Amateurs”; (5) altering “Five”, “Four”,  and “Second” to “5”, “4”, and “2d”; (6) changing “in forwardness” to  “in great forwardness”, the only substantial change; (7) omitting  “London:” before the list of booksellers; (8) reducing the initial  capital letters to lower case in “Paper” and “Type”; and (9) replacing  “Mr.” in “Mr. Edwards” with “Messrs.” and omitting the succeeding “Mr.”s  and “Messrs.”
   
No second part was published,In  his 1799 catalogue, Thomas Payne offered “Young’s Night Thoughts … 2  numbers … 1797 and 98,” but there is no other evidence that part 2 was  ever published. though an untraced engraved proof of “the only extant leaf of Night 5” has been recorded.William  Blake: Original Drawings, Engraved Work, Poetical Works, Books about  Blake, Etc. Mainly from the Collection of Dr. Greville Macdonald (London: Francis Edwards, [?1930]), lot 44.
   
The 1798 advertisements echo the prospectus of spring  1797, correct its “forty” engravings to “43,” and add eight new  booksellers while omitting Richard Edwards. The author of the  advertisements (James Edwards?) is notably more emphatic about Blake’s  plates—a “masterly hand” which will “command the attention of the  Literati, the Amateur of the Fine Arts, and of the Artist”—than  the author (Richard Edwards?) of the “Advertisement” in the 1797  edition, who conceived “it to be unnecessary to speak” of “the merit of  Mr. Blake.”BR (2) 78-79, 76.
   
Did Richard Edwards Publish the Night Thoughts?
   
Richard Edwards was identified as the publisher in  Farington’s diary (24 June 1796), in the prospectus (?spring 1797),  along with James Edwards and Robert Bowyer, and on the title page  (1797). However, the advertisements in the True Briton (March 1798) and the Times  (July 1798) omit him and instead name James Edwards, Robson, Faulder,  Payne, White, Robinsons, Clarke, Bell, and Harding, whilst the notice in  the Monthly Magazine (June 1798) names only Robson.
   
For some time Richard Edwards had been withdrawing from business;See G. E. Bentley, Jr., The  Edwardses of Halifax: The Making and Selling of Beautiful Books in  London and Halifax by William, John, Richard, Thomas, and Especially  James Edwards, the Medician Bookseller (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, forthcoming). perhaps he did not publish Night Thoughts at all. The only known sale in 1797 is by his brother James on 6 November.BR(2) 79. After Richard Edwards withdrew from business, the Night Thoughts was taken over by a congery of booksellers headed by James Edwards, who advertised it in the True Briton and the Times. Then James Edwards too retired, and in 1798 James Robson took over the Night Thoughts.
   
The work sold very slowly, in part because the publishers kept changing. In 1811 Crabb Robinson claimed that Blake’s edition of Night Thoughts “is no longer to be bought.”[Crabb Robinson], Vaterländisches Museum (1811) (BR[2] 600). Robinson bought a copy on 27 Dec. 1810 (BR[2] 600fn).
   
The commission for the Night Thoughts was due  to the genius of Richard Edwards. He chose a fine, expensive paper  (1794 | J WHATMAN) and a fine artist and engraver (William Blake).  However, his claim in the integral advertisement that “he has shrunk from no expence”BR(2) 76. is plainly false. He allowed William Blake to bear the major part of the expense of the only volume that was published.
   
And he scarcely published the work, or perhaps he did  not publish it at all. He withdrew from business, apparently for  personal reasons, just when the Night Thoughts was finished. Apparently he never advertised it in 1797 or sent out a review copy. The contemporary obscurity of Young’s Night Thoughts (1797) with Blake’s illustrations is significantly due to the commercial neglect of Richard Edwards.
   
All 43 Night Thoughts prints are reproduced in John Windle, Pictorial Blake (see 2011 in Part IV).

   §William Blake exhibition at the Pushkin Fine Arts Museum, Moscow.   
The exhibition was organized with help from the  British Council, with 150 exhibits from the Tate, British Museum,  Victoria and Albert Museum, National Portrait Gallery, Fitzwilliam  Museum, Whitworth Art Gallery, Petworth House, and Britten-Pears  Foundation (Aldeburgh). The apparatus includes an interactive education  program.
   
Reviews, puffs, etc.By  Jan. 2012 there were 3,343,000 online accounts of the exhibition; the  first hundred I saw seemed to be merely publicity. I have not tried very  hard—indeed scarcely at all—to find reviews, both because the vast  majority of them simply recycle publicity handouts from the museum and  because I can’t read Cyrillic script.

A reading of the poem; Blake “manifests three binary  oppositions: life instinct versus death instinct, sick culture versus  free fighter, and the world of innocence versus the world of  experience.” “In this imbalance of the binary opposition, the former is  destined to be eroded, slaughtered, and replaced by the latter.”

Translating Blake’s Jerusalem into Polish
         
By Eliza Borkowska
         
Eliza Borkowska (eborkowska@swps.edu.pl) is assistant professor of English at the University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Warsaw. She is the author of But He Talked of the Temple of Man’s Body. Blake’s Revelation Un-Locked (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009) and is currently completing work on her second book, In the Presence of the Absence: Wordsworth’s Encounters with God. She also works as a translator and a scriptwriter.

     
            
A notice in the online news section of Blake in September 2011 informed about an in-progress translation of Jerusalem into Polish by Rafał Stankiewicz and me. Going against the Polish tradition (which has by now become a habit) of publishing Jerusalem  only in the form of selected fragments, we desire to present to the  Polish-speaking public the entire “golden string,” giving this string as  Blakean a gloss as possible and building a Jerusalem that will  be a faithful replica of the original. The purpose of this essay is to  elaborate upon these metaphors. I would like to explain the motivation  behind our project, speak about the obstacles, and share the  encouragements, establishing a context for this testimony of a builder  of a replica with some reflections concerning the history of Polish  Blake translations.
 
It will be fair to begin by stating that  Blake’s name sounds relatively familiar to Polish ears and by  acknowledging that popularizing Blake in Poland has been and remains his  translators’ job.One may object that  perhaps this modest popularity derives partly from the fact that, due to  the political changes of the last decades, more and more Poles know  English. But most of them certainly do not know it well enough to cope  with poetry, and those who do have invested their time and money in  learning English for social and economic reasons, very often in order to  obtain jobs that leave them no time for poetry. More often than not,  genuine poetry readers begin with translations. It is acquaintance with a  Polish version, sometimes a variety of Polish versions, that eventually  provokes those readers who have some command of English to reach for  the original text, to confront the challenge that faced the translators.  Over the decades, Blake’s poetry has attracted many Polish people of  talent, including poets of the highest esteem, such as Leopold Staff,  Jan Kasprowicz, Czesław Miłosz, Zygmunt Kubiak, and Stanisław Barańczak.  Their translations have been published in  anthologies (of English poetry, or English and American poetry, or  romantic poetry, or religious poetry) as well as in volumes dedicated to  Blake alone.For details, see references  under Krzeczkowski et al., Miłosz, Pietrkiewicz, Kubiak (1991 and  1993), Barańczak (1992 and 1993), Puławski, and Fostowicz (1998 and  2007). As a result, a great number of works have been given Polish versions.
 
	In fact, some of Blake’s works have received more than one version. This applies particularly to shorter pieces, including Poetical Sketches and Songs of Innocence and of Experience, as well as several minor prophecies, such as The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, The Book of Thel, and The First Book of Urizen. A similar profusion of translations has been generated by selected passages from Blake’s major prophecies. The most notable example is the preface to Milton (pl. 1).Plate numbers and quotations from Blake’s works follow Erdman, unless otherwise indicated.  In the anthology edited by Puławski (1997), the preface, translated by  Jolanta Kozak, is followed by her translations of pls. 2-4 (144-55),  and, curiously enough, preceded by another version of “And did those  feet …” (143), by Puławski himself. In other words, in an anthology which gives no samples of The Four Zoas or Jerusalem,The lack of any passage representing Jerusalem  is particularly striking in this anthology, as its introduction begins  with a reference to the work: the first sentence states, “In his Jerusalem,  Blake writes the words that could be regarded as a motto for his entire  work: ‘I must Create a System, or be enslav’d by another Mans’” (5; my  translation of the Polish text).  and only a very brief sample of Milton,  there are two translations of the preface’s famous lyric. The same is  true of Kubiak’s anthology (1991), which gives no passages from The Four Zoas or Jerusalem and no extracts from Milton,  with the exception of “And did those feet …” (147). Again, the lyric,  along with the rest of the preface, is the only extract from Milton  included in a more recent selection from Blake’s poems and writings,  compiled and translated by Polish artist and Blake scholar Michał  Fostowicz (87-88 [2007]). 
 
The situation of Milton changed radically in 2001, when  Wiesław Juszczak, one of the most distinguished Polish critics and Blake  scholars, published his translation of the whole prophecy. It is a  brilliant work, though it has one questionable feature: Juszczak seems  to have attempted to render Blake’s sublime and pathos by imitating the  style of one of the leading Polish romantic poets, Juliusz Słowacki. The  result is that the Polish Milton sounds more like  Słowacki than Blake, though this weak point may also be seen as a strong  point: it refers the reader to the epoch when the original was created  and, apart from that, it constitutes an integrated stylistic choice,  whose greatest appeal is its beauty. However, no matter how one assesses  the content and form of Juszczak’s translation, the very fact that he  decided to translate and publish the entire work cannot be  overestimated. It has value in itself, because every post-Juszczak  translator of a fragment from Milton is no longer involved in  the fragmentation of the prophecy. After Juszczak, a new translation of a  fragment (such as Fostowicz’s version of the preface from 2007) becomes  simply a new example of how Milton’s idiom can be rendered; it enriches the ways in which Blake can be naturalized into Polish without disintegrating his thought.
 
The same applies to The Four Zoas, which was translated and  published in its entirety in 2006 by one of the most respected Polish  translators, Maciej Słomczyński (who had earlier translated, among other  things, all the theatrical works of Shakespeare, Milton’s Paradise Lost, and Joyce’s Ulysses).  Again, with the entire text available in Polish, publication of  fragments, such as the selection offered by Fostowicz in 2007 (68-85),  no longer means that the translator carries on the work of  fragmentation. His work becomes a new instance of how individual phrases  or paragraphs or pages could or should be understood. In brief,  publication of a translation of the whole opens up a field for  debate. 
 
Unfortunately, no such field has been opened up to now as far as Jerusalem is  concerned. No interpretative or artistic dialogue relating to what  Blake called his  “consolidated” work is possible, because it  exists in Polish only in the form of pathetically disheveled fragments.  Probably the first poet to publish a translation of a fragment was  Kubiak, whose version of pls. 34[38].7-35[39].3 was included in Poeci języka angielskiego [Poets of the English Language]  (Krzeczkowski et al. 151-54 [1971]). Miłosz, the first Polish poet to  receive the Nobel Prize for Literature (1980), included a large part of  “To the Christians” in his volume of translations entitled Mowa wiązana [Poetic Speech] (1986). The last decade was a little more favorable for Jerusalem (though not as constructive as it was for Blake’s other major prophecies), especially thanks to Fostowicz, who included in his Wiersze i pisma Williama Blake’a [Poems and Writings of William Blake]  (2007) the largest selection so far: pls. 1, 3, 10.7-15.20, 16.61-69,  27, 38[43].1-54, 42.19-46, 52, 70.1-71.9, 74.1-13, 77 (in its entirety),  84.29-85.13, 90.1-91.30, and 94.1-99.5 (90-136).
 
Apart from this, dozens or indeed hundreds of lines have been  translated to illustrate books about Blake written in or translated into  Polish. During the last, most fruitful decade, a great number of minute  quotations from Jerusalem were included in Fostowicz’s latest (and last) book, Boska analogia [Divine Analogy] (2008); more than fifty percent coincide with those selected for his Wiersze i pisma Williama Blake’a,  published a year earlier, while the rest are translations of other bits  and pieces from the prophecy. More fragments, or sometimes other  translations of the same fragments, can be found in a massive book  published in 2001, U‑bywać. Człowiek, świat, przyjaźń w twórczości Williama Blake’a [The Man, the World, and Friendship in the Work of William Blake],The main title, U‑bywać, is a pun suggesting contact with others (bywać u) as a means of the annihilation of the self (ubywać).  by probably the most recognizable Polish Blake scholar,  Tadeusz Sławek. Another group appears in one of the very few  translations of Blake-related books into Polish, Peter Ackroyd’s Blake,  which was translated by Ewa Kraskowska and published in 2001. To read  these fragments is the most disheartening of experiences. In choosing  extracts for his Blake anthology, Fostowicz could at least claim that he  “tried to select key … fragments of bigger wholes [including Jerusalem]  and put them together in a way that will make it possible for the  uninitiated to understand the basic ideas [of Blake’s thought] and walk  efficiently along his labyrinth” (foreword, p. 5 [2007]; translation  mine). But, understandably, no such claims can be made in his Boska analogia or any other critical book; the fragments are of course random, they follow the critic’s argument, not Jerusalem’s,  and they are, naturally, meant to guide the reader along Fostowicz’s,  or Sławek’s, or Ackroyd’s labyrinth, not Blake’s. 
 
One of the outcomes of this situation is that Blake’s thought gets  explained for the Polish reader without the reader’s having any real  chance to know Blake himself. Another is the false impression that the  reader may derive from encountering Jerusalem in the form of a  disorganized mass. Now and then, for example, the reader will find in  this jumble of fragments quotations saying that “Jerusalem lies in  ruins,” and indeed there is nothing to counteract the impression that  she/it really does. A third consequence is that no tradition of  translating Jerusalem into Polish has a chance of taking root  in such ground. A telling illustration is Kraskowska’s translation of  Ackroyd. Undertaking the rare job of translating rather than writing a  Blake-related book, she uses translations that existed at the time,  quoting, for example, Kubiak’s translations of fragments of “To the  Evening Star” (68), An Island in the Moon (105), and The Book of Thel (134), as well as the entire “The Chimney Sweeper” of Innocence (143) and all of “The Tyger” (168),A  curious detail is that Kraskowska does not limit herself to one  translation of the poem, quoted by Ackroyd at the beginning of chapter  14, but provides as many as four (168-69): Kubiak’s version is followed  by Barańczak’s, and then by two translations from Puławski’s anthology,  one by Puławski and the other by Kozak. available in Kubiak’s anthologies of 1991 and 1993. As I said above, Kubiak also translated pls. 34[38].7-35[39].3 of Jerusalem,  from which Ackroyd quotes several times. Yet this time the translator  does not use Kubiak but translates the lines she needs herself, probably  because the passage, for some reason not included in Kubiak’s  anthologies from the 1990s, exists only in the form of a disconnected  fragment in Poeci języka angielskiego of 1971 (Krzeczkowski et  al. 151-54) and is too short for her to bother to recover the  translation. If the translation of Ackroyd’s book were made now, ten  years later, the translator would be in a much more comfortable  position; apart from the shorter pieces which were available in 2001,  she would have the entire text of Milton and The Four Zoas to take from. But as far as Jerusalem is concerned, she would probably take the passages collected by Fostowicz in his Wiersze i pisma Williama Blake’a and translate all the other passages herself, rather than scan Fostowicz’s critical Boska analogia (which, by the way, provides translations of much higher quality than those in his anthology of 2007) or U‑bywać  by Sławek (a hugely competent Blake scholar and a poet to boot) in the  hope that, perhaps, there is some coincidence in the fragments that a  Polish critic and the English author needed to illustrate their  arguments.
 
All in all, putting together the fragments scattered in selections  from Blake and in Blake criticism, well over a thousand lines of Jerusalem  have been translated into Polish, about a quarter of the text (roughly  the equivalent of one chapter). Some lines have been translated more  than once, and thousands have never been translated. Having invested  several years in the task of creating the first Polish translation of  the entire prophecy along with Rafał Stankiewicz—a Polish poet and  philologist, and a devoted Blake student—I could provide a long  catalogue of challenges, very often frustrations, on the translator’s  way. But let me limit myself to a handful of examples. 
 
Polish words tend to be longer than English. For instance, Life,  Love, Good, Hate, Form, Wheel, Shell, Void, Space, Earth, Sun, Moon,  Man, Heart, Womb, One, Lamb, and hundreds of other one-syllable keywords  of Jerusalem are two- or three-syllable words in Polish, and  in certain grammatical cases or in the plural they often become three or  even four syllables. This is, of course, bad for the rhythmicality of  the text, and it is even worse for its length. As a result, though the  translator must repeat after Blake the assertions of “To the Public”  concerning the “cadences” and “number of syllables,” there is very  little chance that there will be correspondence between the original and  the translation in this respect. In a different text you might consider  removing individual words for the sake of rhythm and brevity, but you  dare not do this in a text that, in the same paragraph of “To the  Public,” asserts that “every word and every letter is studied and put  into its fit place.” You can likewise experiment with synonyms,  searching for a Polish word whose rhythm and length will be nearer the  English original. But it is exactly when you start doing this that you  appreciate how direct Blake is in his choice of vocabulary. He is not  Milton, he does not rely on Latinate diction or rhetoric; his words  cannot be translated with the use of less obvious synonyms, with  something of foreign derivation, or something slightly more archaic.  Once this is done what gets affected is the most vital feature of the  original: its directness, its fiery energy, its elemental power.
 
Even more crucially, the rhythm—the palpable beat of English, its  play between the strong and the weak, the stressed and the unstressed—is  an attribute that does not have an equivalent in Polish. The Polish  language has stressed and unstressed syllables, but what is stressed is  not that strong, what is unstressed not so weak and, as a result, even  if the translator manages to recreate the rhythm, it will never attack  the Polish ear as much as the original attacks the English ear. Of  course these difficulties confront every translator of English verse  into Polish, but the specific difficulty of Jerusalem is that  the beat is part of the meaning. Los is a blacksmith, his sense is the  ear, his tool is the hammer (“The blow of his Hammer is Justice. the  swing of his Hammer: Mercy. / The force of Los’s Hammer is eternal  Forgiveness,” 88.49-50). When a fragment is translated, it is not as  obvious as when the whole is approached that one of the works of this  hammer is Jerusalem itself, and that its beat must be heard  throughout. Los would be as effective and efficient in Polish as he is  in English if his instrument were one of the harps to which he is  singing in The Song of Los, or if he went on singing the cradle  song, or the watch song, or if he limited himself to operating the plow  and running the winepress, or if he were an engraver drawing lines  “upon the walls of shining heaven.” As a smith, Polish Los must remain  inferior to the English original, because there is less force in the  swing and the blow of his hammer.
 
Moreover, Blake’s punctuation causes immense difficulty. For example, Erdman’s pl. 16.3-7 reads: 

                                                                                     in the Forests The Oak frowns terrible, the Beech and Ash and Elm enroot  Among the Spiritual fires; loud the Corn fields thunder along The Soldiers fife; the Harlots shriek; the Virgins dismal groan The Parents fear: the Brothers jealousy: the Sisters curse ….
 Should these lines be interpreted like this, 
                                                                                     in the Forests The Oak frowns terrible, the Beech and Ash and Elm enroot Among the Spiritual fires; loud the Corn fields thunder along.  The Soldiers fife, the Harlots shriek, the Virgins dismal groan, The Parents fear the Brother’s jealousy, the Sister’s curse ….
 or, perhaps, in the following way? 
                                                                                     in the Forests The Oak frowns terrible, the Beech and Ash and Elm enroot Among the Spiritual fires; loud the Corn fields thunder along The Soldier’s fife, the Harlot’s shriek, the Virgin’s dismal groan, The Parent’s fear, the Brother’s jealousy, the Sister’s curse ….
 As a Blake scholar, I have always found Blake’s punctuation not really  erratic, as it has so often been named (or, indeed, misnamed), but  polyphonic. For this reason, as a critic, I rely on Erdman’s edition,  because only in this edition is it possible to get what Blake’s original  really offers: to see, for example, not only “the Parents fear” but  also “the Parent’s fear” and “the Parents’ fear.” But the critic’s  exhilaration becomes the translator’s frustration. Where the critic has  the freedom to enjoy the activity and passivity, singularity and  plurality combined into one brief phrase, the translator must constantly  consult Keynes, Stevenson, Paley, or Solomon for their opinions and  then reduce the original’s multitude and polyvocality, because certain  reductions must be made: Polish, being a flectional language, has cases,  and its genitive sounds totally different from its plural; it has no  coincidence of verb and noun, etc. The only thing the translator can do  is make a decision and follow one line of interpretation, and then,  perhaps, account for the reduction in poetry in the prose of a footnote. 
Of course, this type of frustration is also the experience of Blake’s  editors. What remains the vexation of the translator alone is the need  to make certain indeterminacies determinate. To provide another—the  last—illustration: on pl. 14.16-20, Blake writes: 

And Los beheld his Sons, and he beheld his Daughters: Every one a translucent Wonder: a Universe within, Increasing inwards …                            … and they every one in their bright loins: Have a beautiful golden gate ….
 Does “every one” refer to the daughters and sons of Los, or to the  daughters alone? This interpretative decision must be made because all  possible Polish equivalents of “every one” will take one form when they  refer to females alone, and another when they refer to a female-male  group. Blake’s editors are of no help in this case, because they do not  need to decide. Here, critics and commentators must become the  translator’s guides, and the frustration comes when you need to weigh,  for example, Paley’s and Doskow’s opinions (that the lines refer to the  sons and daughters) versus Stevenson’s and Damon’s (that they refer to the daughters alone).See Paley, William Blake 152, Doskow 56, Stevenson 686 (note to 14.16-24), and Damon 244.  Even more frustration comes when the only conclusion you can draw from  reading and rereading Damon, Paley, Wicksteed, Dortort, Curran and  Wittreich, Otto, Bloom, Doskow, Beer, and others is that nobody says  anything about a given line or phrase or word. Of course, there is  nothing surprising about it; there are hundreds of lines that have never  received an illuminating commentary because, quite understandably,  scholars focus on what is vital for their arguments. The difference  between a critic and a translator is that for the latter each word,  every minute particular, is vital. 
Nevertheless, despite these and hundreds of other difficulties, the  frustration turns back to exhilaration when it transpires that, after  all, Blake’s thought does yield to the Polish language. Juszczak and  Słomczyński have demonstrated how effectively the type of difficulties  enumerated above can be overcome and how vivid and suggestive, full of  sublimity and pathos “Polish Blake” can be. Though the language does not  have certain features which constitute the English language’s  specificity and appeal, it does have attractions of its own, in  particular immense musicality, flexibility, and openness to syntactic  and semantic experiment. Perhaps the lines must remain slightly longer,  but assonance, for example, by the vocal association of one word with  another, will make them feel shorter. The modulation of Polish does not  resemble the modulation of English, yet it makes a music of its own. The  hammer of Los may need to become a slightly more musical hammer in the  hand of a slightly more musical smith, yet it is capable of beating out a  rhythm which pulsates powerfully enough to make the whole vibrant and  energetic, fiery and passionate.
 
Still, despite this, Jerusalem exists only in the form of  fragments. Poles have had no chance to wind the “golden string” into a  ball, because the string is badly torn. Symptomatically, when  translating pl. 77 (“To the Christians”), Miłosz started from “I know of  no other Christianity”; in other words, he excluded the “golden string”  motto, probably because it makes no sense when only a fragment is  given. Fostowicz, on the other hand, did translate the motto along with  the rest of the plate, but he made what seems a deliberate mistake by  changing the tense; in his translation (as well as in the first  paragraph of his foreword, where he quotes the “golden string” piece  again), the motto reads not “I give you the end of a golden string” but  “I will give you the end of a golden string” (5, 118 [2007]).
 
Although Fostowicz changed the original’s present tense into the  future, it is quite doubtful, however, whether he really planned to give  his audience the entire golden string sometime in the future. Before  his death in 2010, he had conducted extensive correspondence with my  collaborator, Rafał Stankiewicz. Fostowicz discussed every question and  uncertainty with the fire of an artist and the patience of a scholar,  yet never offered to join the project. Of course, one of his reasons  might have been his involvement with other projects, including writing  his massive Boska analogia. But another possible reason why he  was not willing to engage in translating the entire text and why he  chose to publish fragments rather than working on the whole may be  recovered from a careful examination of the selection he offers in Wiersze i pisma Williama Blake’a.
 
He begins with the frontispiece, pl. 1, which is duly followed by pl.  3, “To the Public.” Pl. 3, however, is not followed by pls. 4 and 5,  etc., but by pls. 10.7-15.20, which he puts together under the title  “Golgonooza.” As noted, Fostowicz claims in the first paragraph of his  foreword that he “tried to select key … fragments of bigger wholes and  put them together in a way that will make it possible for the  uninitiated to understand the basic ideas [of Blake’s thought] and walk  efficiently along his labyrinth” (5). The question that arises is why  the translator who wanted to acquaint his reader with Blake’s “basic  ideas” excluded the theme of Jerusalem, given in the opening of  pl. 4. Even more importantly, why did he exclude the statement of  Blake’s great task (“To open the Eternal Worlds, to open the immortal  Eyes / Of Man …”) in pl. 5, which explains everything that follows,  including Golgonooza? My guess is that Fostowicz’s intuition told him  that what qualifies as a fair selection, fit to be offered to the Polish  reader, are fragments which are not over-English.
 
Jerusalem’s theme is specified in pl. 4, which is quite  heavily loaded with English and Welsh place-names (“The Malvern and the  Cheviot, the Wolds Plinlimmon and Snowdon,” etc.). Even more  radically, Blake’s great task is formulated in a paragraph that  incorporates the list of the sons of Albion (“While I write of the  building of Golgonooza, and of the terrors of Entuthon: / Of Hand  and Hyle and Coban, of Kwantok, Peachey, Brereton, Slayd and  Hutton”), which is followed by a list of four other sons (“Scofield!  Kox, Kotope and Bowen”), and then by the catalogue of Albion’s daughters  (5.41-45). By contrast, in 10.7-15.20, the longest uninterrupted  passage in Fostowicz’s selection, there are only a handful of references  to the individual sons and daughters (Sabrina and Ignoge in 11.19,  Ragan and Scofield in 11.21, and Hand, Hyle, and Skofeld in 15.1-2).  What is more, in this passage of 276 lines, London is the only  conspicuous English place-name; apart from London, there are just brief  references to Tyburn, Paddington, and Lambeth in the description of the  building of Golgonooza.
 
To give a few more examples, this passage is followed by a pitifully  brief extract (16.61-69), which the translator entitles “Los’s Halls.”  Significantly, what is omitted is the highly English remainder of pl.  16, which begins “Hampstead Highgate Finchley Hendon Muswell hill” and  then, after Humber and Trent, Tweed and Tyne, along with Lincolnshire,  Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Oxfordshire, and Norfolk,  progresses to the enumeration of the counties of Wales, England, and  Scotland. This elimination of the better part of the plate and the  decision to give only its concluding paragraph as a fragment seem to be  dictated by the same rationale that informs other choices and  selections. Thus, the preface “To the Deists,” pl. 52, is followed by  what Fostowicz calls “Plates 70-71.” The heading is misleading, however,  as only the first nine lines of pl. 71 are given, and the thoroughly  English remainder, beginning “And these the Names of Albions Twelve  Sons, and of his Twelve Daughters / With their Districts,” is not  translated. Pls. 94-99, on the other hand, are translated, and form the  second-longest uninterrupted passage of Jerusalem in  Fostowicz’s anthology. In this passage of 176 lines, there is just one  line that has English place-names (“Cornwall and Derbyshire” in 94.8),  and the sons and daughters of Albion are referred to only as a group.  Preceding this relatively long extract is a passage entitled “Los’s  Lament,” pls. 90.1-91.30. Pl. 90, translated in its entirety, is more  English than most of the other passages in this selection. Among other  things, line 40 contains a reference to four sons of Albion: “While in  Selfhood Hand and Hyle and Bowen and Skofeld appropriate / The  Divine Names.” In Fostowicz’s translation, however, four become three,  as he removes Bowen—a faithful translator for no apparent reason omits  one of the four: “Samozapatrzenie w postaci Handa, Hyle’a i Skofelda …”  (“Selfhood in the form of Hand, Hyle, and Skofeld …”; translation mine).  One last telling detail is that a Blake dictionary that Fostowicz  provides at the end of his book (287-97), while explaining the important  places and characters of Blake’s myth—Allamanda, Beulah, Cathedron,  Entuthon-Benython, Erin, Luban, Ahania, Bromion, Enion,  Fuzon,  Leutha, Oothoon, Orc, Palamabron, Rintrah, Theotormon, and many  others—contains only Albion, Hand, Scofield, and Tyburn for English  proper names. In other words, the selection from Jerusalem has been made in such a way that there is no need to explain any other English names.
 
In sum, a study of the most extensive collection of fragments from Jerusalem  translated into Polish so far, particularly the logic behind what has  been selected and what has been excluded, leads to the conclusion that Jerusalem  might have been considered too English to be translated as a whole.  Indeed, certain passages, such as the fixing of the counties in pl. 16,  cannot be effectively naturalized into Polish. The way that Blake  translates the map of the British Isles into rhythmic verse will never  have the same effect on the Polish audience as it has on the British,  because the names will remain largely unknown and because the ear of a  Polish person who does not know English will not catch the rhythm  (reading, for example, “-shire” not as a one-syllable but as a  two-syllable word). The eye of a Polish reader, even one quite well  acquainted with English, may spot the missing “w” in “Glasgo” in 16.57,  but will probably not grasp all the other abbreviations that give this  incantation the feel of a dictation hastily put down in shorthand. This  may be explained in a footnote, but too many footnotes usually lead to a  situation where none is read, which means in effect that a Polish  person seeing the missing “w” in “Glasgo” will regard it as an editorial  mistake.
 
On the other hand, similar catalogues are part of the biblical and of  the epic conventions, which are as familiar to the educated Polish  reader as to anybody. The reader will probably not grasp the specificity  of Blake’s catalogue, but will understand enough to accept it as part  of the entire prophecy. Besides, the proportion of such lines is so tiny  that the text does not deserve to be fragmented only to spare the  reader the difficulty of coping with such passages. In fact, the key to Jerusalem’s characters and places is largely to be found in Jerusalem itself; Damon’s A Blake Dictionary  is, for the most part, a collection of quotations from Blake himself,  both when it explains purely Blakean terms and when it defines Blake’s  use of the names “Hand and Hyle and Bowen and Skofeld,” etc. Then  again, the names Cambel or Gwinefred, when heard for the first time,  probably sound as empty to the ear of an English reader as they do to  the Polish reader. Gwiniverra, on the other hand, sounds familiar  (Hollywood productions know no national, cultural, or linguistic  borders), and so do the names of Cordella, Gonorill, and Ragan  (fortunately, Shakespeare knows no borders either). Thus, the first  encounter with those characters may not be as perplexing for the reader  as one might fear, and with each and every subsequent appearance of the  daughters of Albion it becomes apparent that familiarity with the  Arthurian romance or with King Lear does not offer much help in understanding their functions in Jerusalem,  because they assume a narrative life of their own, they become part of  the myth, very much like Ahania, Enion, Vala, or Enitharmon, or like Milton in Milton.Actually Milton,  which has been translated into Polish, requires much more background.  To understand what Blake’s Milton does and says presupposes acquaintance  with John Milton’s thought, attitude, and religious convictions, as  well as with the style of Paradise Lost. But what Blake’s daughters of Albion say and do in Jerusalem will be perfectly understood without any acquaintance with Milton’s History of Britain, one of the sources from which Blake derived their names. As a matter of fact, it is only if Jerusalem  is offered as a whole that it can explain why it contains such a  multitude of English references. It is only when it is allowed to tell  its narrative that it can reveal that, on one level, the record of Los’s  fight for his friend Albion is a record of Blake’s artistic fight for  the country and the culture in which he lived and worked. And only when Jerusalem  is allowed to unwind its story without interruption does it have a  chance to disclose that, on another level, Los’s fight is universal,  Blake’s Albion, the sleeping giant, is an Everyman, and, despite the  multitude of English place-names, Albion is an everywhere, very much  like Joyce’s apparently (and literally) thoroughly Irish Dublin.
 
In brief, my conviction is that Jerusalem seems much more  confined within British culture, history, and geography when it is  fragmented than when it is a “consolidated” work. A fragment that may be  considered untranslatable becomes translatable when it stops being a  fragment and has a chance to function as part of the whole.
 
Will Polish people take up the challenge that Blake’s Jerusalem  offers? Of course I hope they will. However, hoping is a dubious thing  in Polish; we do have an equivalent of the English “while there’s life  there’s hope,” but there is also a nasty Polish proverb that says “hope  is the mother of fools.” Let me therefore conclude not on what I hope  for but on what I know: it is impossible to determine whether Poles will  take up the challenge of Jerusalem until the challenge of the entire text is offered.

This book is an intellectual and critical gem that is also a great  bargain. As an edition of a classic collection of challenging poems for  use by serious but not necessarily expert readers, it is as successful  as Stephen Booth’s classic facsimile and critical edition of Shakespeare’s Sonnets  (Yale, 1977). Essick provides a foundation of perspicacious  historicist/materialist contextual and critical analysis, drawing upon  (without getting bogged down in) more than two centuries of Blake  scholarship; the critical apparatus as a whole promotes a sophisticated  appreciation of the contrary states of the human soul while gently  steering modern readers, innocent and experienced, around the  accumulated obstacles to subtle understanding of these poems and their  illuminations.  
 
The edition begins with full-size color reproductions of all but one  of the pages now present in the Huntington Library’s handsome copy E of Songs, which  Blake assembled for Thomas Butts from leaves printed at various times  in various colored printing inks, plus three additional pages: “The  Clod and the Pebble,” from the Huntington’s copy N (substituting for  the crudely finished posthumous impression of this plate that was added  to copy E), the uncolored “A Divine Image” (actually present only in  copy BB), and the tailpiece from copy C, a page omitted from all but a  few early copies of Songs. The recto/verso printing of the  pages Blake had at hand when he assembled copy E entailed some further  compromises on his part—“Laughing Song” appears in both Innocence and Experience, and the “Nurses Song” in Experience is effectively salvaged from an accidental double impression in order to make use of the print on the opposite side.
 
As facsimiles of Blake’s pages the reproductions are not completely  successful: the original pages of copy E are matte, for one thing, and  these reproductions are all printed on glossy paper, with what appears  to be a glossier finish on top (or perhaps just glossy ink). In a note  of corrigenda (Blake 42.3 [winter 2008-09]: 111), Essick  acknowledges that despite elaborate measures by the imaging and printing  team, the reproductions do not accurately represent the tone of the  paper on which Blake’s images were printed—the background is “too brown,  with a slight rosy hue,” with a result that is occasionally reminiscent  of what used to be called flesh-colored bandages. The only page on  which the tone of the paper is accurate, reports Essick, is “The Tyger,”  which is unfortunate in another way, since in that case the original  background has been sunned so badly that the paper tone in the glossy  reproduction approximates a varnished stationer’s bag; I think it would  have been forgivable in a non-archival facsimile like this one to have  manipulated the image digitally to undo or at least minimize the sun  damage, which has as little to do with Blake’s intentions for copy E as  the posthumous “Clod and the Pebble” leaf that Essick judiciously  replaced. 
 
Despite these problems, the colors of Blake’s images appear to be  considerably truer here than in most reproductions by offset  lithography, and the details are very sharp; I have not seen these  reproductions side by side with the originals, but they look right.   Copy E is a fine middle-period copy, despite its somewhat heterogeneous  constituents, and its rough edges reveal things about Blake’s publishing  and printing that are obscured by more polished copies. Further, it is  good to have printed images of its pages to compare with those of  better-known, more elaborate late copies such as Z (Library of Congress;  Blake Trust/Orion/Oxford) or W (King’s College; Princeton/Blake Trust).  The luminous, zoomable digital images of most copies in the William Blake Archive http://www.blakearchive.org  are both magnificent and immensely useful, but there’s still a place  for reading and comparing paper-based images of Blake’s works. Indeed,  this facsimile is much more successful in one respect than most Songs  editions in color: Blake’s careful reinforcement in ink of many of the  original printed texts in this copy and the overall sharpness of the  images in this edition make it possible to read almost all the poems in  the facsimile pages with only a little strain, so that readers can  experience text and image together, as Essick recommends and Blake  intended.
 
The general introduction efficiently and clearly covers the  potentially controversial matter of Blake’s unique publishing techniques  without gratuitously venturing into the disputed territory that lies  there, outlines the intellectual and historical contexts that are most  relevant, and locates in Blake’s biography the distinguishable but  overlapping projects of writing, printing, and issuing the copies of the  Songs as finished works.  A general account of the development of the Innocence  poems follows, once again placing them in broad cultural and historical  contexts and then more immediate ones.  Essick outlines the rhetoric  and ideology of Innocence and then explains the complex binary of  Innocence and Experience that emerged from the original project: "just  as Blake’s innocence is not heaven, or even Eden, his state of  experience is not hell. Both are visions of our own world seen from  fundamentally different yet interconnected perspectives. Experience  reverses or parodies (in a non-comic fashion) the core habits of mind  and themes of its contrary state” (16).
 
The commentaries upon the individual poems address both illustrations  and text efficiently and fairly thoroughly, thoroughly enough that when  this edition first appeared I was a little reluctant to use it with  beginning readers of Blake. I worried that such comprehensive and  authoritative discussion of the major issues in each poem would leave  little for students to discover for themselves.  Instead, the commentary  usually has the opposite effect; far from being inhibited by Essick’s  impressively learned guidance, students respond to the lucidity and  cogency of his readings with lucid, cogent insights of their own. The  great David V. Erdman’s The Illuminated Blake  (Anchor–Doubleday, 1974), by contrast, is even more thorough in its own  way, and even more open-ended in its analysis, but when students emulate  it they tend to absorb its weaknesses rather than its strengths,  confounding stray minutiae with minute particulars.
 



Frontispiece of Aphorisms on Man, 2nd ed. (author’s collection).

In  general this edition is more oriented toward literary than visual-arts  interests. Although Essick’s knowledge of Blake’s art-historical  contexts rivals that of anyone in the business, he is more likely to  adduce an extra-Blakean text in his commentary than a picture by another  artist. I teach Blake to art and design students, who need to know  about literary analogues as much as anyone, but they engage Blake’s  composite art most energetically when they see, for instance, the  frontispiece to Innocence (and consider its poetic “Introduction”) in conjunction with Blake’s 1788 engraving after Fuseli for Lavater’s Aphorisms on Man.  It may be, however, that the critical apparatus that would be necessary  to help less visually oriented readers to negotiate the pictorial  languages of the Songs would be so voluminous as to be  impractical. As it is, reference to specific contextual material of all  kinds is limited, and the literary analogues that are quoted tend to be  texts that enlighten readers in relatively straightforward ways: thus  Wesley’s hymn for children “Gentle Jesus, Meek and Mild” is cited in the  discussion of “The Lamb,” but Matthew Prior’s “A True Maid,” in which  leering Dick inquires about the health of a young woman named Rose, is  not mentioned in connection with “The Sick Rose,” though it is strongly  (if rather obliquely) resonant with it and as surely known to both Blake  and much of his original audience as Wesley’s hymn. 
The typographic texts that accompany each commentary are, at least  theoretically, punctuated (and paginated) as in the pages reproduced.  Some might argue that rigorous adherence to the punctuational vagaries  of this particular copy is inappropriate in an edition intended for  general readers, since the marks that appear in this copy are so  unconventional that they provide little help for those having trouble  parsing Blake’s poetic diction, and the unique punctuation of copy E  does not appear to reflect concerted authorial intention. In this  instance I believe that Essick is correct in minimizing intervention. An  editor of an illuminated Blake text who supplies punctuation along  conventional lines risks obscuring ambiguities that students can  fruitfully explore, and in an edition of a particular copy of a  particular illuminated book there is little point in concocting a  super-text based on principled extrapolation from all copies, as Erdman  did in his editions of the poetry and prose. Essick sensibly follows the  practice of the Blake Archive, which aspires to reproduce and  transcribe all copies of the illuminated books in all their individuated  multifariousness.  
 
If the textual principle here corresponds to that of the archive, the  practice diverges—even not intervening, it turns out, can take  different paths and present thorny difficulties. Essick’s transcriptions  differ in small ways from both those of the archive and, by my eyes,  from the text as it appears in copy E. For instance, Essick’s  transcription of “Infant Joy” omits the clearly formed if textually  ambiguous dash-oids that the archive includes at the end of lines 2 and  5, a decision unremarked in the textual notes. Because the pen-and-ink  reinforcement of the printed texts in Songs E often goes beyond  touching up to complete rewriting, it could be argued that the  generally sparser punctuation in writing ink is more deliberate than the  printed punctuation, which Blake often left so faint, as in “The  Tyger,” that for reading purposes it isn’t there. But even Blake’s very  deliberate-looking repunctuation in ink isn’t consistently more  conventional or helpful than what it replaces, as in line 17 of the  “Introduction” to Innocence, where a clearly printed comma is  overwritten with a clear, and clearly unconventional, period in ink. In  the end, though, I’m not sure it would have been very edifying if Essick  had explained and adjudicated every punctuational crux that the text  presents: his transcriptions are helpful and careful, and the  reproductions of the pages are clear enough that readers can see for  themselves how complex Blake’s punctuation can be.
 
If it should come to pass that the Huntington Library decides to  offer a second edition of this fine book, I am not sure what I would  recommend changing. The sturdy-seeming sewn hardcover costs only a few  dollars more than the blurry paperback edition of copy Z now offered by  Oxford, so a less expensive binding isn’t particularly pressing, even  for classroom use (I am very taken with the double bookmark ribbons, one  for Innocence and one for Experience, or one for  image and one for commentary).  I would like to see the imaging and  printing experts take another stab at rendering the background color of  most pages more correctly, and tweaking “The Tyger” to lose its  Hollywood tan, but I suspect that changing to a less glossy paper would  endanger the accuracy of the color and the clarity that make this  edition so satisfactory for reading. Let’s just hope it stays in print  for a long time, in any form.

Reviewed by Grant F. Scott
         
Grant F. Scott (scott@muhlenberg.edu) is professor and chair of English at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania. He is the author of The Sculpted Word: Keats, Ekphrasis, and the Visual Arts (1994), editor of Joseph Severn: Letters and Memoirs (2005) and, most recently, co-editor with Sue Brown of New Letters from Charles Brown to Joseph Severn (Romantic Circles  electronic edition, rev. 2010). He is currently working on a scholarly  edition of the illustrated letters of Richard Doyle to his father,  1842-43.

         
         
This book is more about the social function of Blake’s art in  a number of physical and personal economies than it is about the art  itself. Haggarty examines the idea of the gift as well as related ideas  about spiritual exchange in selected passages from a few poems—mostly Jerusalem and Milton—but  the predominant focus remains the social network of Blake’s friends and  patrons and the larger cultural matrix that governed the etiquette of  giving in the eighteenth century. As such the primary texts are Blake’s  letters, annotations, and Descriptive Catalogue. The secondary  texts are myriad, though Bourdieu, Derrida, and Marcel Mauss frame the  most significant discussions and Mee and Makdisi plug the interstices.  In addition, a teeming hive of contemporary characters like Duff and  Hayley, Reynolds and Robinson swarm these pages and at times push Blake  to the margins. 
 
	Haggarty examines gift-giving in five “discursive domains” that  ascend steadily from secular to spiritual: Economy, Patronage, Charity,  Inspiration, and Salvation. Her contention is that gift-giving is not  only a central preoccupation “but a quasi-formal principle” of Blake’s  work (2). Because of his “horror of Money” (20; Crabb Robinson’s  phrase), Blake continually tried to navigate the terrain between the  grubby economy of business and the generosity of the gift, a generosity  based upon forging friendships rather than setting prices, adhering to  contracts, or exacting compensation. The paradoxes and vexations of  Blake’s “intermingling” of these realms form the heart of this book.  Blake’s conception of the gift underwrites “his radical critique of  commerce, polite consensus, self-righteous morality, and Church  doctrine” (2) and is bound closely with his views of reciprocity and  friendship. To the bemusement and often annoyance of his patrons,  Blake’s notion of reciprocity rested on “an exercise of co-operative  antagonism” (3) that often threatened to strain the very ties of the  friendship itself. In the final chapters, Haggarty looks at various  incarnations of the divine gift—the “free gift” and “pure gift,”  including Christ’s sacrificial offering of his life—which disrupt and  complicate both the mercantile contract and the more personal idea of  reciprocity.
 
	The first chapter, “Economy,” analyzes the representation of the  gift in Blake’s letters and annotations and the transaction of his  illuminated books in the world. Blake implies “the incommensurability of  price, debt, and money with human experience,” substituting for the cash nexus his own divinely inflected discourse of “treasures, rewards, gold, talents, and riches”  (12), borrowed of course from the New Testament. In this  transfiguration “treasures” are “gifts that can be exchanged” (12). The  unique production of Blake’s books, his “cottage economy” (Paul Mann’s  term), and the way that individual sales along with the sharing of his  books embody their value constitute more of a social than commercial  form of transaction. “What is particularly interesting about Blake’s  home-studios,” as Haggarty insightfully remarks, “is that, in them,  places of sale are also places of production and, as it were, the work  of consumption. The home-studio is thus, potentially at least, a site of  unalienated exchange” (21). The chapter concludes with a fine analysis  of the architecture and building of Golgonooza in Jerusalem, a passage that intermingles earthly and heavenly details in ways that attest Blake’s practical difficulty with “treasure.”
 
	Exploring the historical role of patronage in a transitional time  and Blake’s experiences with this institution, the second chapter is the  most informative and strongest of the book. Haggarty demonstrates that  patronage was changing in the late eighteenth century, becoming  increasingly, in Dustin Griffin’s phrase, “a site of contestation” (46)  that involved overlapping economies of aristocratic and commercial  culture. In some ways Blake was a throwback to the past in that from the  turn of the century until his death he became almost entirely dependent  for his income on three patrons—Hayley, Butts, and Linnell. On the  other hand, he worked hard to guarantee that these were not exclusively  business partnerships, that he did not compromise his artistic freedom  in these relationships, and that he was intent on “forging, rather than  breaking, the bonds between men” (51). This tightrope act could be  challenging, however, particularly since Blake based so many of his  friendships on the proverb “Opposition is true Friendship.” Haggarty  usefully reveals how Blake negotiated such difficulties in her depiction  of his wily dedication to the Countess of Egremont (1808), in which he  fashions a recusatio that nimbly pirouettes between praise and pride (58-59).
 
	Haggarty outlines the differences between Derrida and Mauss in their  understanding of the gift’s relation to gratitude and suggests that  Blake shares more of an affinity with Mauss’s notion of a gift “at once  free and obligatory” (63). She then applies these ideas to a discussion  of Blake’s volatile relationship with William Hayley and his circle.  Blake plays the game of patronage through subtle expressions of  gratitude in his letters, yet his numerous “eruption[s] of feeling” (72)  and “small acts of resistance” (73) indicate that he was “subtly  contesting the terms of his relationship with Hayley” (72). Blake’s  defiance and indignation at the drudgery of Hayley’s projects ultimately  doomed the relationship, and he broke with his patron in 1805-06. He  could no longer sustain the paradox of being Hayley’s “devoted rebel”  (71). As Haggarty frankly admits, though Blake improvised various forms  of reciprocity and friendship with his patrons, he was never entirely  successful at communicating the idea of a gift as both open and  obligatory—at intertwining friendship and finance or responding promptly  with appropriate expressions of gratitude —and often wound up  qualifying his ideals of “co-operative antagonism” (83) and artistic  freedom.
 
	Blake’s understanding of charity, shown in his annotations to Thornton’s Lord’s Prayer, Newly Translated (1827) and in passages from Milton and Jerusalem,  partly subscribes to, partly resists the constructions of charity in  contemporary writings on religion and political economy. He opposes “the  purification of the gift” (86) and hints that the free gift is always  attached to the economist logic it means to refute. Haggarty examines  Blake’s critique of the free gift in the context of writings on the  voluntarism of almsgiving by Burke, Malthus, Copleston, and Chalmers.  From the problems associated with charity and the free gift, she moves  to Blake’s theory of inspiration, a genuinely pure spiritual gift with  no quid pro quo but a curious relationship with temporal boundaries: “It  disrupts time’s homogenous flow[,] … resists the division and  supervision of labor under industrial capitalism. But it also refuses to  break with the temporal cycle altogether. Inspiration’s ‘Non Existent’  time seems … [to be] the generous present of the ‘Moment’ in Milton”  (113). In both later epics, inspiration defies measure, though it is  never divorced from labor as many of Blake’s contemporaries believed.  “Rather, inspiration and labor arrive together, in the time of the  generous present” (114). 
 
	Haggarty then considers the disparity that H. C. Robinson and others  pointed out between Blake’s claims to divine inspiration and his  working methods, particularly his attention to copying. She argues that  Blake differentiated between a “seeming” copy and a “real” one and  maintains that the latter is more truly like its source (127).   More compellingly, she claims that in his Descriptive Catalogue,  Blake proposed that visionary copying was unmediated and that  “emulating rather than imitating these originals” was the pathway to  genius (129). The balance of the chapter weighs various contradictory  definitions of inspiration in Blake’s writings, setting them against  those of figures such as Plato and Reynolds and arguing, among other  things, that the artist may as readily be “empowered as … dispossessed  by [inspiration’s] eruption” (131). For Blake, inspiration was not  passive, required the reciprocity of labor, and “was as much human as it  was divine” (142). That it could just as easily destabilize or  interrupt the continuity of a work is made clear in plate 3 of Jerusalem,  where, as Haggarty notes, entire passages are “gouged out” (Paley’s  words) or painted over and prominent gaps propel the poem “into ever  increasing discontinuity” (152). Here is evidence of a gift that cannot  be realized in human space or time.
 
	The final chapter, “Salvation,” investigates Blake’s unorthodox  representation of Christ’s “saving gift” (157), his sacrifice of himself  for Albion in Jerusalem.  Haggarty shows how the Bible  and later writings link the doctrine of salvation to sacrifice; how  Blake critiques such figurations in his portrait of a God who manifests  himself through the incarnate Christ in The Book of Urizen; how  Blake sees Christ’s sacrifice as an example that humankind has the  capacity to imitate; and how the image of Christ’s crucifixion and  Albion’s response on plate 76 of Jerusalem both encapsulate and  extend these ideas. Her visual analysis of this plate is instructive,  revealing that in Blake’s image of Christ “it is almost as if the  archetype is now in some sense paler than its copy [Albion]” (182).
 
A brief conclusion reflects further on at least two aspects of  Blake’s conception of the gift that frustrate any tidy thesis—his  ruptures with friends and patrons and his erasure of passages from the  third plate of Jerusalem that imply a close relationship with the reader.
 
	In a book that offers such subtle analyses of the complex systems of  social and economic transaction surrounding Blake’s concept of the  gift, it would have been helpful to see clear transitional bridges  between chapters and a consistent evolution of the argument. It requires  a good deal of patience to identify the trajectory of the thesis and  follow its permutations. Too often the chapters read like discrete  essays that plunge us into thickets of dense theoretical matter without a  machete or the author’s megaphone. So much of the material here is  quoted, so many ideas overlap, that often one has a hard time discerning  the source of an insight (is it Mann or Mauss?). In place of a direct  payoff from the amassing of evidence stand lengthy cited passages. It’s  true that Haggarty eventually qualifies or modifies most views expressed  by cultural or literary theorists, but the reader has to work very hard  to unearth these interventions. One casualty of the book’s format is  Blake himself, who often bows to Bourdieu or Derrida and whose poetic  texts emerge tentatively at the ends of chapters. The brief close  readings of passages and plates are valuable, but they leave us  hankering for more commentary, especially on the designs. In the end  perhaps only the veteran Blake scholar will find wisdom along this  book’s perilous path. The rest of us, like Rintrah, shall roar and shake  our fires in the burdened air.

The Mathews as Patrons
 
By G. E. Bentley, Jr.
 
G. E. Bentley, Jr. (gbentley@chass.utoronto.ca) has been publishing about William Blake and his circle since 1954.
 
 
 
Harriet Mathew and her husband,With thanks to Angus Whitehead for many favors. the Reverend Anthony Stephen Mathew, are well known as patrons of William Blake and John Flaxman.A Stepn.  Mathew and Harriot Edwards were married at St. Martin-in-the-Fields on  31 January 1764, according to the St. Martin’s registers.For details about the Mathews, see J. T. Smith, Nollekens and His Times (1828) (in G. E. Bentley, Jr., Blake Records, 2nd ed. [New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004] [hereafter BR(2)] 604-06); H. M. Margoliouth, “Blake’s Mr. Mathew,” Notes and Queries 196 (1951): 162-63; G. E. Bentley, Jr., “A. S. Mathew, Patron of Blake and Flaxman,” Notes and Queries 203 (1958): 168-78, and “John Flaxman and the Mathew Clan,” Bulletin of the New York Public Library 67 (1963): 443-54. Their portraits by Flaxman are in BR(2), pls. 4-5. As J. T. Smith wrote, about 1784 the house of “Mrs. Mathew, … No. 27, in Rathbone-place, was then frequented by most of the literary and talented people of the day,”See BR(2) 605. and Flaxman’s sister-in-law Maria Denman wrote that A. S. Mathew’s wife “was the intimate associate of Mrs. Montague, Mrs. Barbauld, Mrs. Chapone, Mrs. Brooke, andc.”John Flaxman, Lectures on Sculpture (London, 1829), “A Brief Memoir of the Author,” xiii; the rough draft of the work (British Library Add MS 39785, p. 4ff), apparently in the hand of Maria Denman, omits Mrs. Chapone, suggesting that the names were added more or less at random. Allan Cunningham quotes this passage in his life of Flaxman but does not identify the source. However, a search over fifty years revealed no clear reference to A. S. Mathew or to his wife in the records of Anna Letitia Barbauld, James Boswell, Fanny Burney, Mrs. Chapone, Benjamin Robert Haydon, Angelica Kauffman, Mrs. Montagu, George Romney, Hester Thrale, or Horace Walpole, many of them notorious gossips.
  
At Mrs. Mathew’s 

most agreeable conversaziones … I [J. T. Smith] have often heard him [Blake] read and sing several of his poems. He was listened to by the company with profound silence, and allowed by most of the visitors to possess original and extraordinary merit. 
Mrs. Mathew was not only a great encourager of musical composers, … but truly kind to young artists.J. T. Smith, A Book for a Rainy Day (1845) 81-83, reprinted in BR(2) 29-30.

 
One of the singers at these “conversaziones” was almost certainly  Harriet, the talented seventeen-year-old daughter of A. S. and Harriet  Mathew. Her early decease was commemorated in the Gentleman’s Magazine:Gentleman’s Magazine 84 (1798, Supplement): 1152 (under “Deaths”): 1798. March 28. At the houſe of her father (the Rev. Mr. Mathew) in Rathbone-place, in her 32d year, of a pulmonic complaint, Harriet Baroneſs Silverhelm, wife of Baron S. a young lady of the moſt uncommon and brilliant talents and accompliſhments, amongſt which muſt ever be remembered with peculiar enthuſiaſm her vocal performances, unequalled, for ſcience and expreſſion, except by the firſt Italian profeſſors, when muſick was in its glory. Her elegant and various acquirements were rendered doubly attractive by the unaffected modeſty and innumerable graces of her manners, the exquiſite refinement and ſenſibility of her mind, the univerſal benevolence of her heart, and the active virtues of a life devoted, in an exemplary manner, to every ſocial, relative, and pious duty.   According to Joseph Farington’s diary for 6 August 1798, “Miss Mathew daughr. of Revd. Mr. Mathew, was it seems privately married abt. a year before Her death to Baron Silverghem, who was Secretary to Baron Noleken, and to Mr. Asp.”The Diary of Joseph Farington, ed. Kenneth Garlick and Angus Macintyre, vol. 3 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1979) 1044. A reference of 7 Aug. 1805 identifies her as the daughter of Mr. “Matthews” (vol. 7, ed. Kathryn Cave [1982] 2602). This is Göran Ulrik Silfverhjelm of the Swedish embassy in London. Harriet would have been about sixteen and nineteen when, as “Miss Mathew,” she subscribed to Letters of the Late Ignatius Sancho (1782) and Elizabeth Blower, Maria (1785).
 
We have no evidence beyond J. T. Smith’s about Mrs. Mathew’s patronage of the arts and her sponsorship of Blake’s Poetical Sketches (1783). Her familiarity with the fashionable world has not been confirmed in letters and diaries among the beau monde, and her only known patronage of literature has been her remarkable fostering of Poetical Sketches.Neither she nor her husband is known to have owned any literary or artistic work by Blake. But she was a patroness of literature, at least in the modest form of subscribing to books. She appears in the subscription lists of

Going back more than thirty years, Dennis Read has published articles large and small about the activities of Blake’s associate Robert Hartley Cromek (1770–1812); in the most important of these, “The Rival Canterbury Pilgrims of Blake and Cromek: Herculean Figures in the Carpet” (Modern Philology, 1988), he showed that contrary to the account assembled by  Gilchrist and echoed by most of Blake’s subsequent biographers, who hold that Cromek stole the idea from Blake, Blake’s Chaucer picture and engraving were conceived and created in response to the painting by Thomas Stothard and the projected engraving after it. Now Read has gathered together much of what else he has found out about Cromek in a more comprehensive biography that concentrates on the busy final decade of Cromek’s life, arguing persuasively that Cromek has been (somewhat) misunderstood.
 
Born in Yorkshire, Cromek studied at first to be a lawyer, and then at eighteen came to London to learn engraving from the Italian-born painter/engraver Francesco Bartolozzi. A twelve-page chapter covers Cromek’s professional career from 1788 to the beginnings of the Grave project in 1805; it focuses mostly on wheeling and dealing rather than Cromek’s practice as an engraver, identifying major engraving projects and outlining early disputes with publishers and collaborators. It ends with a report from one of Cromek’s friends that although Cromek was “nominally an Engraver; … his tastes and sympathies lay in another direction.” The artistic and artisanal aspects of Cromek’s early career are treated as incidental: “Engraving,” writes Read, “… served Cromek mainly as a way of introducing him to the art world and, more importantly, to the prominent figures who moved in it” (18).
 
Cromek certainly did lose interest in actual burin work after about 1805, and Read shows that he often farmed out portions of his projects to others, but by the time he retreated from practice as an engraver he had spent almost half his life working in the trade, much of it in the more artistically ambitious end of the illustration business, even if he was not a creator of original designs. This chapter would be stronger if it included a survey and some more examples of Cromek’s chalcographic output so that we could see his strengths and weaknesses, judge the trajectory of his career, or consider other ways that his engraving could shed light on his later projects, and on Blake’s. For instance, did Cromek try harder than Blake did to conform to publishing fashions? How do Cromek’s book engravings after Stothard in the 1790s compare to those that Blake did in the early 1780s? How about the illustrations to Shakespeare after Fuseli that both Cromek and Blake did for Chalmers (not “Chambers”) around 1803? Does Cromek’s work as an engraver of Stothard shed any light on the relationship between publisher, engraver(s), and artist in the case of Stothard’s Chaucer picture? Shelley M. Bennett’s Thomas Stothard: The Mechanisms of Art Patronage in England circa 1800 (1988) includes very handy (but not complete) lists by date of Stothard’s works and engravings after him—a similar appendix of Cromek’s engravings might assist scholars to assess Cromek’s career for themselves. But the information in this chapter that is most relevant to comprehending Cromek’s later dealings with Blake is the ample evidence that long before he and Blake fell out, Cromek often dealt with his business associates with sharp elbows.
 
The less perfunctory chapter on the history of Cromek’s illustrated edition of Robert Blair’s The Grave shows Cromek in a more positive light than Blake’s party has usually been willing to grant him. Read carefully follows the contemporary records of Cromek’s transactions and representations as the project evolved, showing that although plans changed in ways that worked out to Blake’s disadvantage, Cromek’s primary motivation appears to have been to ensure that his artistically and commercially ambitious project was a success. Cromek’s elbows were as sharp as ever, and there is plenty of ungallant trimming in his business arrangements and shameless puffing in his promotions, but Read convincingly demonstrates that Cromek was never the villain that Gilchrist and most of his successors have made him out to be. Once again, Read’s focus as a biographer is on elucidating the tactical calculations behind Cromek’s commercial and promotional efforts rather than exploring the artistic thoughts of the various parties to the project. Although the book reflects the recent rediscovery of Blake’s lost designs for Blair (and an appendix details the steps in that rediscovery), very little is made of them or their implications for improved understanding of Cromek or Blake or the published edition of The Grave. Because Cromek’s most important design contribution to the Blair project may have been to select the images that were actually engraved and published, the renewed availability of many of the rejected designs could have afforded insights into his thinking as an editor and book designer.
 
The collision between Blake and Cromek over the Blair project reflects a fundamental difference in the way the two men approached the making of art and the making of money; the succeeding episode in their relationship, the creation of competing Chaucer paintings and engravings, appears to have been the result of mutual recognition of that difference, and here, Read argues, it is Blake’s biographers who have misunderstood what was going on. Read refines and updates the arguments in his 1988 article, showing that contemporary first-party evidence indicates that long before Blake showed any interest in illustrating Chaucer, Cromek and Stothard had undertaken to create and promote a painting of Chaucer’s pilgrims that could be the basis of a profitable large-scale engraving. Like the illustrated edition of The Grave, this was calculated as a middlebrow cultural/commercial project that would be both lucrative and prestigious for artist, engraver, and entrepreneur. Stothard executed his part with his usual technical brilliance and shrewdly sentimental superficiality. His painting was calculated for broad appeal, offering gently satirical stereotypes, sunny English nostalgia, unchallenging literary pretentions—who wouldn’t love such a picturesque parade? Certainly Stothard’s concoction was a cannier offering to the market than the pious sublimity of Blake’s Grave designs, and Blake seems to have decided that the commercial mechanism embodied in the picture and Cromek’s campaign to exploit it constituted a challenge to everything he believed in. When Cromek, mystified by the intensity of Blake’s detestation, challenged him to create his own version of the subject, Blake took him up on it, creating a picture with a vast allegorical program and an exhibition, advertisements, and Descriptive Catalogue to match the promotions of Cromek. Unlike his rivals, Blake delivered his engraving roughly as scheduled, but was humiliated in the aftermath. Even though both Cromek and his chosen engraver, Schiavonetti, died before their project could be completed, the Stothard Chaucer eventually achieved much of the success that Cromek dreamed for it, becoming Stothard’s most famous work.
 
Another project of Cromek’s that impinges on Blake’s biography, though indirectly, was the Chalcographic Society, later the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts of Engraving. What sounds like a benign professional organization was actually another, even more ambitious, version of the entrepreneurial approach to art marketing that drove the Blair and Chaucer projects: Cromek, operating as the “Secretary to the Chalcographic Society,” attempted to bring together the foremost patrons of the day with the heavyweights of painting and engraving to promote subscriptions for a series of twenty huge engravings from new British paintings—the patrons would confer social prestige, the painters would offer cultural prestige, and the engravers would enable mass production of freshly minted elite works of art, generating vast profits that could be tapped to benefit engravers and engraving, as well as others.
 
The engraver John Landseer (father of Edwin) responded to the Chalcographic Society’s promotions by publishing an extravagantly critical Letter to a Member of the Society for Encouraging the Art of Engraving (July 1810), followed by A Second and a Third Letter … (apparently published together but dated August and October 1810). These letters take on the scheme from a variety of angles—economic, political, ethical, practical, logical, aesthetic; the second two (with addenda) counterattack the insulting response to the first by Robert Hunt, Blake’s nemesis. It is too bad that Read was unable to locate these serially paginated pamphlets (which are bound together in the Rosenwald Collection, now available digitally as a “page turner” at http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/rosenwald.04580), and  had to reconstruct Landseer’s elegantly devastating critiques from the attempts to refute them by Hunt and Cromek. Blake also responded to the controversy, probably about the same time, by drafting his famous  unpublished “Public Address,” in which he excoriates the Chalcographic Society’s efforts in terms much less diplomatic than Landseer’s; it seems likely  to me that Blake and Landseer were aware of each other’s feelings at some  point, but I have yet to see evidence of influence in either direction. By 1811  Cromek’s most ambitious attempt to harness Mammon by means of the arts had  collapsed, partly due to Landseer’s criticisms, but also because of  problems with its huge scale and other causes, including Cromek’s  failing health. The subscribers were repaid, and Mammon, of course, moved on, unperturbed.
 
The remainder of the book, outlining Cromek’s projects related to Robert Burns, will be of less interest to Blake scholars, though there is further evidence of Cromek’s ethical shortcomings, his resourcefulness as a promoter, and his energy in the last years despite tuberculosis; an appendix on travel by coach makes clear the hardships involved in his innovations in marketing the arts to the provinces.
 
This is a valuable book, and the new information in it is likely to  lead eventually to revision of key points of Blake’s biography. But it is also a bit  slapdash, as if an old manuscript was hastily updated to reflect recent  discoveries. There are dismaying clusters of petty errors. In the first few  paragraphs of the second chapter, for instance, Robert is referred to as Thomas (his  father’s name), the family is traced to “Kidwick,” rather than (presumably)  Kildwick in Yorkshire, and the Cromeks are said to move south rather  than west from Hull to Manchester. Most of the page citations from Erdman’s Poetry and Prose are from the first edition rather than the now standard 1982 edition listed in the bibliography, and are thus wrong by several pages. It is not likely that there will be another biography of Cromek, so these minor shortcomings are regrettable, but this book brings us substantially closer to understanding Blake’s contrary counterpart and the world they shared.

Blake’s Hebrew Calligraphy
 
By Abraham Samuel Shiff
 
Abraham Samuel Shiff (abe.sam.shiff@gmail.com) studies in the Master of Arts in Liberal Studies Program, the Graduate Center, City University of New York. Another paper, Blake’s Priestly Blessing: God Blesses Job, is forthcoming in Blake. He has also published on Shakespeare.
 
 
 
The exhibition at the Morgan Library and Museum of William Blake’s World: “A New Heaven Is Begun” (Sept. 2009–Jan. 2010) provided an opportunity to examine closely Blake’s Hebrew calligraphy.I am indebted to Anna Lou Ashby, Andrew W. Mellon Curator of the Morgan Library and Museum, for her encouragement and advice, and for being my authority for facts and information pertaining to Blake. Three works in the exhibition (see illus. 2.1, 3.1, and 3.6)This paper examines the three works for Blake’s use of Hebrew characters as calligraphy. Additional works (from the Morgan and elsewhere) are described when helpful for the analysis. The paper is not a survey of all of Blake’s use of Hebrew. For the  literature examining his use of Hebrew (mystical or otherwise), see  Spector, “Blake as an Eighteenth-Century Hebraist” and “Blake’s Graphic Use of  Hebrew,” Cheskin, Paice, and their bibliographies. contain errors in forming Hebrew characters; some are deliberate to create clever visual illusions.
 
For clarity, several conventions are adopted for this article: 1. Images: Items from the Morgan are cited by accession number, and if exhibited also by exhibition number. The exhibited images are viewable on the museum’s web site http://www.themorgan.org/collections/works/blake.Click on “Begin exhibition.” The images are numbered from 1 through 92. They are in color and may be manipulated for magnification. 2. Hebrew alphabet: For the convenience of readers without any knowledge of Hebrew, a numeric code is used (see table 1). For example, English is read from left to right. The first four characters of the English alphabet are A B C D. In contrast, Hebrew is read from right to left. The first four characters of the Hebrew alphabet are  א   ב   ג   ד‎. The encoded Hebrew becomes 04-03-02-01. Some letters of the Hebrew alphabet change shape when located at the end of a word. The code “f” identifies a final character. For example, the four-letter English word “amen” is the three-letter Hebrew word “אמן‎” that encodes as        א   מ   ן‎        14f-13-01, where        14f indicates that the last letter of the word is character “נ‎” (14) written in its final form, which is “ן‎” (14f).

1. Night Thoughts
  
When Blake illustrated Edward Young’s Night Thoughts (1797), he included an image of God holding a scroll with Hebrew characters (illus. 1.1).

Pierpont Morgan Library, New York. Gift of Mrs. Landon K. Thorne, 1973. Note the emanating radiance and pensive expression. Compare to the depiction of God in illus. 3.6.
 
 By enlarging and rotating the scroll I have made it possible to interpret the characters more easily (illus. 1.2). 
 
1.2. Night Thoughts p. 63, with the scroll enlarged and rotated. The ambiguous letters are flagged “?” and those that are obviously reversed are marked “R”.
 
 These apparent words align with the right margin, as they should. They do not appear to form legible words, however, but to be scrambled for visual effect. Most surprising is that the letters are in reverse—wrongly engraved. Even though letters “א”‎ (01) are reversed, they are drawn in classical Hebrew-style serif. In later drawings and engravings, Blake adopts an “N” shape for letter “א”‎ (01). Serif Hebrew letters are composed of segments drawn broad and narrow, as seen in table 1. Here Blake made the broad elements, which are usually solid, in outline, as if hollow. In doing so, he may be mimicking a popular Hebrew lexicon that used “hollow” letters as a teaching guide (illus. 1.3).John Parkhurst designed his Hebrew and English lexicon to teach Hebrew, as the title explains: … Adapted to the Use of Learners, and of Those [self-taught students] Who Have Not the Benefit of a Master. Illus. 1.3 is from the 1762 edition; later editions were published in 1778, 1792, and 1799, and all four are viewable in Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO). Each edition has a section on Hebrew grammar containing hollow letters. In a footnote, Parkhurst instructs the student: “If the Reader will take the trouble to colour the hollow letters with red ink, in this and the following examples, he will make the Examples still more clear and distinct; and indeed this may be no unprofitable exercise to a Beginner” (1762, ECCO image 17; 1778, 45; 1792, 22; 1799, 24). For examples of hollow letters, examine the grammar section pages following the instruction. The last three editions also contain a chart with a title implying it is a writing guide (1778, ECCO image 38; 1792, 15; 1799, 17), but which actually portrays fragmented and distorted letters, as if to be a guide to reading print made by battered type. Blake may have used the fragments as models for some of his graffiti-like Hebrew characters, though it is only speculation that he saw and emulated Parkhurst’s lexicon. Illus. 1.3 is an enlarged portion of a verb conjugation table (1762, ECCO image 19). Copies of Parkhurst may be seen in Google Books.

 Although scholars search for meaning in the “words,” what Blake engraved appears to be graffiti-like emulation of Hebrew.Spector describes the “words” as “pseudo-hebraic” (“Blake’s Graphic Use of Hebrew” 67). For attempts to decipher their meaning, see Young, Night Thoughts (Folio Society), commentary vol., 71-72. 
Hebrew words are in a preparatory drawing for a plate never engraved (illus. 1.4).For reproduction of the complete set of watercolors, see the Folio Society edition; see also the British Museum web site http://www.britishmuseum.​org.

 Clearly visible is the penciled outline for the left “א”‎ (01). Beyond any doubt, Blake uses the classical serif style, but this is not proof that he had command of the Hebrew language. Of the competence perceivable in the composition, H. M. Margoliouth notes, “[Blake] seems to have been provided with some Hebrew, perhaps not very legible, of which he made a muddle” (emphasis mine).“A Hebraist tells me … there are two Hebrew words, meaning ‘hereafter pain’ and referring to ‘Awful Eternity! offended Queen!’, which are fairly correct. … Here he [Blake] seems to have been provided with some Hebrew, perhaps not very legible, of which he made a muddle” (Margoliouth 49). 
Hebrew words written without the diacritical symbols that indicate vowels can be ambiguous and challenging to translate.I thank Ari Cohen for his insightful assistance with this translation. Fortunately, the context is known. On the left side of the block of text, between the first and second lines, Blake penciled an “X” (visible in illus. 1.4) identifying the words that he chose to illustrate:See Young, Night Thoughts (Folio Society), commentary vol., xviii. 

TIME was! ETERNITY now reigns alone! Awful Eternity! offended Queen!
 The offended queen is the crowned woman. She points upwards towards eternity while holding a book with Hebrew words—a metaphor for GodFor Blake, God is eternal and awe inspiring. He associates Hebrew with God (see illus. 1.1, 3.1, 3.6, and 3.7).—and standing triumphantly on the face and throat of two vanquished figures—a metaphor for time.Blake often depicts death in Night Thoughts by two different figures. One has a shaven head, sometimes with just a topknot, as drawn here. The other is an aged man with flowing hair and beard. In this composition, he uses both to represent time that brings death to all living beings. Blake uses well-known representations for death and time: see Quarles, “Book 3. Emblemes,” 181, and “Hierogliph VI,” 23. Mindful of the context, we may now attempt a translation. 
At first glance, there are two words, one on each page of the open book. Actually, this is a phrase of three words spread over the two pages.Blake uses the same composition in placing a Hebrew slogan in a Job drawing (see the analysis of illus. 3.1, below). We begin with the right page, as Hebrew is read from right to left. Parse the letters into two words, each of three letters. The rightmost word, “ריב”‎ (__02-10-20__), means “strife.” Next is “אחר”‎ (__20-08-01__), which translates to “after.” The left page contains one word. Finding a meaningful translation consistent with the theme requires three manipulations to correct errors typical of a neophyte Hebraist. As written, “כאם”‎ (__13f-01-11__) translates to “as a mother.” Clearly, this is contextually inappropriate. (1) Replace the “א”‎ (01) with “ע”‎ (16), as both have the English sound of A.The two consonants, “א”‎ (01) and “ע”‎ (16), have the same pronunciation in the Ashkenazi and Sephardi dialects. Neophytes to Hebrew often use one for the other. (Interestingly, the dialect spoken by Jews from Yemen maintains a tradition of different pronunciations for the two consonants.) (2) Replace the “ם”‎ (13f), which has the English sound of M, with the near identically shaped “ס”‎ (15), which has the English sound of S. The word becomes “כעס”‎ (__15-16-11__), meaning “anger.”The Hebraist quoted by Margoliouth (see note above) stopped at this point. This is still not contextually acceptable. Another correction is possible. (3) Replace the “ס”‎ (15) with the same-sounding “ת”‎ (22).In both the Sephardi and Ashkenazi dialects “ס”‎ (15) has the S sound. Not so with “ת”‎ (22) (see next note). In the Ashkenazi dialect spoken by Jews in Blake’s London who originated from Germanic and East European regions, the “ת”‎ (22) is pronounced S as in “sav” (and not T as in “tav,” as indicated in table 1).In the Sephardi dialect, today prevalent in Israel, “ת”‎  (22) is pronounced as T, as in “tav,” with or without the diacritical mark  dagesh, especially when a word ends with this letter. (The dagesh symbol is a dot placed in  the center of a letter: Microsoft Word, symbol chart, Times New Roman font,  Unicode hexadecimal representation 05BC.) In the Ashkenazi dialect  spoken in Germanic lands and central Europe—and today by those trained in this tradition, as was the  author—the rule for pronouncing the diacritical mark is observed, thus “ת”‎ as S, as in “sav,” and “תּ”‎ as T, as in “tav.” For example, the word “Sabbath” is written “שבת”‎ (__22-02-21__), pronounced by the Sephardi speaker as shah-baht and by the Ashkenazi as shah-bahs. Table 1 conforms to the Microsoft Office Word  symbol chart’s convention for assigning English names to Hebrew  characters. The Times New Roman font, Unicode hexadecimal representation  05EA is assigned to “ת”‎ and is labeled “Hebrew letter tav.” FB4A is assigned to “תּ”‎ and is labeled “Hebrew letter tav with dagesh.” It is obvious that whoever  assigned the English labels for the “sav” and “tav” used the Sephardi  dialect. For a linguist’s explanation, see Bar-Adon, chapter 6, “On Some Basic Differences between the Ashkenazi and the Sephardi Traditions of Pronunciation,” 27-30. To conceptualize this third and necessary correction, the Ashkenazi pronunciation is critical. Make this change, and the word becomes “כעת”‎ (__22-16-11__), meaning “as time.” Together, the Hebrew phrase may be translated:The impression given by the phrase is that it is a simplistic translation of the English “Time, as after the strife,” literally replacing each English word with a Hebrew equivalent, one by one, working from left to right as English is written and read, instead of creating a Hebrew translation from the sense of the English. 

ריב   אחר   כעת‎ As time, after strife
 The image portrays the offended queen pointing to eternity triumphant over vanquished time, after strife has concluded. 
Blake had another opportunity to include Hebrew characters in Night Thoughts (illus. 1.5). That image illustrates an incident described in Daniel chapter 5, where strange words appear on a wall to announce the impending doom of the startled and alarmed King Belshazzar. The complete slogan is MENE, MENE, TEKEL UPHARSIN (Daniel 5.25). In the engraving, however, Blake uses a few faintly drawn English characters to represent the slogan, instead of Hebrew letters.

One may infer that Blake was not in command of the Hebrew alphabet in 1797, because in Night Thoughts he uses Hebrew-like graffiti mixed with actual letters (although reversed) and Hebrew words with apparent errors. In 1803 he writes to his brother, declaring that he was then first learning Hebrew—“am now learning my Hebrew”—and demonstrating the first three letters of the alphabet: “אבג”‎ (__03-02-01__) (illus. 1.6).

 He also writes, “I go on Merrily with my Greek and Latin … I read Greek as fluently as an Oxford scholar and the Testament is my chief master ….” It is tempting to speculate that Blake in later works forms the Hebrew “א”‎ (01) as the Greek letter “nu” (N) because he studied Greek and read the Septuagint. The use of the N-shape must be deliberate, because we have here evidence of his ability to form the “א”‎ (01) in its classical shape from the letter of 1803 and in the earlier Night Thoughts engraving and drawing. 
To support an argument advanced later, I here make note of the variety of errors in publishing the Hebrew characters that Blake wrote to his brother (see illus. 1.6); some of these errors have been brought to the attention of Blake scholars by Arnold Cheskin.See Cheskin 178, 180.

Commentary
 
0. See illus. 1.6. Blake ends his English sentence with a period, followed by the three Hebrew letters for ABC, “אבג‎” (__03-02-01__), all properly formed and without punctuation.
 
1. Geoffrey Keynes, A Bibliography of William Blake (New York: Grolier Club, 1921), “Appendix III: Letters Hitherto Uncollected, Letter 23,” 451. The leftmost letter is wrong.
 
2. Geoffrey Keynes, ed., The Writings of William Blake, 3 vols. (London: Nonesuch Press, 1925) 2: 242. Fales Library and Special Collections, New York University. Instead of the ABC that Blake wrote, the Nonesuch edition inexplicably uses the four-letter Hebrew word for “Job” (see illus. 3.5).
 
3. Mona Wilson, The Life of William Blake (London: Nonesuch Press, 1927) 142. Wilson apparently copied the 1925 Keynes (Nonesuch). Could this be an error by the same Nonesuch editor?
 
4. Mona Wilson, The Life of William Blake (London: Peter Davies, 1932) 144. The typesetting of the 1932 edition is an egregiously erroneous reproduction of the 1927 Wilson (Nonesuch).
 
5. Mona Wilson, The Life of William Blake (London: Hart-Davis, 1948) 149. The error of using Job’s name is perpetuated in this edition with an attempt to reproduce the 1927 Wilson (Nonesuch). However, the error is compounded because the leftmost letter is wrong for Job’s name.
 
6. Geoffrey Keynes, ed., The Letters of William Blake (London: Hart-Davis, 1956) 83. Hart-Davis corrects the leftmost-character error of the 1921 Keynes (Grolier) edition, but inexplicably adds a superscript symbol that is in the shape of a diamond, indicated by the red arrow. Blake has no character or symbol to the right of his rightmost letter. In Hebrew, the traditional full stop (period) may be a single diamond subscript, or two diamonds one above the other (as in a colon). Since Hebrew is read from right to left, the full stop would properly be placed to the left of the leftmost letter. Did the typesetter intend the letter “י”‎ (10) and use a diamond instead?
 
7. Geoffrey Keynes, ed., The Complete Writings of William Blake: With All the Variant Readings (London: Nonesuch Press, 1957) 821. Poorly printed, as if done with battered type. The letter left of center could be either “ב”‎ (02) or “כ”‎ (11). The rightmost is not a superscript diamond—possibly just battered type “י”‎ (10). 

8. David V. Erdman, ed., The Poetry and Prose of William Blake, commentary by Harold Bloom (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1965) 696. Erdman adds a fourth, superfluous character on the extreme right. 
 
9. Geoffrey Keynes, ed., The Complete Writings of William Blake: With Variant Readings (London: Oxford University Press, 1966) 821. The three letters are printed with battered type, making the center ambiguous, either “ב”‎ (02) or “כ”‎ (11). 
 
10. Geoffrey Keynes, ed., The Letters of William Blake, 2nd ed. (London: Hart-Davis, 1968) 65. The three letters are correct. 
 
11. Mona Wilson, The Life of William Blake (New York: Cooper Square Publishers, 1969) 53. The same error as in the 1927 Wilson (Nonesuch). 
 
12. Mona Wilson, The Life of William Blake (London: Oxford University Press, 1971) 169. This edition of Wilson has been modified to attempt what Blake actually wrote, except that the leftmost character is wrong.
 
13. G. E. Bentley, Jr., ed., William Blake’s Writings, 2 vols. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978) 2: 1570. The three letters are correct.  Further note is made that in 1: 666, where the Laocoön is  described, Bentley’s representation of Blake’s Hebrew for “Jesus” is  wrong. Blake engraved two letters in reverse, but the letters are  correct (see illus. 3.7b). Bentley has it as  “ישצ‎” (__18-21-10__). The typesetter mistakenly used “צ‎” (18) instead of the “ע‎” (16) that Blake engraved backwards, and the error was not recognized. See also illus. 3.2a3. 
 
14. Mary Lynn Johnson and John E. Grant, eds., Blake’s Poetry and Designs: Authoritative Texts, Illuminations in Color and Monochrome, Related Prose, Criticism (New York: W. W. Norton, 1979) 465. The center letter is poorly printed, as if with battered type, and could be either “ב”‎ (02) or “כ”‎ (11). 

15. Geoffrey Keynes, ed., The Letters of William Blake: With Related Documents, 3rd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980) 53. The center letter is incorrect.
 
16. David V. Erdman, ed., The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake,  commentary by Harold Bloom, newly rev. ed. (Berkeley: University of  California Press, 1982) 727. A double error is introduced. The center  letter is wrong, and it is printed with a diacritical symbol—the dot in  the center of the letter, the dagesh—which Blake did not use.
 
17. David V. Erdman, ed., The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, commentary by Harold Bloom, newly rev. ed. (New York: Anchor Books, 1988) 727. The center letter is incorrect.
 
 
 
2. Christ Nailed to the Cross: The Third Hour
 
We next consider a drawing from the Passion cycle: Christ Nailed to the Cross: The Third Hour (illus. 2.1). Behind the head of Christ is a person with Hebrew on his costume in two places: over the forehead on the miter, and on the hem of the robe draped over the left forearm.  

 
2.1. Christ Nailed to the Cross: The Third Hour. Exhibition image 66. Accession number EVT 9. Thaw Collection, Pierpont Morgan Library.
 
 The headpiece identifies the person as the high priest, whose official vestments included a miter with a gold plate. As described in Exodus 28.36, engraved on the plate were the words 

  The right word means “holy” (consecrated), and the left contains the tetragrammatonTetragrammaton is defined in table 3, note a. and translates as “to the Lord.”See the monograph on priestly vestments by Haran in the Encyclopaedia Judaica. Blake drew something different: five distinct letters are flanked by two ambiguous characters (illus. 2.2).  
 
2.2. Christ Nailed to the Cross: The Third Hour. The high priest’s miter.
 
 Blake’s letters are 

  which may be parsed as 

  Perhaps he intended to write “נ”‎ (14) instead of what appears clearly to be “ג”‎ (03).The justification for this assumption is the obvious error in illus. 3.2e, where “ג”‎ (03) is used in place of a textually required “נ”‎ (14). See also how Blake forms the “ג”‎ (03) in the letter to his brother (illus. 1.6). Also, if the ambiguous letters on either side are “י”‎ (10), the phrase will read 

  The right word is the tetragrammaton and the left translates as “I,” for the two-word phrase “I am the Lord.”I am indebted to Ari Cohen for this suggestion. Literally interpreted, this would have the high priest proclaim himself to be God—certainly not a Jewish theological concept, but blasphemy, as Blake would have known.Did Blake use this opportunity to slur the high priest? Spector explains: “Although difficult for someone of the twentieth century to comprehend, the most significant aspect of eighteenth-century Christian Hebraism was its anti-Semitism” (“Blake as an Eighteenth-Century Hebraist” 180). See also Alexander Gilchrist, Life of William Blake, “Pictor Ignotus” : “Though at one with Paine, Godwin, Fuseli, and the others [of his circle], as to politics, he was a rebel to their theological or anti-theological tenets. Himself a heretic among the orthodox, here among the infidels he was a saint, and staunchly defended Christianity—the spirit of it—against these strangely assorted disputants” (1: 94). Gilchrist does not report details of the theological debates. Any discussion about Christianity would necessarily draw upon its Judaic roots. Alternatively, perhaps Blake wrote “ל”‎ (12) instead of “י”‎ (10) as the right ambiguous letterSee the comment on illus. 3.2a on the manner in which Blake forms the letter “ל”‎ (12). Note that the line that Blake drew is as dense as the adjacent letter, and may not be what appears at first glance as the edge of the plate. in an attempt to have the right word represent (as a contraction) “to the Lord.” Literally translated, the phrase becomes the awkward “I am to the Lord.”A third suggestion is that the apparent “ג”‎ (03) is actually a poorly executed “ב”‎ (02), making the left word “אבי”‎ (__10-02-01__), which means “my father.” The slogan would then read “The Lord my father.” However, Blake’s obvious error demonstrated in illus. 3.2e makes this possibility unlikely. I am indebted to Carin and Ben Dachs for this suggestion. 
If we set aside consideration of any theological purpose that Blake had in mind in writing this slogan, it appears to represent the same theme as in Job’s Evil Dreams (illus. 3.1). There, Satan points to the slogan “Your God gave from heaven,” which is Blake’s way of depicting God’s authority and permission to test Job, with Satan as his agent. Blake may here be assigning to the high priest the role of a satanic-like agent of God in the crucifixion. Whatever the purpose, Blake uses the high priest’s vestments as a slogan board, just as he makes use of the tablets of the Ten Commandments in the Job drawing. 

I now consider the second slogan. The high priest wears a robe with a string of characters on the hem draped over his left forearm (illus. 2.3). The monograph in the Encyclopaedia Judaica (see note above) describes and illustrates the priestly vestments, as specified in the Bible: there is no robe, nor are there embroidered characters. For Blake, the hem appears to be yet another convenient call-out or balloon space to place one more slogan, although this slogan is not obvious. The words at the start and end are incomplete, as if lost in the folds of the robe, and some characters are ambiguous. One word is distinct, however: “צור”‎ (__20-06-18__), which translates to “rock.” 

 
2.3. Christ Nailed to the Cross: The Third Hour. The high priest’s robe, with the hem enlarged and rotated.
 
 This suggests that Blake was depicting a common phrase, recognizable from just the segment visible. If the phrase was from the Old Testament, a Hebrew Bible concordance should identify it. A concordance search yielded thirty-eight entries for the word “צור”‎ (__20-06-18__) and fourteen for “צורי”‎ (__10-20-06-18__), “my rock.”Wachsman 1602-03. No match was found. The William Blake Archive suggests that the slogan on the hem is an abstract representation of the phylactery worn on the left arm during certain Jewish prayer services.In e-mail correspondence dated 7 March 2010, the Blake Archive graciously provided an advance draft of an editorial note suggesting the phylactery theory: “The Hebrew letters are written vertically, bottom to top, on the priest’s cloak where it falls below his left arm, possibly as an unconventional substitute for the phylactery conventionally worn on the left arm.” The complete note is now published; see the William Blake Archive, Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings, Illustrations to the Bible, object 33, editors’ note on line 02. The wearing of phylacteries is a biblical command (Deuteronomy 6.8) as a devotional reminder during prayer of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. The phylactery contains passages from the Bible: Deuteronomy 6.4-9 and 11.13-21, and Exodus 13.1-16.P. Birnbaum 5n-6n. No sentence there contains the word “צור”‎ (__20-06-18__), which Blake depicts so clearly and centrally. Perhaps he quotes from the New Testament, or from some commentary, or one of his own works, translating the words into Hebrew. 
3. Job Series
 
We next examine Job’s Evil Dreams, one of the twenty-one drawings for the Thomas Butts Job series, which contains eight Hebrew words (illus. 3.1).

 In the upper center background, partly obscured by Satan’s cloven-hoofed leg and the snake coiled around his torso, there is a representation of the Ten Commandments on two conjoined tablets, with Hebrew in sans-serif characters. Blake wrote the letters sans serif in his typical flowing manner. Serif offers certain visual clues to identify one letter from another that are lost in sans serif, thus demanding great caution in forming the letters. Even if we allow for artistic liberties, he formed many incorrectly.Spector argues that “since Blake probably had a Hebrew text before him as he worked [on Job’s Evil Dreams], had he wished, he could have reproduced this source [the Ten Commandments] exactly. The picture’s irregularities, then, are probably deliberate rather than accidental” (“Blake as an Eighteenth-Century Hebraist” 201; emphasis mine). Having thus dismissed consideration that Blake made errors, Spector hypothesizes his rationale for drawing as he did. Of course, he was in the early stages of his Hebrew studies at this time, if indeed he continued to study much beyond the 1803 date of the letter to his brother (illus. 1.6). 
The crucial contextual guide to recognizing the letters that Blake  wrote is the words of the Ten Commandments as given in Exodus 20.2-14.  Although the commandments vary in wordiness in the biblical text, tradition represents each with  two words. Tradition also places five two-word representations on each of the two  tablets (see table 3).

a. God is known by many names in the Bible. Those who strictly adhere to the third commandment, “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain,” use traditional euphemisms in writing and speaking. “Lord thy God” is an example of an English-language euphemism. The Greek tetragrammaton, literally the four letters, is another, as is the numeric coding scheme used in this paper. When Hebrew is written or spoken, the traditional euphemism is to substitute letters. For the tetragrammaton, the four-letter word “יקוק”‎, which is not a name of God (and codes as __19-06-19-10__), is written or pronounced. The euphemism adopted by this paper to avoid substituting Hebrew letters in writing any of God’s names simply is not to write a word. Each letter stands alone. b. Exodus 20.13 contains four commandments, the sixth through the ninth. The sixth to eighth are sentences of two words, while the ninth is a sentence of five words.
 
 
Illus. 3.2 shows Blake’s tablets enlarged. If we bear in mind that Hebrew is written and read from right to left, the right tablet (to the viewer) should contain five two-word representations of the first through fifth commandments. Blake’s has only one word. The left tablet should begin with the sixth commandment. The sixth is actually the second line. Commandment seven and a portion of the eighth are the third and fourth lines, respectively. 

 
3.2. Job’s Evil Dreams. Enlargement of the tablets.
 
 
My analysis of the calligraphy begins with the left tablet, setting aside the first line, which will be discussed last. Blake depicts on the second line the two-word convention for the sixth commandment, “Thou shalt not kill” (illus. 3.2a):  

 
3.2a. Job’s Evil Dreams. Left tablet, second line.
 
 Note letter “ל”‎ (12). Here and elsewhere, Blake does not carefully form the top horizontal segment. It tends to be a squiggly zigzag shape.Blake’s propensity to form this letter without a horizontal top is important in the analysis of the calligraphy in Christ Nailed to the Cross: The Third Hour  (illus. 2.2). Letter “א”‎ (01) shows two overlaid angle strokes, one correct and the other an error. Examination by microscopeNikon SMZ-U Zoom 1:10. Thaw Conservation Center of the Morgan Library and Museum. shows that the erroneous diagonal was drawn first and then overlaid by the correct stroke (illus. 3.2a1-2). At the instant of drawing the letter, Blake demonstrates ambivalence. The obvious confusion with forming the first letter of the alphabet indicates that at the time of creating the Job series he was not a practiced writer of Hebrew. 
 
3.2a1-2. Job’s Evil Dreams. Magnification of “א”‎ (01) on left tablet, second line.
 
 Analysis of nearly every other letter reinforces this impression. Letter “ת”‎ (22) is distorted. Properly formed, it contains four segments: a top horizontal stroke, an attached vertical stroke descending on the right side, and a vertical stroke descending on the left side with a small additional horizontal stroke at the base turning away from the body of the letter (consider a leg with an attached foot). In sans serif, the foot is the only visual indicator that it is not the similar “ח”‎ (08). Blake drew both vertical strokes with feet attached. Is this artistic embellishment at the expense of legibility or confusion over how to form the letter? Letter “צ”‎ (18) is curious. At first glance, it appears to be the expected צ‎-shape. However, when the image is magnified, Blake’s ambiguity becomes obvious. It appears to be a distorted “ע”‎ (16). The stick figures below (illus. 3.2a3) demonstrate how the letters differ in construction. 
 
“צ”‎ (18)
 
 
 
Blake
 
 
 
“ע”‎ (16)
 
 
Letter “צ”‎ (18) is drawn with a long diagonal descending from the upper left to the lower right to meet with the rightmost end of a horizontal base. A short diagonal from the upper right touches the long diagonal near midpoint. Letter “ע”‎ (16) does not have a horizontal base. The long diagonal descends from the upper right and then angles acutely to the lower left. A shorter diagonal line begins upper left and descends at an angle towards the right until it meets the long diagonal coursing to the left. Compare the stick figures for letters “צ”‎ (18) and “ע”‎ (16) to Blake’s letter in the drawing under magnification.The magnification feature is one of the strengths of the Morgan’s online exhibition. It is not the pattern expected from an experienced hand. 

The third line, of two words, is the seventh commandment: “Thou shalt not commit adultery” (illus. 3.2b). Blake wrote: 

 
3.2b. Job’s Evil Dreams. Left tablet, third line.
 
 The letter “א”‎ (01) is twice used. Careful comparison of the “א”‎s demonstrates that the right instance is reversed, while the left is properly formed. Blake often reverses this letter, which has three elements: an angled stroke that runs from the upper left to the bottom right and two vertical strokes of uneven sizes joined to each side of the angled stroke. Blake uses the “N” shape drawn sans serif. The reversed letter is perfectly recognizable because of the three elements, but the ambiguity in the proper presentation of the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet in this line is glaringly obvious. Letter “נ”‎ (14) is distorted almost to the point of confusion. When properly drawn, the top horizontal segment is shorter than the bottom. With the two horizontal strokes identical, it may be confused with sans-serif letters “ב”‎ (02) and “כ”‎ (11); with the base angled down towards the left, there is room for confusion with “ג”‎ (03). From the context, “נ”‎ (14) is the intended letter. Here, and in examples to follow, Blake shows a propensity to slant what should be a horizontal baseline. 
The eighth commandment, “Thou shalt not steal,” is line four (illus. 3.2c). There Blake wrote a fragment of a word with distorted letters, the end of the second word of the commandment. 

 
3.2c. Job’s Evil Dreams. Left tablet, fourth line.
 
 The complete commandment is 

  From context, the partial character “?” in illus. 3.2c must be “ת”‎ (22), and the “כ”‎ (11) is a distorted “ג”‎ (03) whose lower-right extension is truncated, apparently by artistic design because of the overflowing edge of Satan’s garment. Nevertheless, the apparent “ו”‎ (06) is a distorted “נ”‎ (14), and the last letter, which appears to be “נ”‎ (14), is actually a poorly executed “ב”‎ (02). The ninth and tenth commandments are not depicted. 
Before we consider the first line of the left tablet, it is necessary to analyze the single word on the right tablet, which appears immediately beneath Satan’s outstretched, pointing hand (illus. 3.2d). Blake wrote four letters: 

 
3.2d. Job’s Evil Dreams. Right tablet, line of text.
 
 The first letter (reading from right to left) is certainly “ש”‎ (21), even though when examined under magnification it is hesitatingly drawn, and the center vertical segment, which should angle downwards to the left, is angled towards the right. At first glance, the second letter appears to be “ם”‎ (13f), obviously an error because “ם”‎ is a final letter. From context, it cannot be the very similar “ס”‎ (15). Blake intended “מ”‎ (13). The last letter, “ח”‎ (08), shows a hesitatingly drawn line at its base when magnified, as if Blake was indecisive about the bottom, which, if closed, converts the apparent “ח”‎ (08) to “ם”‎ (13f). The corrections yield 

  which translates into the word “heaven.” There is no such word, however, in the two-word abbreviations of any of the first five commandments. As will be made clear below, Blake has written “heaven” for another purpose.  
For the left tablet’s topmost line (illus. 3.2e), Blake wrote: 

 
3.2e. Job’s Evil Dreams. Left tablet, top line.
 
 To correct his calligraphy, we replace the “ח”‎ (08) with the similar “ה”‎ (05), the poorly shaped “ף”‎ (17f)What I describe as a poorly shaped “ף”‎ (17f) Spector perceives to be a “ך”‎ (11f) with a vowel point (qamats) shaped like a “┬” under the top horizontal stroke (Microsoft Word, Times New Roman font, Unicode hexadecimal representation 05B8). First, and especially in sans serif, it is the small dangling appendage attached to and hanging from the left edge of the top horizontal stroke that differentiates the “ף”‎ (17f) from the “ך”‎ (11f), and it is this appendage that Blake apparently misplaced and mangled. Second, a vowel point must stand apart: no portion should touch any part of the letter. The assumed vowel is attached to the letter, as the magnified drawing clearly shows. Therefore, it is part of the letter and not a vowel point. Third, observe the letter’s vertical stroke bifurcated at its bottom where it should be a single line in both the “ף”‎ (17f) and “ך”‎ (11f). This is just another poorly formed letter. Further, it is usual for multiple letters in a word to be vowelled, when vowels are used at all (although, as Spector points out, there are exceptions). See “Blake’s Graphic Use of Hebrew” 69. with the similar “ך”‎ (11f), the clearly formed “ג”‎ (03) with the very similar “נ”‎ (14), and the last letter of the second word, “ג”‎ (03), with “נ”‎ (14) in its final form, “ן”‎ (14f). The corrected words now read 

  which translates as “Your God gave,” or, alternatively, “Your God gives.”Blake omits vowel symbols. The context permits either version. With artistic license, Blake actually wrote a three-word slogan across the two tablets. Beginning with the lone word on the right tablet, and continuing with the two words at the top of the left tablet, the slogan translates into the almost grammatically correct phrase “Your God gave [gives] from heaven.” Blake precisely depicts the plain text of the Bible—Satan declares his authorization to inflict tribulations on Job by pointing to the tablets of the Ten Commandments, which represent God.He graphically portrays the literal story told in the first two chapters of Job (the authorization is indicated in italics). Satan challenges God: “‘But put forth Thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, surely he will blaspheme Thee to Thy face.’ And the Lord said unto Satan: ‘Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand’” (Job 1.11-12 [Soncino edition]). In the plain text we read of Satan, as God’s “hand,” killing every person belonging to Job, sparing only those who are more useful as tormentors if kept alive, and destroying his wealth (flocks and herds of animals). Job withstands the challenge. Satan returns to God for more authority: “And the Lord said unto Satan: ‘… he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou didst move Me against him, to destroy him without cause.’ And Satan answered the Lord, and said: ‘… But put forth Thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, surely he will blaspheme Thee to Thy face.’ And the Lord said unto Satan: ‘Behold he is in thy hand; only spare his life.’ So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot even unto his crown” (2.3-7). The plain text makes it clear that Satan does nothing of his own volition, without God’s permission and authority. First, God grants Satan permission to test Job, and sets a limit—you may not touch him physically. Thereafter, God extends that authority to permit physical torment, with a new limit—you may not kill him. Satan is the “hand” put forth as God’s authorized agent. Blake graphically portrays the story by showing Satan pointing towards the source of Job’s travail, God, metaphorically represented by the tablets of the Ten Commandments. He then adds imagery not in the Bible—Satan points to his assistants who inflict the tormenting nightmare.In Illustrations of the Book of Job, plate numbered 11 (illus 3.4), Blake describes in a title line what he engraved (emphasis in italics): “Satan himself is transformed into an Angel of Light and his Ministers into Ministers of Righteousness.” As a footnote, Blake quotes Job 7.14: “With Dreams upon my bed thou scarest me and affrightest me with Visions” (the Soncino edition has “Then Thou scarest me with dreams, And terrifiest me through visions”). In this lament, “thou” refers to God, not to Satan. Blake deliberately made the slogan appear to be a commandment—a visual illusion. 
Later, when Blake prepared a set of the Job drawings for John Linnell, he did not attempt to duplicate this ambitious use of Hebrew (illus. 3.3).

 The clever illusion and slogan in the Butts drawing never appeared in print. When the Job set was engraved (illus. 3.4),The plates carry the engraved date 1825, but they were published in 1826. one line of indistinct Hebrew-like graffiti replaced the many lines of Hebrew in the Butts drawing. Now, the tablets alone—without words—serve Blake’s purpose, as Satan points to them to declare the true source of Job’s tribulations and his authority as agent to inflict torments.

In Illustrations of the Book of Job, only two plates have Hebrew, each with two words. The first is the title page (illus. 3.5), in which artistically embellished serif characters reflect the style of the English letters. Although this license causes a distortion to the base of one letter, no ambiguity results because the letter remains distinct and the context is unmistakable. The word on the right translates as “book” and that on the left as “Job,” for “Job’s Book,” or, as Blake properly has it, “The Book of Job.”

 Careful examination of the Hebrew shows that letter “פ”‎ (17) has an erroneous embellishment (illus. 3.5.1). 
 
3.5.1. Illustrations of the Book of Job, title page. Hebrew enlarged.
 
 Extended to the right beyond the vertical stroke, the baseline matches that of letter “ב”‎ (02). This is improper, because the extension is a feature unique to “ב”‎ (02) to differentiate it from the similar “כ”‎ (11), especially in sans serif. This may be artistic license, or not understanding the import of the flourish. It is also possible that Blake mimics a style not used today (see the discussion of illus. 3.6.2j, below). He uses the “N” shape for “א”‎ (01). The title page offers a unique opportunity to appreciate Blake’s artistic embellishments of Hebrew letters by comparison with the English word immediately below (illus. 3.5.2).  
 
3.5.2. Illustrations of the Book of Job, title page. Hebrew and English enlarged.
 
 Note the drooping, angled baseline of the letter “L,” the distortion of the letter “T,” and the embellishments and distortions of “U,” “S,” and “N”: flamboyant artistic license, all. Did Blake express the same license when forming non-serif Hebrew letters, even at the expense of legibility? 
The third plate in the Job series, numbered 2 (illus. 3.6), contains two Hebrew words, one of which by context is apparently misspelled.  

 
3.6. Illustrations of the Book of Job, plate numbered 2. Exhibition image 63. Accession number PML 63939. Pierpont Morgan Library, New York. Gift of Mrs. Landon K. Thorne, 1973.
 
 The words are in the top border, immediately beneath “The Angel of the Divine Presence” (illus. 3.6.1): 
 
3.6.1. Illustrations of the Book of Job, plate numbered 2. Top border enlarged.
 
 The left word is the tetragrammaton, which Blake apparently used to represent the English words “Divine Presence,” although the Hebrew is usually translated as “Lord” (and commonly transliterated as “Jehovah”). The three-letter right word is problematic, because it translates as “king,” not “angel.” The two-word phrase, if considered alone, is not a problem (“Lord the King” or “Jehovah the King”). If Blake intended the Hebrew to represent “The Angel of the Divine Presence,” however, he should have engraved the four-letter word for “angel,” which contains the three letters used for “king”: 

  
Before we consider the riddle that is wrapped in this enigma of Blake’s calligraphy, observe carefully the letter “מ”‎ (13). For whatever reason, Blake here uses a cursive form of the letter. Curiously, he is not consistent, because the letter “ל”‎ (12) remains serif. Compare his letters for “king” (illus. 3.6.2) to the same word from a twentieth-century book whose type is set in cursive (illus. 3.6.2a). 

The double quotation mark figure in the illustration indicates that the letters on either side form a contraction of a common phrase, which the reader is expected to recognize and comprehend from context. It is “גם כן”‎, meaning “also, as well.” The typesetting mimics handwritten cursive, which contains many such contractions to speed writing.

 By using symbols formed by the fewest possible strokes, Hebrew cursive  facilitates speedy handwriting. Letters take on simplified and sometimes radical  changes of shape, as indicated by the red arrows (left to right): 01, 11f, 12,  13, 04, 21, and 02. “Rashi” is the name given to the cursive style shown in  illus. 3.6.2a. Used in writing medieval manuscripts and publishing  biblical and Talmudic incunabula, this typeface continues in use to this day. The  sentence is from a book at hand selected to demonstrate “king.” (Also, compare the cursive Rashi letter “ד”‎ (04) in illus. 3.6.2a with the “T” in “Illustrations” in illus. 3.5.2. Blake apparently mimics Rashi.)Residing in London, he would have had the opportunity to examine Hebrew typography in books printed with Rashi-style letters, if only by browsing the shelves of booksellers. In illus. 3.6.2b, I have written the word “king” in another cursive style in common use, where the letter “מ”‎ (13) takes the shape of a squeezed “N.” Blake’s “מ”‎ (13) matches neither cursive style. 
Specimens of “מ”‎ (13) near contemporary with Blake are in illus. 3.6.2c-j. Examples c-h are handwritten.

 Again, none matches, for two reasons: first, Blake has an embellished flat base extending to the right, and second, he has suppressed the protruding small stroke that should be on the upper-left portion of the letter pointing upwards. He is doing something different. Illus. 3.6.2i-j are from a book published in 1735.

See Orr-Stav 16-17 and Rosenfeld 343 (pl. 560) and 431 (pl. 817).
 
 Exaggerated ornamentation embellishes all letters in this unusual serif-style typeface. It is possible that Blake knew and mimicked this style because his letter “פ”‎ (17) in illus. 3.5.1 has the same extension of the baseline towards the right as the character in illus. 3.6.2j. Nonetheless, Blake’s “מ”‎ (13) significantly differs from illus. 3.6.2i. 
There is yet one more comparison to make. Christian D. Ginsburg (1831–1914) was born in Poland a few years after Blake died and received a traditional Jewish religious education. After emigrating to England as a young man in 1846, he converted to Christianity, entered the circle of the London Christian Hebraists, and eventually became a noted biblical scholar.For a biographical sketch of Ginsburg, see Bloch 583n. Although the word in illus. 3.6.2k was written some five decades after Blake died, it may be compared with Blake’s style because Ginsburg studied Hebrew when a child, making him a virtual contemporary. The five-letter word translates as “in the wilderness.” It was selected because the letter “ב”‎ (02) appears twice, with the right instance adjacent to the letter “מ”‎ (13). Lastly, I place Blake’s and Ginsburg’s “king” side by side in illus. 3.6.2l. 

  
3.6.2k-l. Christian David Ginsburg, Masorah (c. 1880) 57 and 75. YU, MS. 721. The manuscript contains English, Greek, and Hebrew written in Ginsburg’s precise micrographic hand.
 
 Without question, Ginsburg was a skilled Hebraist who knew how to form Hebrew characters. Not so Blake. The impression given by the comparison is that Blake engraved “ב”‎ (02) instead of the intended “מ”‎ (13).Examination of London archives may uncover examples contemporary with Blake of the same version of “ב”‎ (02) as used by Ginsburg. 
The next step of the analysis compares the Job plate (illus. 3.6) with another famous work by Blake, the Laocoön (illus. 3.7), which has the same slogan, “The Angel of the Divine Presence.”

 Blake incorporated Hebrew four times in the Laocoön. A two-letter name for God, in perfectly formed serif letters, is at bottom left (illus. 3.7a). 
 
 In the upper left is the Hebrew for Jesus, with two letters reversed (illus. 3.7b).The name Jesus is spelled with four letters, “ישוע”‎ (__16-06-21-10__), as Spector points out (“Blake’s Graphic Use of Hebrew” 78). The letter “ו”‎ (06) functions as a vowel indicator. With the vowel omitted, the three letters __16-21-10__  mean “to save, to deliver,” as defined in Parkhurst’s lexicon (Parkhurst, 1762, ECCO  image 157). Blake may be using the Hebrew to represent the concept of  Christ as savior. However, he may have intended the actual name of  Christ, because the Protestant theologians of his era promoted the study  of Hebrew without vowels (points), a concept expressed in the full  title of Parkhurst’s lexicon (see Works Cited and Parkhurst, 1762, ECCO image 1). 
 
 Except for the top horizontal segment of letter “ת”‎ (22), which is reversed (red arrow), otherwise perfectly formed serif letters, right of center, identify the attacking serpent as Lilith, the female temptress-serpent-demon (illus. 3.7c). 
 
 Top center, very prominently engraved under the English slogan “The Angel of the Divine Presence,” are two words (illus. 3.7d): the tetragrammaton on the left, and “angel” on the right, but with a reversed “א”‎ (01) and a nearly cursive “מ”‎ (13). 
 
 
Finally, with all the above in mind, it is now possible to consider (a) the riddle posed by Blake’s misspelling “angel” in the Job plate by omitting letter “א”‎ (01) when he has it correct in the Laocoön; and (b) the enigma of the reversed letter “א”‎ (01) in a word that is so prominently and centrally displayed in the Laocoön. I begin by quoting Spector as representative of the scholarly discourse: 

Blake’s work is full of such inconsistencies, not only within single drawings, but among individual drawings as well. For example, at the top of “The Laocoön” is the heading “The Angel of the Divine Presence,” followed by a corrupt Hebrew version in which the alef [letter “א”‎ (01)] of the word “angel” is reversed …. In contrast, the identical phrase heads the … Job illustration, but here, Blake omits the alef entirely, leaving us with … the Hebrew word for “king”…. If we assume that Blake did not simply forget to include the alef, especially since he knew the word, then we must conclude that the corruption was deliberate, though the explanation for the alteration may defy our powers of analysis.Spector, “Blake as an Eighteenth-Century Hebraist” 202. Emphasis mine, except for the word “alef.” See also 225n40.
 The truth is sometimes to be found in the simplest theory (Occam’s razor). It may be, as G. E. Bentley, Jr., suggests, that Blake made errors when doing Hebrew.Bentley, William Blake’s Writings 1: 664n. How this could have occurred is suggested in a letter by John Linnell where we learn that the “borders [of the Job plates] were an afterthought, and designed as well as engraved upon the copper without a previous drawing” (emphasis mine).Bentley, The Stranger from Paradise 396. Because Blake worked on the Job borders extemporaneously, it is possible that he did the same when adding words to the Laocoön plate. Rosamund Paice so argues.Paice argues that the words were added late in Blake’s life: “The uneven spacing, and the mistakes, of the surrounding text suggest that it probably was scratched and/or engraved straight into the plate. … This suspicion is supported by the fact that the inscriptions (including the signature line) appear to have been cut with a graver, and not etched” (57). This may be the cause of the errors—surely, Blake was capable of human mistakes, no different from the many editors who attempt to reproduce his “ABC” “אבג‎” (see table 2). However, for those who cannot accept fallibility in Blake, I propose a more elaborate and speculative explanation. 
Who is, and where is, the angel in the two engravings? The answer is obvious in the Job plate (illus. 3.6), where Satan is front and center.Blake places Satan centrally in every Job engraving in which he appears. What could be more evident? Now examine the Laocoön (illus. 3.7). How is Satan depicted? He is clearly off to the side, entangled and helpless in the coils of Lilith, and identified as one of the two children of God (illus. 3.7a). Here, he is a minor character in the composition, unlabeled.Lilith is labeled (illus. 3.7c), but Satan and Adam are not. Consider the four figures, as Blake perceives them: God is not an angel—God is the creator; Lilith is a demon, certainly no angel; Adam is a man, also not an angel; Satan is the angel. Now examine the placement of the slogan (illus. 3.7d). It is not over the head of whichever of the two “sons” represents Satan, but directly above God, as it is in the Job engraving (illus. 3.6). Blake placed the English above the Hebrew, and the Hebrew above God, in both. Why above God, when it clearly refers to an angel, which could only be Satan? The answer, I suggest, is to consider that the Hebrew refers not to Satan at all, but only to God.
 
We now consider the illusion in each engraving. The Job engravings were published in 1826, and, by current judgment, the Laocoön is dated afterwards.For the history of the Laocoön and an analysis of the imagery, see Essick, Separate Plates xxvii, 98-101. However, for the most recent scholarship on its dating, see the William Blake Archive, which assigns a print date after the Job: “The central image of the statue may have been executed as early as c. 1815 …. The inscribed texts surrounding the statue were almost certainly added at a much later date, c. 1826-27.” “Print Date: c. 1826-27” (Illuminated Books, Laocoön, introduction and copy information for copy B, accessed 8 March 2010). Bentley dates it “1826?” (The Stranger from Paradise 463). Job: A person whose primary language is English will instinctively read from top left to bottom right, and on encountering the phrase “The Angel of the Divine Presence” will probably assume that the words immediately below are a Hebrew translation. The Hebraist will form the same assumption, then immediately realize upon reading the Hebrew that it has a different interpretation: 


  The Hebraist, expecting the equivalent of the English “The Angel of the Divine Presence,” instead perceives “Lord the King” (or “Jehovah the King”) and will be confounded. The meaning becomes clear, however, if the Hebrew phrase is associated with the image of God (“Lord the King”) immediately below, and not with Satan, as implied by the word “angel” in the slogan above. 
In this plate (illus. 3.6), Blake depicts three lines from the biblical plain text. Job 1.6, quoted in small letters at the very bottom of the plate,As Blake engraves it: “There was a day when the Sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord.” sets the stage. We see two parallel scenes: Heaven above, Earth below. In Heaven, a radiant God sits enthroned, an open book in his lap, attended by the “Sons of God,” all in contemplative study. On Earth, duplicating the heavenly tableau, a righteous Job with book in hand converses with angels, surrounded by his family, all in contemplative study.The heavenly scene is in Job 1.6. Blake includes the earthly scene because of Job 1.8. God calls Satan to account for his whereabouts; the latter replies that he was traveling the world (1.7: “And the Lord said unto Satan: ‘Whence comest thou?’ Then Satan answered the Lord, and said: ‘From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it’”).Soncino edition. Blake depicts this by showing a pensive God looking at Satan, who is in mid-stride. Next, in Job 1.8, God asks Satan: “Hast thou considered My servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a whole-hearted and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil?”Soncino edition. Blake shows this by words and image: the words are in an arc at the top of the plate, and the image shows God pointing down towards Job.Thereafter, in Job 1.9-12, Satan issues the challenge that God should test Job, and God authorizes Satan to so do (see note above). He further emphasizes God by engraving phrases above and below that refer to God in one manner or another. The composition of this plate, therefore, has God at the top and Job, a mortal on Earth, necessarily at the bottom. Only midpoint remains for Satan. Blake does not place Satan there because of his prominence and importance, but because of compositional demands. Satan is subordinate to God, who is paramount, and the focus is on God’s role in the Job story. This is the context necessary to understand the Hebrew slogan. 

Now we consider the three central title lines. All are about God. In an arc, Blake engraved “Hast thou considered my Servant Job,” the question posed by God. The second line identifies whom it is that God is addressing (see illus. 3.4, describing Satan as an “Angel”). The third, in Hebrew, labels the image of God. Associating Hebrew with God is not a new theme for Blake; three decades earlier, in Night Thoughts, he shows God with a scroll of Hebrew letters (see illus. 1.1), and the Hebrew slogan on the open book represents God, to whose heavenly realm the triumphant queen points (see illus. 1.4). The perception of a wrong translation is just an illusion caused by considering only the second and third lines without the overall context. It matters not if Blake deliberately or inadvertently created the illusion. If deliberate, the English reference to an angel would be a red herring to mislead the Hebraist. If inadvertent, we may imagine Blake’s surprise when a Hebraist complained that he erred because the Hebrew for “angel” (מלאך‎) is misspelled. Whichever, it is an illusion of a translation. By the overall context, Blake intended “king” (מלך‎), and that is what we see.
 
Laocoön: The Hebrew words with the largest letters act as a headline or banner to attract the eye. The non-Hebraist, for whom the words convey no meaning, will probably assume that the Hebrew is the equivalent of the English engraved immediately above: “The Angel of the Divine Presence.” The Hebraist will immediately understand the two Hebrew words as a phrase to mean “The Lord’s Angel” (or “Jehovah’s Angel”), a translation perfectly consistent with the English. 


  However, the Hebraist will simultaneously recognize that something is wrong, because the “א”‎ (01) is reversed. The reversal is a clue. Upon deliberately reconsidering the word with the offending letter deleted, the Hebraist will suddenly perceive “king” (מלך‎) in place of “angel” (מלאך‎). The translation becomes “Lord, the King,” a title consistent with the central figure of the Laocoön, whom Blake conceptualizes to be a representation of God. Spector supposes that Blake could not have erred because he knew the Hebrew words for “angel” and “king” (“Blake as an Eighteenth-Century Hebraist” 202). If not by error, then he did it for a purpose. I offer two suggestions for the reversed letter in the Laocoön. Perhaps Blake intended the Hebrew to convey a double meaning: “angel,” as a translation of the English slogan above, and “king,” as a label for the image below. It could, however, be another red herring to reinforce the illusion of a translation. Ignore the offending reversed letter, and the word becomes “king.” The critical concept is to recognize that the Hebrew banner is immediately above God, not above Satan, just as we see in the Job.Linnell studied Greek and Hebrew; his biographer, Alfred Thomas Story, tells of his learning Hebrew (and Greek) after conversion to the Baptist communion in 1812 in order to study the Bible. His teacher was Thomas Palmer, his future father-in-law, described as having “a good knowledge of Hebrew.” Story is of the opinion that “[Linnell] does not appear to have carried his studies very far … at that time, and they were probably soon relinquished.” In 1843, he resumed serious study and gained a degree of competence (Story vol. 1, ch. 5; vol. 2, ch. 7). On the relationship between Blake and Linnell, Story says: “A similarity of thought between the two men soon led to a very close intimacy between them, and they remained fast friends until the death of the elder closed as kindly a chapter of friendship as is anywhere to be met with in the annals of art or literature” (vol. 1, ch. 12). The modern revision of Story’s biography by Linnell’s great-grandson offers this comment about Linnell’s meeting Blake for the first time on 24 June 1818: “The two men seem to have taken to each other at once. Linnell was then twenty-six and Blake sixty-one. Their friendship lasted until Blake’s death, ten years later in 1827. Linnell was obviously fascinated by this man whose art and writings reflected so strongly a special image of God. He was surprised to discover that Blake too had learned Greek and Hebrew, and this immediately put their discussions about religion on a special footing” (D. Linnell 53). The implication of all this is that at the time that Blake was engraving the Job and the Laocoön Hebrew slogans, Linnell had some command of Hebrew (the extent of which is unknown). One may suspect that they discussed the Hebrew as work on the plates progressed. If discussions did occur, and if Linnell understood the difference in the Hebrew spelling of “king” and “angel,” then what Blake engraved was for a purpose. In the absence of documentary evidence, however, the vetting of Blake’s Hebrew by Linnell remains just an enticing speculation. Blake’s motive for introducing Hebrew wordplays into his art is argued in a forthcoming paper, Blake’s Priestly Blessing: God Blesses Job. 
Conclusion
 
These few samples of Blake’s Hebrew calligraphy may not be statistically representative or relevant. Considered in and of themselves, the images from the period before 1803 indicate a lack of command over the written character. Although the Butts watercolors demonstrate Blake’s great artistic mastery, they do not demonstrate mastery of the Hebrew alphabet. The Hebrew words from the Job and Laocoön engravings are properly formed, but imply a confusion in the spelling of the words “angel” and “king,” if not part of a deliberate illusion. Blake may also be distorting Hebrew characters for an ulterior purpose in support of a personal theology. His graphic representations of Hebrew show only what the eye can see, and tell no tale of how they came into being. If these specimens are typical of Blake’s written Hebrew, however, then they may be a measure of his command of the language.

R. Paul Yoder (rpyoder@ualr.edu)  is a professor of English at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.  He is the author of articles on Milton, Alexander Pope, Samuel  Richardson, Thomas Gray, Blake, and Wordsworth.  His book, The Narrative Structure of William Blake’s Poem Jerusalem: A Revisionist Interpretation, was published by the Edwin Mellen Press in 2010.  He has also co-edited, with Wallace Jackson, two essay collections on Pope.
 
 
 
In the past decade, we have seen examinations of the more marginal works (sometimes literally so) in William Blake’s oeuvre. For example, Blake’s epic Jerusalem has long been considered more or less his valedictory work, but in 2003’s The Traveller in the Evening: The Last Works of William Blake (Oxford), Morton Paley charted Blake’s productions after that supposed farewell, and in the process created a valuable introduction for readers interested in examining those relatively neglected materials.  In 2009 Hazard Adams offered a similar overview of Blake’s marginalia in Blake’s Margins: An Interpretive Study of the Annotations (McFarland).  In William Blake on His Poetry and Painting: A Study of A Descriptive Catalogue, Other Prose Writings and Jerusalem, Adams “continues the study of William Blake’s prose writings begun with Blake’s Margins” (1).  Poetry and Painting looks at Blake’s prose works with a particular focus on his remarks on art and poetry. Part I includes seven essays on, respectively, A Descriptive Catalogue, A Vision of the Last Judgment, A Public Address, On Homers Poetry and On Virgil, Laocoön, Blake’s letters, and “The Early Tractates.”  Part II comprises three essays, the first considering Blake’s attitudes on poetry, on his own poetry, and on other poets, the second on his prose and Jerusalem, and the third on his impact on William Butler Yeats and James Joyce.  There is some repetition of information, especially among the essays in part I; Adams acknowledges this, saying that “the book is designed so that readers, particularly students beginning study of Blake and readers more casually interested in his thought, may conveniently consult a particular chapter on a particular work” (1).  The book’s introductory intent is obviously valuable, but the more than casually interested reader could have wished for Adams to push a bit harder at these less commonly discussed works.
 
Most of the works on which Adams focuses were written after Blake’s return to London in late 1803 from his “three years slumber” at Felpham.  That time in Felpham was an important transitional period in Blake’s life, and that experience and the years afterward were key to the developments in his thinking that shaped The Four Zoas, Milton, and Jerusalem.  Much of this material has been covered elsewhere, as in the case of Laocoön, for example, which has been admirably discussed recently by both Paley in The Traveller in the Evening and Julia Wright in Blake, Nationalism, and the Politics of Alienation (Ohio University Press, 2004).  What Adams brings to the table is his own slant based on decades of work on Blake and on literary criticism, especially his emphasis on Blake’s antithetical method and on the importance of synecdoche in Blake’s thinking.  Moreover, the second essay of part II (“From the Prose to Jerusalem”) reproduces much of Adams’s important but largely neglected 1993 essay from Studies in Romanticism, while the final essay in the book (“From Jerusalem and the Prose to Yeats and Joyce”) similarly revisits earlier essays on those later writers.
 
Given that Adams intends only an introduction to these prose pieces,  it is not surprising that there is no overarching thesis to the book.   Still, two themes run throughout the discussion: 1. Synecdoche is a basic principle for Blake.  Adams references his own 1990 essay, “Synecdoche and Method,” from Antithetical Essays in Literary Criticism and Liberal Education (Florida State University Press) on this point, and in Poetry and Painting he says,  “Blake works almost always by synecdoche” (34) and indeed “thinks by  synecdoche” (58).  He explains that “the principle of synecdoche expresses for  Blake the identity of particular and universal” (52), and he identifies this  principle in Blake’s handling of the characters of Chaucer’s Canterbury pilgrims,  especially the Franklin (“[composed] of all Franklins” [26]), Blake’s use of “Britain as a microcosm of the world’s history” (40) in  the painting of The Ancient Britons, and Blake’s understanding of the Last Judgment (“the individual’s Last Judgment is a microcosm of the world’s” [51]). 2.  Many of the ideas expressed in the prose works that Adams considers are integrally related to ideas expressed in The Four Zoas, Milton, and Jerusalem.  He notes, for example, that “One thing is certain.  In painting The Ancient Britons and writing and etching Jerusalem, Blake was  producing what he thought was patriotic art, a mythological history of Britain …  antithetical to that of reasoning historians and politicians” (40).  About the picture of the Canterbury pilgrims, Adams suggests  that “Blake secretly injects into his picture symbols from his long poems”  (22), and he cites Orphea Jane Allen’s chart aligning particular pilgrims with  Blake’s Zoas as well as particular classical deities. Given his comments  on Chaucer’s Franklin, he could easily have added that Blake’s understanding of the pilgrims  provides much of the groundwork for the doctrine of “states” so important to Milton and Jerusalem. In his remarks on A Descriptive Catalogue, Adams compares Blake’s paintings of Nelson Guiding Leviathan, Pitt Guiding Behemoth, and the lost Spiritual Form of Napoleon to Jerusalem, in which “Blake calls Leviathan and Behemoth respectively ‘the War by Sea enormous and the War / By Land astounding’” (19).  Concerning A Public Address, Adams connects Blake’s criticism of Dryden and Pope as well as his declamatory approach in the Address with the first preface in Jerusalem, in which Blake attacks the “‘modern bondage of Rhyming’” and identifies “his own poetry with oratory” (64-65).  Indeed, the connection between Adams’s discussions of the prose works in part I and the three essays in part II depends on the continuity and development of Blake’s ideas about art from those prose works into his major later poetry.  Adams stipulates that “in order to observe [Blake’s] views of his own work and what he was attempting to do, a few ventures into Milton and Jerusalem will be necessary,” and then goes on to trace connections reaching from Blake’s “first engraved work, where he identifies the ‘true Man’ with the ‘Poetic Genius,’” through The Marriage of Heaven and Hell and the various prose works, and into the later poems in which “Blake identifies man with imagination and poetry with naming, implying language itself is in its nature poetic” (101).
 
Several discussions in Poetry and Painting are especially welcome.  Adams devotes an essay to the two tractates printed together, On Homers Poetry and On Virgil, which for some reason Paley had neglected in The Traveller in the Evening.  He compares Blake’s comments on unity in On Homers Poetry (“Every poem must necessarily be a perfect Unity, but why Homers is peculiarly so, I cannot tell”) to Aristotle’s discussion of unity of plot in Poetics (67-70).  He also notes, “When Blake speaks of Homer, he speaks of the fault of his poetry: its glorification of war and empire,” adding that as the “greatest of the classical poets,” Homer “stands, by synecdoche, for all ‘the Poetry of the Heathen Stolen and Perverted from the Bible not by Chance but by design’” (73).  Of both tracts Adams says, 

the mode of argument is enthymemic, that is, with parts left out, but implied by the fragment that remains.  It also appears that the two conclusions of the tractates are interchangeable.  I believe that both tractates have dramatic shapes and are deliberate efforts to go beyond the boundaries of abstract argumentation.  It is as if they have plot structures.  The form is one of search. (72)
 
The discussion of the prose inscriptions on three of Blake’s drawings for Dante’s Commedia is one of the strongest in the book.  Adams quotes, for example, Blake’s statement in the lower-right corner of Dante design 101, “Whatever Book is for Vengeance for Sin and whatever Book is Against the Forgiveness of Sins is not of the Father but of Satan the Accuser and Father of Hell [E690],” and then remarks, “The statement stands at the base of Blake’s beliefs in his late years. Nothing was more fundamental to his view of Jesus’s gospel” (122).
 
There are other gems scattered throughout the book. Adams offers a concise formulation of Blake’s critique of allegory: “The problem with allegory is, as we have seen, its false particularity” (57).  He calls Blake’s discussion of The Canterbury Tales in A Descriptive Catalogue “arguably the most important criticism of Chaucer between that of John Dryden, who in his Fables Ancient and Modern (1700) revived Chaucer’s reputation, which had fallen in the seventeenth century, and Matthew Arnold’s essay in The Study of Poetry  (1880)” (21). On the “fundamental difference” between Blake and Yeats, he says, 

Blake is radically humanistic and is totally devoted to a vision of this world as potentially apocalyptic through an improvement in mental power and cleansing of error.  Yeats is also humanistic, and his antithetical man opts for such a vision.  But at the same time Yeats concludes that a humanistic apocalypse is, if not impossible, at most only momentary and mysterious. … Like Blake’s, Yeats’s view is cyclical, but for Blake Yeats’s vision is only of the fallen cycle. (171-72)
 Concerning Blake’s impact on Joyce, Adams observes, 
[Robert] Gleckner accurately observes that Joyce finally departed from Blake, thinking that Blake’s work finally was blind to “the grubby realities of this world, [leading] to an ‘idealism’ so absolute that there was no room for the Blooms and Mollys, the Finnegans and the Earwickers” ….  I think, if Gleckner is right, Joyce was wrong about this, for Blake was never that kind of idealist and his reality was not an elsewhere. (183)
 
There are some problems with the book.  Compared to Adams’s other work, Poetry and Painting can be a bit dry.  Sometimes the phrasing is not  quite right.  For example, on the relationship between poetry and prophecy, Adams  says, “Poetry is prophecy, not prediction.  It is insight into things; its role  is to reshape the fallen world, which is a congeries of human error, into an image so  clear that error will be seen for what it is and thus annihilated”  (103).  The second sentence here is certainly correct, but the phrasing of the first sentence seems backward; better to say, “Prophecy is poetry, not  prediction.”  Also, the documentation on the longer poems is a bit confusing; the  references do not follow the standard format of plate and line number, but instead  indicate only chapter and plate, without noting particular lines.
 
These are small points, however.  The strength in this book lies in the gathering together of Adams’s take on Blake’s attitudes toward poetry and painting, and the relationship of those attitudes to the work of key figures before and after Blake.

In 2011 a stained-glass window commemorating Blake’s three-year residence on the Sussex coast was consecrated in the parish church of St. Mary’s, Felpham. A Norman building dating to c. 1100, St. Mary’s is a short walk from the thatched cottage that Blake and Catherine occupied between 1800 and 1803. The Blake memorial window was commissioned by St. Mary’s parish council in 2007 and was funded by the generous contributions of Felpham parishioners and Blake enthusiasts and by donations raised through local charitable events celebrating the 250th anniversary of Blake’s birth. The window was designed by the artist Meg  Lawrence, whose work also includes painting with an egg-based tempera medium on wood panels, a  medium similar to the one that Blake used, with animal glue and gum  Arabic as the binding agents instead of egg, for some of his 1799 illustrations of the  Bible.For more information on Lawrence’s painting techniques, see http://www.​radnorshire.​com/​introduction.​html. For Blake’s tempera, see William Blake: The Painter at Work, ed. Joyce H. Townsend (London: Tate Publishing, 2003) 113-14.
  
An experienced stained-glass artist and conservator, Lawrence has designed many windows for parish churches throughout England and Ireland. They are made using entirely traditional materials and techniques of painting and manufacture. Of crucial importance is the use of mouth-blown glass of the highest possible quality, made at a small factory in Bavaria. Much of the glass that she works with is blown to her own specification, giving exactly the colors and graduated tones required. She also employs flashed glass, which adds a very thin layer of colored glass over a thicker layer, thereby giving the opportunity to manipulate the colors further by the use of acid etching. Colored glass, cut for the window, is painted and fired in the kiln up to three times to build up layers of drawing, shading, pattern, and texture. The windows are assembled using lead cames. One of her painting techniques is the use of linear brush-strokes, a method of draftsmanship that Blake famously champions in his Descriptive Catalogue: “The great and golden rule of art, as well as of life,  is this: That the more distinct, sharp, and wirey the bounding line, the  more perfect the work of art” (E 550).
 
Lawrence’s overall design combines figurative Christian iconography with recognizable Blakean motifs and centers on two male figures with halo-like auras and feathered wings. These are angels of creation rising from the sea to the heavens (illus. 1 and 2).

 Above and below the angels is a scroll containing text from verses 1 and 24 of Psalm 104. Each angel holds a sphere, a familiar device in Blake’s visual language, within which are various smaller designs. The sphere held by the angel decorating the right panel contains images of the sea and the beasts of the forest, including a Blakean tiger. The sphere held by the angel on the left panel contains images of birds, fish, the sea and sand or earth, and a male and female wearing long, flowing robes tied at the waist with golden bands. These figures are postlapsarian Adam and Eve, facing each other in poses that compositionally recall Blake’s watercolor The Judgment of Adam and Eve: “So Judged He Man” (c. 1807-08; Butlin 529.10 and 536.10) from the two series of designs illustrating Milton’s Paradise Lost. Either side of Adam and Eve are two circles that represent the sun (to the left of Adam) and the moon (to the right of Eve). Within the circle to the right of Eve is a crescent shape that recalls Blake’s depiction of a crescent moon as a darkened circle with an illuminated crescent in Satan Watching the Endearments of Adam and Eve (c. 1807-08; Butlin 529.5 and 536.4) and the crescent moon in the sixth woodcut from the illustrations to Robert Thornton’s The Pastorals of Virgil (1821). 
Beneath the angels are self-contained pictures, known as predellas (illus. 3 and 4).

 The upper predellas are surrounded by decorative borders incorporating the first four lines of Auguries of Innocence and passionflowers, and contain designs representing the minute particulars of life: a pasqueflower, various insects, and assorted marine life. The lower predellas form the base of the window and depict the sixth woodcut from Blake’s illustrations to Thornton’s Pastorals and “Blake’s Cottage at Felpham” from plate 36 of Milton. 
Either side of the lower predellas are decorative panels containing twisting vines and blooming flowers that evoke the interlinear designs of Blake’s illuminated books. The panel next to the image of Blake’s cottage includes the following verse from Catherine Blake’s letter to Ann Flaxman of 14 September 1800: “Away to Sweet Felpham for Heaven is there / The Ladder of Angels descends thro the air” (E 709). The panel buttressing the image of Blake’s Virgil woodcut bears the legend: “The Visionary, Poet and Painter, William Blake (1757-1827) lived in the village of Felpham from 1800 to 1803.”
 
It is not known if the Blakes attended St. Mary’s during their residence on the south coast, although Blake did include the church tower in his unfinished watercolor Landscape near Felpham (c. 1800; Butlin 368). The window is located in the south chancel wall, overlooking the area where couples exchange marriage vows. It was installed in late 2010 and dedicated by the dean of Chichester in May 2011.

The Eye sees more than the Heart knowsBlake, Visions of the Daughters of Albion, title page (Johnson and Grant 70; all citations of Blake’s poems are from this edition, unless otherwise specified).
 
The Book of Urizen as a rewriting, or reinterpretation, of  the Genesis myth has long been important to Blake studies in terms of  understanding the very crux of Blakean mythology and the nature of what  has come to be known as Blake’s bible.See, in particular, David Worrall’s introduction to The Urizen Books. He describes The Book of Urizen as Blake’s effort to ask “when, why and how man’s ideas of God and religion came into existence” (10).  By essentially reading the act of “genesis” (what one might normally  associate with an establishment of order and origin) as a kind of  reverse creation myth, Blake suggests in Urizen that the birth  of humanity emerges at the moment of its fall. Hence, what was once a  story of creation out of chaos becomes for Blake a visionary apocalypse.  I use the term “visionary” here not simply because Urizen acts  as Blake’s artistic vision of man’s genesis, but because, for Blake,  the nature of our origins as apocalypse is dependent upon the fall of  our perceptions, on a collapse of both human and divine vision.  If  the Blakean fall predates an exile of humanity from paradise, then it  becomes divine in origin, stemming from acts of godly creation. Blake’s  radical mythology essentially can be read as a critique of aesthetics  and of our standards of both divine and artistic creation. We know from  the original Genesis myth that divine creation arises out of God’s  command “Let there be light.” However, Blake’s anti-Genesis begins and  ends in obscurity, in a world devoid of light that remains in darkness  throughout all of Urizen’s acts of creation. Therefore, we can read The Book of Urizen as a story of blindness, or of the relationship that emerges between man and God as both lose their ability to perceive fully. 
 
Of course, Blake’s preoccupation with sight extends beyond his biblical poems. In turning to an analysis of Urizen, we might recall the opening epigraph on the title page of Visions of the Daughters of Albion,  “The Eye sees more than the Heart knows.” Here, Blake plays with our  concept of vision by destabilizing the traditional association of sight  with knowledge. If the language of prophecy is dependent upon foresight,  a knowledge that stems from visionary perception, then the eye’s  perceptions might dictate the knowledge of the mind or heart. However,  in Visions Blake suggests that we see more than we  know, or, in other words, we never internalize all of our perceptions.  This is a phenomenon that can be explained through the narrative of  Urizenic genesis, a myth that seeks to unfold the story of man’s  emergence into a world of “narrowing perceptions.” More importantly, in  the epigraph for Visions, it is not the mind that knows, but rather it is the heart  that becomes the primary organ of thought. Thus Blake associates  feeling with thinking. Ironically, the heart, an organ that comes to  represent feeling as thinking, also fails to feel and/or think  adequately through acts of visionary perception. Why then does Blake  perceive the heart as blind? This is a question that can be explained in  light of Urizen.
 
Once we understand The Book of Urizen as dependent upon a  narrative of thwarted perceptions, we note the immediate connection  between Urizen, or “your reason,” and a critique of Enlightenment  thinking. At the center of Blake’s dark conception of the Enlightenment  lies an eighteenth-century preoccupation with sentiment, and thus we  begin to see how Blake’s critique of reason ties into matters of the  heart. Moreover, we begin to associate Urizen, a book that  links allegorical reason to divine creation and thereby to ideologies of  genesis and origin, with eighteenth-century philosophies of the self.  Both the ontological and aesthetic implications of the poem shed light  on Blake’s ongoing desire to expose the hypocrisy of eighteenth-century  theories of sensibility, a topic that a number of Blake critics, James  Chandler and Stephen Cox in particular, have begun to explore in their  work.
 
I would like to argue, more specifically, that we can read The Book of Urizen  as Blake’s commentary on the moral and structural failings of sympathy,  a phenomenon associated with philosophies of sensibility and one that  Blake sees as an identificatory process that tricks the imagination into  false perception. Hence, we can account for the strong relationship in  the poem between sight and the cognitive dissonances that arise out of a  Blakean conception of pity. In particular, I would like to read Blake’s  critique of pity in The Book of Urizen, which critics such as  Cox have connected with issues of division in the poem, as standing in  direct opposition to eighteenth-century theories of sympathy found in  Humean and Smithian moral philosophies of subjectivity and aesthetic  judgment.  In other words, for Blake, sympathy as a sentiment that  distorts or tricks our real perceptions is perverse in that it creates  only imagined, or illusory, union. By striving for conformity, sympathy  ultimately blinds us, creating only division and solipsism where it  seeks to unite. Thus Blake’s world of “narrowing perceptions” at the end  of the poem is the result not only of Urizenic genesis but of a kind of  creation that arises out of man’s distorted perception, out of a  paradoxical “pity” that Blake reads as man’s perverse desire to seek for  himself in others by simultaneously likening himself to and distancing  himself from them. 
 
Ironically, the identificatory desire to unite to another subject  results for Blake only in a doubling of the self, in a mimetic  self-reproduction reliant on projection. Blake’s Urizenic world is  founded upon sympathy, upon the mirrorings of the self, which seeks to  find itself, reproduce itself, in everything. Although the Urizenic  world is one that begins in isolation, with the creator brooding on his  own, Urizen ultimately creates a society founded on the laws of “unity,”  “pity, compassion, [and] forgiveness” (4.34-35). Thus Urizen’s world  defies the Blakean ideals of individualism by seeking for itself in  others, by imagining unity where none exists, and thereby creating only  nonproductive mimesis and division. 
 
Critics have long acknowledged Blake’s critique of pity in the Songs of Innocence and of Experience: “Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody Poor” (“The Human Abstract”).The other representation of pity that has occupied Blake critics over time is the color print Pity, which is analyzed by David Bindman in William Blake: His Art and Times. The design has been interpreted as illustrative of the following lines from Shakespeare’s Macbeth: And pity, like a naked new-born babe, Striding the blast, or heaven’s cherubim hors’d Upon the sightless couriers of the air Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye, That tears shall drown the wind. Bindman relates the conceptions of pity in The Book of Urizen to the allegorical design, arguing that in both pity appears as a negative emotion, which in Urizen  arises out of Los’s pity for Urizen. Pity causes Los’s division (into  the two sexes) and the consequent separation of Enitharmon and Los  (115-16). An anxiety about the repression of sensory perception also pervades the Songs, most particularly “To Tirzah,” which shares with Urizen the apocalyptic fear that emerges from a binding of the senses. Nevertheless, my focus in this essay will be on The Book of Urizen, for two reasons. First, critics have focused less on the topic of sympathy in Urizen than in Blake’s other poetry, and, second, Urizen  as Blake’s rewriting of the Genesis myth specifically critiques  theories of sympathy because of their connection to mimetic models of  thinking, perceiving, and creating.
 
In this manner, Blake’s critique of sympathy in The Book of Urizen  most likely arises out of the aesthetic and subjective issues that stem  from eighteenth-century conceptions of sympathy and the self. His  critique focuses upon both the social consequences of sympathy and the  philosophical rhetoric and structure that empiricists use to describe  acts of sympathetic identification. If we turn, for example, to some of  the major philosophies of sympathy in Blake’s time, we see that at the  heart of this discourse lies a larger implication for both aesthetics  and the psychology of the individual, an implication that stands in  direct conflict with some of Blake’s own moral preoccupations. One of  Blake’s greatest issues with sympathy as theorized in the late  eighteenth century is that it is founded upon a false sense of unity, on  an imagined, as opposed to a real, psychological bond. 
 
Most importantly, this imagined connection relies upon a restriction  of the senses, or rather a relationship in which thought, or reason,  supersedes sensory perception. In his Treatise of Human Nature,  Hume foregrounds his commentary on the imaginative work of sympathy by  discussing the relationship between sensation and reason, or what he  calls “impressions” and “ideas”: 

All the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves  into two distinct kinds, which I shall call IMPRESSIONS and IDEAS. The  difference betwixt these consists in the degrees of force and  liveliness, with which they strike upon the mind, and make their way  into our thought or consciousness. Those perceptions, which enter with  most force and violence, we may name impressions; and under  this name I comprehend all our sensations, passions and emotions, as  they make their first appearance in the soul. By ideas I mean the faint images of these in thinking and reasoning …. (7)
 For Hume, an “impression” is a kind of perception that is also a  sensation, an act of vision that instantly gives rise to a bodily,  emotional reaction. An “idea,” on the other hand, not only becomes a  conceptualization, or a memory, of our impression, but also a mimesis of  this impression. “When I shut my eyes and think of my chamber,” Hume  writes, “the ideas I form are exact representations of the  impressions I felt …” (8). Therefore, for Hume, there is something  inherently mimetic about thinking; our ideas are replicas of our  reality, and what is real is primarily based upon both sight and sensory  experience. Moreover, Hume states that “in sympathy there is an evident  conversion of an idea into an impression” (208). Thus Hume illustrates a  chain of mimetic responses in which impressions become ideas and ideas  become impressions. Affections such as sympathy, he argues, rely less  upon an immediate sensory experience than they do on the faculties of  our memory and imagination. Sympathy as a kind of affection becomes a  function of the imagination. We feel sympathy, argues Hume, not through  direct sensory experience but from a faint mimesis, a recollection, of  our former sensations. This is to say that sympathetic bonds arise not  from sensory perceptions but from the reproductive, mimetic work of the  mind. 
Smith explains the imaginative nature of sympathy through a similar  rhetoric. Here, we can further grasp why sympathy as an affective bond  with another being must rely upon the mimetic faculties of the mind  rather than upon any direct or immediate sensation: 

Though our brother is upon the rack, as long as we  ourselves are at ease, our senses will never inform us of what he  suffers. They never did, and never can, carry us beyond our own person,  and it is by the imagination only that we can form any conception of  what are his sensations. Neither can that faculty help us to this any  other way, than by representing to us what would be our own, if we were  in his case. It is the impressions of our own senses only, not those of  his, which our imaginations copy. (The Theory of Moral Sentiments 11-12)
 We cannot, according to Smith, directly experience the emotions of another person. In  order to experience those emotions in acts of sympathy, we place a map  of our former impressions and sensations onto another subject.According to Chandler in “Blake and the Syntax of Sentiment,” The Theory of Moral Sentiments argues that to sympathize with a person is “not  to feel what that person feels,” but “rather to feel what we ourselves  should feel in a like situation.” In this manner, sympathy relates to  performance. When we sympathize, we “feel what it would be like  to be that person,” and thus we enter into that person’s state or  situation by way of imitation (106). However, Chandler argues, to put  oneself into the case of another “requires a … remediation of oneself in  relation to all that is not oneself” (107). This includes one’s body.  When we pity, we imagine a virtual set of circumstances with which to  identify; thus pity becomes “an act of disembodiment and (at the same  time) of virtual reembodiment.” “Thus to become an object of sympathetic  identification,” Chandler writes, “is to have one’s experience mediated  in two related senses” (107), between “the universal and the  particular,” and “rendered” so as to admit “virtual” and imaginative  experience. For Blake, Chandler claims, sympathy is not a matter of  sympathetic imagination, i.e., of putting oneself into the case of  another, or imagining what it would be like to be them. Rather, he  argues that for Blake sympathy becomes a matter of characters  “metamorphosing into one another” (112). According to Chandler, Blake  attempts to “denaturalize the level of habitual reflection and exchange  that marks the sentimental” (116). Here is where I wish to depart from Chandler’s analysis. His model seeks  to establish a Blakean ideal for sympathy, whereas I read Urizen  as an outright argument against the evils of sympathetic  identification. There is no need, Blake seems to say, to eradicate  difference, a desire that seems to lie at the heart of the late  eighteenth-century’s preoccupation with sensibility. The Book of Urizen, I argue, rejects Smithian sympathy as a form of self-doubling or projection.  Smithian sympathy is necessarily reliant on imaginative projection; the  sympathizer tries to conform the experiences of the sympathetic object  to his own in order to establish a sense of likeness. Such a case would  point not to an imaginative transport into the object but rather to a kind of imaginative projection onto  the object of one’s pity. For Smith, not only is sympathy a function of  the imagination, but it acts as a repetition of the self; it relies on  mimesis. We can see how for Blake this mimetic aspect of sympathy might  appear solipsistic. If we were to read Smith via, or in conjunction  with, Hume, then sympathy might look like a doubly mimetic process; in  sympathy, we take an idea, a replica of an initial impression that we  experienced in the past, in an attempt to mimic the unknown sentiments  of another. Thus the sympathetic bond describes an act of mimetic  mapping; a doubly reproduced sensation creates an illusory connection.  In contrast to the image-making faculties of Blakean creation or  thought, eighteenth-century theories of sympathy thereby define the  imagination as something that never creates but only reproduces or  copies sensation. This notion seems to highlight the generally  solipsistic nature of a work like The Book of Urizen, which is, as many critics have argued, dependent upon narcissistic forms of reproduction, on “a continual reproduction of selfhood,” as Paul Mann states.Mann 56. 
For Blake, it is the mimetic properties of sympathy, along with its connection to the mind, the imagination, and the self, that violate an artistic code of originality and a moral paradigm of individualism.This  vision of sympathy for Blake as an “imagined” or “thought-constructed”  act that gives rise to division where it intends to unite becomes  further emphasized in his use of the term “pity.” Pity as a type of  sympathy only emphasizes a need for difference as well as hierarchy in  order to produce an illusory feeling of likeness. See Smith’s definition  of pity as closely aligned with the nature of sympathy, but exclusive  to feelings of sorrow or misery (Smith 13). According to Smith,  therefore, we can read pity as a mere subclassification of sympathy,  which is how I intend to use this term with regard to Blake. Finally,  note also Hume’s definition of pity (Hume 238-40). For Hume, pity, like  sympathy, functions as an imaginative faculty, not a real bond or  likeness, which is (as in Smith’s analysis of sympathy) triggered by sight and therefore connected to our powers of thought and perception. The  threat of a Humean or Smithian conception of sympathy connected to the  mimetic faculties of the imagination could only disturb any Blakean  ideals of originality and individual subjectivity as seen in both his  poetry and his method of printing.See Joseph Viscomi’s article “Illuminated Printing” from the William Blake Archive,  in which he describes the unique process behind Blake’s method of  printing. For the aesthetic implications behind Blake’s artistic  process, see also note 29. Thus Blake represents sympathy in The Book of Urizen  as a reproduction of the self that breeds division in its attempt to  unite. Moreover, the Urizenic mind must reproduce its own past  sensations, must essentially form a double of itself that is then  projected outward, divided from the self, in order to create the sympathetic bond.
 
Late eighteenth-century philosophers of sympathy link it to  spectatorship, arguing that sight always triggers sympathetic reactions;  thus our perceptions become a key aspect of all acts of sympathetic  bonding. Hume classifies “impressions” and “ideas” as “perceptions of  the … mind” and therefore suggests that sympathy acts as a hybrid  idea-impression, as a function of the imagination and as a kind of  perception. For Smith, the sympathetic plight of the spectator arises  out of a visual perception of a situation that triggers an emotional  response that intends to capture or mimic the would-be emotions of the  sympathetic object. Blake acknowledges this aspect of the sympathetic  discourse when he places recurrent emphasis throughout The Book of Urizen  on images and acts of perception. Even the very first word of the poem  (after its Preludium) serves as a perfect introduction to the importance  of sight in the narrative of Urizen’s material genesis: “Lo, a  shadow of horror is risen / In Eternity! Unknown, unprolific?” (3.1-2;  emphasis mine). “Lo” here, of course, can mean “low” as in something  base, dark, and obscure rising upward. However, we could also read “Lo” as a kind of elided articulation of the phrase “lo and behold.”“Lo”  can also be read as a pun on the name and figure of Los in the poem. In  “The Meaning of Los,” Edward J. Rose argues that “Los” should be  interpreted as the “traditionally shortened form of the interjection,  ‘lo.’” In this sense, we should read the name of Los, who fittingly  becomes the figure of the prophet in Blake’s Urizen, as meaning to “‘look’ or ‘behold’” (10).  Thus the poem immediately asks us to see, to behold, this vision; it  places Urizen in the position of something viewed, an object awaiting  sympathy. To some extent, Urizen already loses a kind of individual  agency here, even as a divine power. Not only does Blake figure him in  the first stanza as a spectacle that calls forth our attention, but he  also describes Urizen as essentially “unknown.” Urizen becomes known  only to the extent that he is called “Urizen”: “Some said / ‘It is  Urizen’” (3.5-6).
 
In this initial act of naming, Blake emphasizes our desire, or the  desire of the Eternals, to comprehend Urizen through a strained act of  perception. Here, Blake acknowledges the assumption that seeing is  knowing, and that an assumed piece of knowledge always leads to a  secondary desire: one of naming, defining, and incidentally confining  the unknown. This points to the very predicament of the original  Genesis myth, in which speaking and naming (in terms of both God’s  declarative fiat lux and Adam’s status as he who names all  things) become essential to the process of material creation. The  paradox here, of course, lies in Blake’s and the Eternals’ asking us to  see something that has no material form, for at the opening of the poem  the concept of Urizen exists in a pre-Genesis state of chaos. Urizen is  unshapen, a void, an essence, something, therefore, “unseen” and  “unknown” (3.10), which already indicates our desire to “see,” to  “know,” and to sympathize with him. Los becomes in the poem the “Eternal  Prophet” and thus the ultimate “seer.” Incidentally, it is Los too who  as seer, and as craftsman or creator, will play the role of the  quintessential sympathizer, reproducing, producing, dividing, and  creating throughout his continual acts of pity. Hence, the opening of  the poem poses a threat of perception, which foreshadows a subsequent  threat of sympathetic bondage for Blake.
 
Notably, we exit the pre-genesis state of  Urizen and fall into materiality only when he introduces “Laws of peace,  of love, of unity” into creation,Cox  reads Urizen’s desire to put into effect “Laws of peace, of love, of  unity: / Of pity, compassion, forgiveness” as Urizen’s establishment of  the rules of sensibility. He argues that Los’s attempt to limit Urizen  involves him in a Urizenic excess of sensibility. When Los observes  Urizen, pity divides his soul. Blake, states Cox, is “aware of the  overcompensating element in the eighteenth century’s ability to generate  an ethic of sympathy from its fear of solipsism.” Thus, when Los  experiences sympathy for Urizen, this creates a division, an anguish of  being rent from Urizen’s side. Sympathy in The Book of Urizen thus acts as a “failed attempt to use feeling for others to recover from a perceived absence of those others” (153-54).  an act that Blake describes as a darkness unfolding (4.31-35). Hence,  sympathy becomes an event of false enlightenment, a Miltonic fall into  “darkness visible.” Stanzas 8 and 9 of chapter 3  connect this notion of sensual bondage to sympathy with the introduction  of Los, a formerly silent bystander who intervenes and emerges in  accordance with his role as the sympathetic spectator:According to Harold Bloom, pity enters into The Book of Urizen  through the character of Los, whose dismay at the disaster suffered  through Urizen’s solipsistic intellect prompts him to action. Urizen,  when contemplating his creation, “weeps hypocritical tears of abstract  pity.” His weeping is thus akin to the mercy of a destructive God. “As  in ‘The Human Abstract,’” Urizenic pity “breeds monstrous growth,”  argues Bloom (174). 

And Los round the dark globe of Urizen Kept watch for Eternals to confine The obscure separation alone; For Eternity stood wide apart, As the stars are apart from the earth.  Los wept howling around the dark Demon: And cursing his lot; for in anguish, Urizen was rent from his side. (5.38-41; 6.1-4)
 Los’s immediate perception, or prophecy, arises from his role as  Urizen’s guardian. (We might compare Los here to the Miltonic angel or  demon who keeps watch.) This initial perception both predicts and  reifies Urizen’s confinement. In the horrifying spectacle of Urizen’s creation,Morton D. Paley argues in “Spectre and Emanation” that Los’s endeavor to save Albion in Jerusalem  is actually an endeavor “to reintegrate his … spectre with his  emanation” (150). Again, we see a problematic between internality and  externality in Blake. What represents external relations may also  represent internal struggles and relations. Thus the nerves and fibers  of the Urizenic origin create a world with very few boundaries, which  through a solipsistic form of creation exists as a kind of universality,  a connective tissue that unites and binds the individual to himself and  to his surroundings. his markedly demonic and solipsistic  separation, Blake introduces Los as the perpetuator of separation and  division in the poem. Los’s “pity” for Urizen separates the two. Just as  Urizen’s laws of pity force him to divide from the Eternals, Los’s  sentiments of sympathy divide him from Urizen. Hence, Blake begins to  establish a concrete relationship between pity and division: “Los wept howling around the dark Demon: / And cursing his lot; for in anguish, / Urizen was rent from his side” (6.2-4).Worrall  argues that “Los is ‘rent’ from Urizen’s side in a way analogous to  Eve’s division from Adam. … Los then subdivides into a female form  (Enitharmon)” (10). See also note 19.  Despite Los’s lamentations, Urizen remains a formless mass that, divided  from the Eternals and Los, is “Unorganiz’d, rent from Eternity”  (6.8).  Nonetheless, the image or sight of an “unorganiz’d” Urizen  only increases Los’s pity. These lamentations eventually heal Los  himself, although they fail to heal Urizen: “Los howld in a dismal  stupor, / Groaning! gnashing! groaning! / Till the wrenching apart was  healed. / But the wrenching of Urizen heal’d not” (7.1-4). Such a  representational analysis of pity recalls what Blake sees as the  self-serving, self-projecting forces of a Smithian conception of  sympathy. In Blake’s world, the consequences of sympathy result only in a  self-mimetic, solipsistic form of materialization in which the  sympathizer “forms” the other subject out of the substance of his own  sentiment. As Urizen “heal[s] not” and Los’s pity is again aroused,  sympathy leads to the formation of Urizen’s body, a binding of his  previously formless senses. Such an ending to chapter 3 is not  surprising, since Blake intends to reveal pity as a self-serving emotion  that never succeeds in healing or helping the object of one’s sympathy.  Not only, therefore, do Los’s sympathetic lamentations create division,  but they also facilitate the fall of the Urizenic world into  materiality. 
Chapter 3 concludes with a petrific image of  Los’s horror at the sight of Urizen, a vision that forms the basis of  the illustration on plate 7 (illus. 1),For  a substantial analysis of the imagery of these plates, see Worrall’s  “Themes and Contexts” (32-34; pls. 6 and 7 in copy D, reproduced in  Worrall). which concludes with the lines “Till Los rouz’d his fires, affrighted / At the formless unmeasurable death” (7.8-9).

 Here Blake depicts Los surrounded by fire and in an enclosed, womb-like  posture, with his circular mouth open. In this position, Los binds his  own body, with his arms overlapped and intertwined in front of his  chest. Chapter 4 then begins with the formation of Urizen’s skeletal  structure. Fittingly, the image on plate 8 of Urizen’s new body (illus.  2) seems to mirror the image of Los on plate 7.

 Blake depicts the bones that Los shapes and binds into “nets and gins”  (in order to embody Urizen) as a skeleton encircled in a fetal  position, suggestive of rebirth but also of the womb-like position as a  kind of enclosure. Even the words on plates 7 and 8 suggest a kind of  bondage, with vines (or veins) circling the text of the poem like its  own etched “nets and gins.” Notably, Blake figures Los, the Eternal  Prophet, as a craftsman whose creation acts as a mimesis of himself. Blake thus critiques the association of creation with imitation,Mann and David Simpson connect this mimetic process of regeneration and creation to the masturbatory language that abounds in The Book of Urizen.  Christopher Hobson accounts for Blake’s views on masturbation in  conjunction with his views on narcissistic/mimetic reproduction as  fitting with those of his time. Masturbation, Hobson argues, is  condemned as a form of non-reproductive sexuality, as something that  generates nothing, or at least nothing new (39). particularly in  relation to the original Genesis myth, which highlights God’s desire to  create man in his own image. Most importantly, when Los creates, or  forms, Urizen’s body, he does so out of an act of pity. Thus Urizen’s  embodiment once again narrates a Smithian theory of sympathy as Los  projects himself onto the object of his pity. Urizen becomes a  supposedly new conception of thought, which is actually derived from a  double (or division) of Los’s own self. Here, the imagination as a  creative faculty serves only to reproduce and mimic but never to create  anew. Essentially, the formation of Urizen’s body  becomes a narrative of sensual bondage that critiques  eighteenth-century theories of sympathy as they relate to new,  philosophical conceptions of reason and its relationship to aesthetics.When  I use the term “aesthetic” here, I refer to its eighteenth-century use  as a “feeling,” sentiment, or “affect.” See definition 1 in the OED, which associates the aesthetic with “sensuous perception.”  The changes that Urizen experiences in the binding of his senses can be  read as an eighteenth-century triumph of ideas over impressions (or a Kantian departure from empiricism)See Kant’s account of the sublime in the second book of the first part of the Critique of the Power of Judgment.  in which the awakening of reason attempts to make up for the  restriction of the senses. Urizen’s embodiment indicates the  anti-empirical formation of a new world conception of reason in which  thought separates from sensory experience. Thus Blake emphasizes  Urizen’s “eternal name” as though this original name has been perverted  somehow with the changes of “Urizen.” 
In the new world of Urizen, reason is now misinterpreted for Blake as  something connected to pity and the laws of sympathy or affect: 

And Urizen (so his eternal name) His prolific delight obscurd more and more In dark secresy, hiding in surgeing Sulphureous fluid his phantasies. The Eternal Prophet heavd the dark bellows, And turn’d restless the tongs; and the hammer Incessant beat; forging chains new and new, Numb’ring with links, hours, days and years. (10.11-18)
 Here, Urizen struggles against Los’s desire to bind and embody him by  continually attempting to hide his self, or his “phantasies,” in  “sulphureous fluid.” The “sulphureous fluid” implies images both of  masturbation and of the amniotic fluid of Urizen’s rebirth, but it also  emphasizes fluidity as indicative of formlessness. We recall the opening  to The Book of Urizen, when Urizen as free-floating sensation is defined by his lack of form. 
In this stanza we also see the creation of time, which Los fashions  in the image of a chain. Thus temporality, like materiality, for Blake  indicates a kind of bondage definitive of the earthly, human world. Los  not only forges temporality by dividing it into the subdivisions of  hours, days, and years, thereby associating creation with mimesis or  division, but he also “numb’r[s]” the divisions like the links on a  chain. Blake’s use of the word “numb’ring,” in which he elides the “e,”  creates a pun on the act of counting. The forging, or material bondage,  of time not only indicates Los’s attempt to number and divide, but also  points to the numbing (“numb-ring”) of sensory experience. Hence, Blake  reiterates in Los’s act of creative division a triumph of ratiocination  over sensation, a war in which the logic of time overrides empirical  being through a stifling of the senses.
 
Plates 11-13 continue to associate “numb-ring,” or measuring, with  the numbing of sensory experience. Here, time is measured out in the  seven ages of “dismal woe” that all arise with the stages of Urizen’s  literal embodiment. Once again, his formation is figured as a binding of  sensory perception. Perhaps the most significant age of sensory bondage  is the third, which illustrates the material creation of Urizen’s eyes: 

His nervous brain shot branches Round the branches of his heart On high into two little orbs And fixed in two little caves Hiding carefully from the wind, His Eyes beheld the deep, And a third Age passed over: And a state of dismal woe. (11.11-18)
 Blake’s depiction of the eyes recalls both the opening assertion of Visions,  in which “the Eye sees more than the Heart knows,” and a Humean account  of sympathy. In Blake’s description, the branches of the brain strangle  and bind the branches of the heart. Thus we encounter a Blakean  critique of Hume’s theories of affect and perception. Such eyes that  “hid[e] carefully from the wind” are modeled after a notion of  perception derived from reason’s attempt to perform the work of the  heart: hence Hume’s conception of affect as an idea that mimics (so as  to become) impression. As the senses attempt and yet fail to branch out,  or break free, from Urizen’s bodily bondage, the formation of ears,  eyes, nostrils, a throat and tongue gives rise to new phases “of dismal  woe”; thus the senses embodied become eras that indicate the triumph of  “your reason” over sensual perception. The association of measurement  and “numb-ring” with sensual bondage indicates that Urizen’s fall into  materiality becomes a fall from sensory perception into an idea-based  type of perception, or, more specifically, a fall into judgment. 
Smith chooses to associate judgment, a cognitive discernment of difference,See OED, “judgment,” definition 9b. See also Locke’s definition of judgment in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (156). with sympathy, an affection that attempts to establish likeness.See OED, “sympathy,” definitions 1 and 2.  Blake recognizes an association between measurement and judgment,  aligning Urizen’s embodiment with a critique of the sympathetic  discourse. Consequently, he sees Urizen’s fall into materiality and  Los’s fall into sympathy as incidents that create division as opposed to  unity. In this case, the senses divide, or become separated from the  external world. Therefore, Los’s sympathy, his attempt to create  likeness, divides Urizen from his surroundings, forcing him to perceive  the world through difference (judgment) as opposed to unity, and thereby  inhibiting his true ability to see clearly. Judgment and measurement  for Blake thus become inadequate methods of perception that are linked  more to our faculties of “reason” than to our sensory organs.
 
In separating him from the external world, Urizen’s embodiment thus “narrow[s]” his “perceptions”: 

All the myriads of Eternity: All the wisdom and joy of life: Roll like a sea around him, Except what his little orbs Of sight by degrees unfold. (13.28-32)
 Again, Blake describes Urizen’s eyes as little sensory windows into the  world from which he is isolated, confined, and bounded by his corporeal  prison. In a world dictated and created by sympathy, sight still remains  necessary, particularly as a faculty that triggers sympathetic  reactions. Urizen’s “narrow[ed] perceptions” also invoke a Humean  conception of perception, divided into impressions and ideas. If  Urizen’s eyes are the only part of him that can “by degrees” allow him  to perceive (or sensually experience) the world, then he must rely on  his faculties of thought, on his “ideas” (which mimic his few past  impressions) in order to relate to the world that he has been divided  from. Thus Urizen’s sight, his vision of the world, depends upon a new  kind of reason that restricts and narrows sensual perception and  experience. 
Urizen’s embodiment, therefore, results from an act of sympathy and  in turn makes him susceptible to sympathetic perception. The laws of  sympathy thereby produce an inescapable cycle of sympathetic relations  as Urizen’s fall into materiality breeds further actions and reactions  of pity. For example, once Los abandons his labors, he becomes bound to  Urizen as a result of his sympathetic desire for unity: “The Eternal  Prophet and Urizen clos’d” (13.40). This state of bondage can be read  as a direct result of the psychological process of sympathy. Falling  prey to an endless cycle of mimetic reproduction, Los creates Urizen in  his likeness (a result of sympathetic projection) and in turn becomes  united to Urizen in sympathetic bondage. Upon experiencing the  consequences of his sympathetic desires, Los looks back on an undivided  eternity, only to feel the sublime image striking “horror into his soul”  (13.47). Such sublimity, inspiring a desire for unity, thus prompts Los  to further acts of pity and division: 

Los wept, obscur’d with mourning: His bosom earthquak’d with sighs; He saw Urizen deadly black, In his chains bound, and Pity began,  In anguish dividing and dividing (For pity divides the soul). (13.48-53)
 Once again, Blake makes a direct connection between pity and division  when he maintains that “pity divides the soul.” We can read this  division as stemming from self-mimesis and from the eighteenth-century  discourse of sympathy. Pity divides the soul by forcing us to reproduce  our own past sensations in order to create unity where only division and  distinction exist. Thus Los’s persistent desire to create illusory  union prompts him toward self-division and sympathetic bondage (in which  he becomes tied to another by conceiving of that other in his own  image). Here too Blake connects acts of sympathy with lamentation and  mourning, suggesting that sympathy creates only loss, as opposed to real  unity. 
This sense of mourning permeates the allegorical representation of  pity in the creation of Enitharmon. Not surprisingly, this act of  generation and creation once again stems from Los’s sympathetic  impulses. As in the original Genesis myth, the first woman, Los’s female counterpart, emerges from his own body.Enitharmon  can be characterized as an “emanation” of Los, a classification that  becomes important to the role of gender relations in Blake. Note here,  in particular, Alicia Ostriker’s definition of “emanation” in “Desire  Gratified and Ungratified,” where sexual division between the male and  the female becomes a prototype for all forms of self-division (i.e., in  relation to the self, the self and the other, and the self and God), as  Ostriker analyzes Blake’s emanations through the paradigm of the Jungian  anima. Blake thus rereads the creation of Eve from Adam’s rib in  his parallel pairing of Los and Enitharmon as indicative of the  philosophical structure of sympathy. In Blake’s version of the myth, man in pity forms a mimetic double of himself by dividing his own form:Irene  Tayler, in “The Woman Scaly,” equates the division of the sexes with  other examples of division in Blake’s poetry. She proclaims that sensual  enjoyment leads to the movement outward from self-enclosure. Tayler  also examines female “emanations” in Blake’s work, describing women as  derivatives of men, but also as divisions from the male counterpart. My  reading of sympathy in The Book of Urizen largely depends upon  the interplay between the genders in Blake’s works as divisions rather  than unifications (particularly in regard to Los and Enitharmon). 

The globe of life blood trembled, Branching out into roots; Fibrous, writhing upon the winds: Fibres of blood, milk and tears: In pangs, eternity on eternity. At length in tears and cries imbodied, A female form trembling and pale Waves before his deathy face. (18.1-8)
 Again, Blake portrays embodiment as a binding of the senses, which  actively attempt to free themselves by branching outward. Nevertheless,  the nerves and fibers become trapped beneath an embodied shell. Not only  does Blake make a point of emphasizing the importance of nerves and  fibers as sensual organs in terms of their relationship to sympathy and  sensibility, but he also defines Pity, or Enitharmon, as “in tears and cries imbodied.”Enitharmon,  argues Cox, becomes a satire of contemporaneous notions of sympathetic  love, especially as it relates to forms of humanitarian pity. Blake’s  identification of pity with a woman creates a “parody” of the  eighteenth-century belief that women possess “a greater sensibility than  men” (54) (hence the association of nerves, or nervous disorders in the  poem—often attributed to female ailments and tempers—with sympathetic  sensibility). Moreover, Los here might be characterized as the  sentimental lover, or the man of feeling.  Thus pity becomes an expression not of fellow-feeling but rather of lamentation and loss.Nelson  Hilton analyzes the lamentation imagery in Blake, in particular his  evocations of dew and tears, and states that Enitharmon’s false tears in  The Four Zoas indicate a type of weeping indicative of false  mourning. Hilton attributes the falseness of these tears to Blake’s  attack on the self-dramatization of sentimentality, or more specifically  on the eighteenth-century preoccupation with melancholy. Blake sees  this focus on sentiment and melancholia, Hilton argues, as inhibiting  “the true light of the imagination” and a truer, more ideal version of  sympathy (49). Pity embodied appears as a horrific image, a sight  that produces only further sentiments and an endless cycle of sympathy.  Once Enitharmon receives her allegorical name from the Eternals, who  flee from her in terror, Los pities his creation, embracing her. As the  quintessential sympathetic spectator, Los ironically comes to pity Pity  itself: 
All Eternity shudderd at sight Of the first female now separate, Pale as a cloud of snow Waving before the face of Los.  Wonder, awe, fear, astonishment, Petrify the eternal myriads; At the first female form now separate. They call’d her Pity, and fled.  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  But Los saw the Female and pitied. He embrac’d her, she wept, she refus’d; In perverse and cruel delight She fled from his arms, yet he followd.  Eternity shudder’d when they saw Man begetting his likeness On his own divided image. (18.9-15, 19.1; 19.10-16)
 Notably, it is the vision of Enitharmon that both defines her  as, and gives rise to, pity. Once again, Blake connects sympathy with  sight. Enitharmon’s allegorical naming mirrors the initial act of naming  in the poem with the figure of Urizen. The Eternals, who are revealed  as the namers of Urizen, are likewise the namers of Enitharmon. In the  case of Urizen before his fall, his original naming reveals his  essential nature. Likewise, Enitharmon’s essential nature, as she who  stems from and inspires pity, is reflected by her eternal name. 
Enitharmon’s petrifying image both hinges upon  the association between sympathy and sight and recalls the image of Sin  in Milton’s Paradise Lost.A number of critics have drawn parallels between Blake’s Urizen and Milton’s Paradise Lost. Susan Matthews, in Blake, Sexuality, and Bourgeois Politeness,  connects stories of rape in Blake’s work to incest (ch. 3, 56-81),  considering the relationship among Satan, Sin, and Death in Paradise Lost  (although she does not directly make a connection here to Urizen) (79-80). See also Worrall’s analysis of Urizen (43).  Los’s attempt to “beget his likeness / On his own divided image” not  only becomes a sexual allegory for the act of sympathy but also becomes  associated with incest. The incestuous relationship between Milton’s  Satan and Sin signifies a narcissistic form of reproduction, for Sin  spawns from Satan’s own self. In springing from Satan’s head, Sin  emerges as a mimetic double of Satan derived from what could be read as  Satan’s mental faculties, his psychological projections or  reifications.  Thus Blake views the sexual relationship between  Enitharmon and Los as something perverse in its underlying reliance on  self-mimesis as incest. Moreover, the metaphor of incest for their  relationship further highlights the perversity of sympathy itself, since  both Los’s creation of and desire for Enitharmon arise in the poem as  part of a narrative representation of his own pity.
 
Out of Los and Enitharmon’s sexual relations comes the birth of Orc. Once again, we see a parallel to Paradise Lost,  with the implications of further incest when the triangular  relationship among Los, Enitharmon, and Orc comes to mirror that of  Satan, Sin, and Death. Many critics have argued  that the chain that binds Los in plate 21 (illus. 3) represents the  bondage of jealousy, and thus the illustration indicates a secondary  incestuous relationship between Orc and Enitharmon.Cox  reads pl. 21, a kind of family portrait in which Orc clings to his  mother, as suggestive of incest (155). Notably, he argues, Orc hangs  upon his mother’s breasts and genitals; thus he reads Los’s chain as a  chain of jealousy.

 Moreover, Orc’s birth parallels both the horrific womb imagery of  Urizen’s embodiment and that of Sin, whose snake-like entrails become  food for her own progeny. Orc as the child of Pity undergoes a birth  similar to his mother’s when his image produces a horrific response on  the part of the Eternals, who then name him the “Human shadow.” Again,  Los responds by pitying his child and by bathing him in “springs of  sorrow,” an image of pity as a perverse baptism into a corrupt world  centered upon sympathetic relations, as Orc grows “fed with milk of  Enitharmon [Pity]” (20.7). 
Moreover, Orc’s eternal name recalls his association with Urizen, the  original “shadow” in the poem. The persistent image of the shadow in The Book of Urizen  serves as a symbol of imitation for which the object of sympathy acts  as a mimesis of the sympathizer’s self. Furthermore, the human shadow  becomes connected to images of lamentation and wandering in Urizen when it foreshadows Urizen’s pilgrimage of sympathetic wandering that concludes the poem. As  Urizen is incorporated into a world of his own imaginative making, he  thus becomes bound down to the human world and separate from Eternity in  falling prey to the sights and seductions of sympathetic bondage.Cox  likens Urizen’s pity to that of Los in that they both highlight a  certain inefficacy of pity: “pity fails to redeem situations which are  regarded as pitiable” (157). In part this has to do, as I have stated  above, with pity’s reliance on narcissism and mimesis. Hence, his  exile transforms into a sympathetic pilgrimage in which he laments  creation at the expense of individual and sensual freedom: 

Cold he wander’d on high, over their cities  In weeping and pain and woe!  And where-ever he wanderd in sorrows  Upon the aged heavens  A cold shadow follow’d behind him  Like a spider’s web, moist, cold, and dim, Drawing out from his sorrowing soul The dungeon-like heaven, dividing  Where ever the footsteps of Urizen  Walk’d over the cities in sorrow.   Till a Web dark and cold, throughout all  The tormented element, stretch’d  From the sorrows of Urizen’s soul.  And the Web is a Female in embrio.  None could break the Web, no wings of fire,   So twisted the cords, and so knotted  The meshes: twisted like to the human brain.   And all calld it, The Net of Religion. (25.5-22)
 Here the image of the wanderer, as in the typical romantic prototype, connotes mourning and lamentation.Hilton discusses acts of wandering as characteristic of romantic melancholy in his analysis of Visions of the Daughters of Albion. Lamentation, “almost by definition,” he suggests, is a state of purposelessness that leads to wandering (29). We can, of course, read Urizen’s inclination to wander as psychological as well as literal. Thus his exile serves as an attempt to repair his self-loss according to a Freudian conception of mourning.Hilton  relates Blakean lamentation to Freud’s “Mourning and Melancholia”: “the  melancholic mourns narcissistically for him or herself, for the passing  of some earlier fixation is seen as a death or loss of the precious  self: the intellectualized version of this self-indulgence hides itself  as ‘contemplation,’ and thought becomes the precipitation of mourning”  (50). The “cold shadow” points to a double of Urizen’s self, his  lost essence. Returning to a Humean model of sympathy and subjectivity,  we might read the shadow as an outward projection of Urizen’s identity,  which both doubles and divides him through sympathetic sentiment.  Urizen’s pity, the cold shadow that divides his soul, becomes an  infectious web that branches out like sympathetic fibers in an attempt  to unite affectively to the objects of Urizen’s perception, an attempt  that of course results only in further division, for the “dungeon-like  heaven” is divided. Blake, therefore, figures Urizen’s shadow of  sympathy as an identificatory loss that breeds further acts of mourning  and lamentation, for it jeopardizes the selfhood of both Urizen (as  sympathizer) and the objects of his pity. The hopeful icon of sympathy,  the “heaven” in this new world of materiality, resembles more a  “dungeon” than an Edenic paradise. Moreover, Blake highlights the  mimetic properties of sympathy when he depicts this new world as an  extension of Urizen’s “sorrowing soul.” The web, described as “Female in  embrio,” not only reiterates the notion of materiality and sympathetic  bondage as womb-like (a perverse conception of creation that does not  generate so much as it imprisons), but also points to the woman “Pity,”  Enitharmon’s eternal name, as the seed of this perverse cycle of  sympathetic bondage. Blake likens the “twisted … cords” and knots to  symbols of binding that, like the image of corporeal veins, encircle the  brain, a new-world icon of rationality and “your reason” that replaces  the former one of the formless senses. For Blake, this new world’s  revised conception of reason hinges upon a philosophical and religious  discourse of sensual and sympathetic bondage. Hence, he reveals the true nature of religion by naming Urizen’s cold, shadowy web the “Net of Religion.”Worrall  states that Blake’s “Net of Religion” is a “symbol of feminized  sensibility” and an “effect of [the] ‘shrinking’ senses” (22). For more  on the topic of religion in Urizen, see Worrall’s “Themes and Contexts” section (19-27) and his introduction (9, 11, 12). 
The Book of Urizen closes, both literally and figuratively,  with another image of circularity and womb-like bondage, as “the salt  ocean roll[s] englob’d” (28.23). Blake concludes the poem by reiterating  that in this new world of sympathetic bondage, Urizen’s “net” of pity  stifles and binds the senses, the most important of which is still  sight: 

And their thirty cities divided  In form of a human heart  No more could they rise at will  In the infinite void, but bound down  To earth by their narrowing perceptions,  They lived a period of years  Then left a noisom body  To the jaws of devouring darkness.  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  The remaining sons of Urizen Beheld their brethren shrink together  Beneath the Net of Urizen.  Perswasion was in vain;  For the ears of the inhabitants  Were wither’d and deafen’d and cold.  And their eyes could not discern  Their brethren of other cities. (25.43-47, 28.1-3; 28.11-18)
 Here Blake emphasizes the bleak relationship of vision to a world  dependent upon sympathy. Whenever sight inspires feelings of pity, it  leads only to sympathetic or sensual bondage and thus to blindness.  Humanity in its corporeal form becomes “bound down / To earth by [its]  narrowing perceptions.” Thus the “englob’d” earth resembles the prison  of the human body, and the “narrow perceptions” recall Blake’s former  image of eyes as “little orbs / Of sight” that can perceive only “by  degrees.” Sympathy not only divides, as opposed to uniting, humanity,  but under the guise of “a human heart,” it blinds the human race. 
We attempt to see, unite, and relate to the objects of our pity,  argues Blake, but are bound to an “idea” so remote from our actual  selves that sympathy, by valuing thought over “impression” and by  robbing impression of its immediacy through mimesis, deprives us of  sensual experience and, most importantly, of visionary perception. The  mimetic concept of the imagination that stems from a Smithian or Humean  discourse on sympathy becomes, for Blake, a way of obscuring our sight  so that our “eyes [cannot] discern / [our own] brethren.” Thus sympathy,  the creator and perpetuator of the Urizenic landscape, which  illustrates a world that has fallen into material bondage, divides us  from our surroundings through a mask of unity and fellow-feeling.  Moreover, pity perverts our vision, our ability to perceive and thus  create, for the sympathetic eye is one that mimics without seeing or  creating anew. Thus the freedom of the self, the senses, and the  imagination all fall with the fall of Urizen, giving rise to the tragedy  of a perverse new order that, for Blake, centers around the laws of  sympathy. 
 
The “human heart” that blinds and binds humanity becomes an ironic  symbol of perverse sympathy that also recalls the sensual bondage of the  circulatory system and brain, as seen in Urizen’s embodiment. Hence,  Blake’s dark vision of the Enlightenment emerges from a concept of blindness that links back to Visions. In the world of Urizen, sympathy is an agent of blindness, a corrupt sentiment that narrows our perceptions. Thus  the critique of sympathy in Blake’s anti-Genesis myth emphasizes his  desire to reawaken our sight, to cleanse “the doors of [our] perception”In The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,  Blake describes his method of printing as a way of “illuminating” the  aesthetic object by revealing its inner essence: “The ancient tradition  that the world will be consumed in fire at the end of six thousand years  is true, as I have heard from Hell. … This will come to pass by an  improvement of sensual enjoyment. But first the notion that man has a  body distinct from his soul is to be expunged; this I shall do, by  printing in the infernal method, by corrosives, which in Hell are  salutary and medicinal, melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying  the infinite which was hid. If the doors of perception were cleansed  every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite” (Marriage  14). Hence, Blake’s method of printing becomes a way of cleansing our  eyes, or “doors of perception.” In this manner, it elevates creation  over a mimetic form of reproduction and meanwhile combats blindness  while giving rise to individual and sensual freedom. through a  method of illumination, or illuminated printing, reminding us all the  while of Blake’s cautionary motto that “the Eye sees more than the Heart  knows.”

William Blake considered James Barry a kindred spirit. In his annotations to The Works of Sir Joshua Reynolds, Blake wrote, 

Who will Dare to Say that Polite Art is Encouraged, or Either Wished or Tolerated in a Nation where The Society for the Encouragement of Art. Sufferd Barry to Give them, his Labour for Nothing[.] A Society … Suffering an Artist to Starve while he Supported Really what They under pretence of Encouraging were Endeavouring to Depress.—Barry told me that while he Did that Work—he Lived on Bread and Apples[.] (E 636)
 
Blake was referring to Barry’s The Progress of Human Culture, a project he began for the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce in 1777 and finished seven years later. (Or, perhaps, put aside for a time. Like Blake and his Vision of the Last Judgment, he made alterations on the project for the rest of his life.) His six monumental paintings covering the walls of the Great Room of the Royal Society of Arts commemorated the march of Western civilization from classical times to his day, with the last two paintings concentrating on the leading figures of English art. Blake is right in asserting that the society paid Barry nothing during the years he painted the huge allegorical works, but he does not mention that the society later awarded Barry 250 guineas and a gold medal.
 
During his lifetime, Barry experienced professional success and, more emphatically, a professional decline. Extremely forthright in his opinions, he antagonized anyone who did not share them. Because he shifted ground in his causes and beliefs, it was not easy to stay in his good graces. An Irishman and a Catholic, he hailed, like Blake, the American and French Revolutions as the dawn of a new age, but later found them to be different incarnations of the same tyrannical power. Unlike Blake, however, Barry moved to promote his brand of Catholicism as an apocalyptic cure-all, a version that strips the authority of the pope in all civil matters. A member of the Royal Academy, he lost his position as professor of painting to Fuseli in 1798 after he published his vituperative Letter to the Society of Dilettanti. In his last years he was virtually a recluse, working on his immense canvases and prints in his Castle Street home and studio, a place of mounting squalor and wreckage.
 
In recent years Barry has gained serious attention, with a major exhibition of his works in Cork, Ireland, in 2005, a monograph that year by David G. C. Allan, and extensive discussion of his aims and contributions by Martin Myrone in Bodybuilding: Reforming Masculinities in British Art, 1750–1810 (2005) and Daniel R. Guernsey in The Artist and the State, 1777–1855: The Politics of Universal History in British and French Painting (2007). This growing interest began with the publication of William L. Pressly’s The Life and Art of James Barry in 1981, followed by a major exhibition of Barry’s work at the Tate in 1983 and John Barrell’s numerous references to Barry in his 1986 study, The Political Theory of Painting from Reynolds to Hazlitt. In this volume, Dunne and Pressly have collected fourteen essays from various hands, including Allan, Myrone, Guernsey, and Barrell, addressing a wide range of topics and questions involving Barry’s life and art. If the essays do not speak in one voice, they complement each other to a great extent.
 
Most relevant to students of Blake is David Bindman’s essay, “The Politics of Envy: Blake and Barry.” Bindman argues that both Blake and Barry were victims of the envy of Joshua Reynolds and his cohorts, “who pretended to stand for painting in the Great Style” but actually wanted “to paint flattering and lucrative portraits of those in wealth and power, while the artists who stood for the ideals of high art that could lead society towards virtue were literally starved out” (121). Bindman finds the most powerful expression of this quandary in both artists’ conceptions of the figure of Milton’s Satan, the ultimate envier and hypocrite. “For Barry and Blake,” he writes, “Satan was not an abstraction, but a name for the force that bound together all the moral, political and artistic resistance to man’s true self-realization, made all the more threatening by the attractive face he presented to the world” (124).
 
Bindman exempts Fuseli from the envious academicians. In her essay, “Barry and Fuseli: Milton, Exile and Expulsion,” Asia Haut applies the figure of Satan in quite another way. Pointing out that “dispossession permeates Paradise Lost,” Haut suggests that the great interest both Barry and Fuseli pay to Milton’s epic can be attributed to their “self-exile” from their native countries, Ireland for Barry and Switzerland for Fuseli. “With the theme of Satan, Sin and Death,” Haut argues, “Fuseli, Barry and Milton, in their different and yet similar ways, raise the issue that apparently revolutionary shifts in power might be little more than redistributions of hierarchy, rendering affiliations chaotic” (109).
 
Haut might well have included Blake in this group. But however temperamentally similar the two artists may have been, they had strikingly different approaches to the execution of art. Liam Lenihan notes in his essay, “History Painting and Aesthetics: Barry and the Politics of Friendship,” that “Blake’s most famous criticism of Reynolds and Burke, ‘[t]o Generalise is to be an Idiot’, might surely be applied to Barry, who found perfection in abstract and general nature” (150).
 
Both Barry and Blake believed in the power of art to transform social thought. John Barrell writes in “Reform and Revolution: James Barry’s Writings in the 1790s” that Barry  “was convinced that high art, history painting … was the most effective means  of teaching civic virtues and civil rights, and that the society that is  most favourable for the production of high art will also be the most just society, the society that best safeguards the rights of its  members” (130). Barry’s vociferous republicanism necessarily brought about a rift between him and the prevailing powers.
  
In the most provocative essay of the collection, “James Barry’s ‘Hairbreadth Niceties’: Risk, Reward and the Reform of Culture around 1770,” Martin Myrone refers to J. J. Winckelmann’s assertion in his Reflections on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture that “the line by which Nature divides completeness from superfluity is but a small one …. The Greek artist … adjusted his Contour, in every figure, to the breadth of a single hair.” (Students of Blake might well equate this with Blake’s “bounding line.”) In his letter to his then-patrons Edmund and William Burke, Barry invokes Winckelmann’s distinction when he refers to the “hair-breadth niceties” in his art.
 
Barry, Myrone asserts, steadfastly stuck to his conception of art while artistic taste in Britain vacillated wildly in an unpredictable stock market of fashion. “Barry’s originality,” Myrone writes, “could also be eccentricity; his precision, mere sterility” (39). Barry’s stalwart stance “was not simply self-destructive, deluded or willful; it was a form of position-taking within a game of culture whose rules were in the process of being radically overhauled” (37). Myrone concludes, “Barry’s ‘tragedy’—his tragic alienation from society, from the general taste, his material suffering—may be, rather than an obstruction to or distraction from the realization of his innate ‘greatness’, the necessary and socially predictable precondition for his art” (39). Following Myrone’s line of thought, Barry’s subsequent expulsion from the Royal Academy was inevitable.
 
The volume includes eleven color plates and fifty-five black-and-white illustrations. Its scholarship is impressive, its writing stimulating, and its approaches engaging. Blakeans will benefit from these lively discussions of another renegade artist.
 
In his foreword to the collection, Pressly states that Barry “is Britain’s greatest history painter.” The contributors certainly are  intent on advancing Barry’s reputation, if not to that supreme position, at least to a higher level. Others may incline toward the  judgment of Henry Crabb Robinson, who wrote in his diary entry of 30 January 1815 that “excessive pride equally denoted Blake and  Barry.”

Deciphering Blake’s “The Angel that presided o’er my birth”
 
By David W. Ullrich
 
David W. Ullrich (dullrich@bsc.edu)  is professor of literature at Birmingham-Southern College. He divides  his research interests between British romanticism and twentieth-century  American literature. His recent (2012) publications include an article  on F. Scott Fitzgerald’s This Side of Paradise in the F. Scott Fitzgerald Review and a note on Kurt Vonnegut’s use of “oubliette” in Cat’s Cradle in the Explicator. He is also a sculptor, specializing in stainless steel.
 
 
 
With Angels planted in Hawthorn bowers And God himself in the passing hours . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . With my Father hovering upon the wind And my Brother Robert just behind (Letter to Thomas Butts, 22 November 1802)
 
The stimulus for this investigation of manuscript variants in one of Blake’s Notebook poems arises from an unlikely quarter: Kurt Vonnegut’s God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater (1965). Vonnegut’s use of Blake is purposeful. In Slaughterhouse-Five the narrator states (by way of Kilgore Trout) that “William Blake” was “[Eliot] Rosewater’s favorite poet” (99), and in a 1977 interview in the Paris Review Vonnegut specifically notes, “I was thirty-five before I went crazy about Blake.”Vonnegut comments, “I couldn’t play games with my literary ancestors, since I had never studied them systematically. My education was as a chemist at Cornell and then an anthropologist at the University of Chicago. Christ—I was thirty-five before I went crazy about Blake …” (Hayman et al. 72). Vonnegut was born in 1922. “Thirty-five” years later, 1957, Keynes’s Nonesuch edition of Blake’s Complete Writings was published. In Rosewater, Eliot Rosewater, traumatized by his experience in World War II, dedicates his life and extraordinary wealth to a compensatory form of philanthropy for the population of Rosewater, Indiana. Eliot has written his personal manifesto on the step risers leading up to his office to remind himself and his clients of his life’s purpose and personal vision. His manifesto is identified in Vonnegut’s text only as “a poem by William Blake” (65).Eliot’s father offers a rebuttal to his son’s manifesto by quoting “another poem by Blake” (65), stanza 3 of “The Clod and the Pebble.” The poem is traditionally referred to by its first line, “The Angel that presided o’er my birth,” as rendered in Keynes’s Nonesuch edition, almost certainly Vonnegut’s source. Sacrificing Blake’s rhyme scheme, Vonnegut separates the three-line poem into twelve sections, one for each riser: 

The Angel that presided o’er my birth said, “Little creature, form’d of Joy and Mirth, Go love without the help of any Thing on Earth.”
 Restored to its original stanzaic form, Blake’s poem, a triplet in fairly regular iambic meter and monosyllabic rhymes, reads as follows: 
The Angel that presided o’er my birth Said, “Little creature, form’d of Joy and Mirth, “Go love without the help of any Thing on Earth.” (Keynes, Complete Writings 541)
 
In tracking down “The Angel that presided” in Blake’s canon, I have identified three transcriptions of the poem. Keynes (1957), Erdman (1965, rev. 1988), and Bentley (1978) each record a different transcription of Blake’s revisions.This essay does not address the different editorial policies regarding the punctuation or modernization of Blake’s poem. The variant readings are not trivial; each version significantly alters the poem’s meaning. Moreover, the editors disagree on interpreting Blake’s handwriting in a crucial word.
 
As an orientation point, Erdman’s facsimile edition, The Notebook of William Blake (1977), identifies the poem as “Poem 98,” found on page 32 of Blake’s Notebook (Notebook N32 and N32 transcript). Erdman estimates the date of composition as “after Oct. 1807” but “before PA” (Public Address) or “before May 1809” (Notebook 56). Cross-referencing key words of “The Angel that presided” in A Concordance to the Writings of William Blake indicates that no other version of this poem exists; in other words, Blake never incorporated it into another, larger poem. Illus. 1 reproduces the poem; illus. 2, 3, and 4 reproduce the transcriptions from Keynes, Erdman, and Bentley, complete with their editorial annotations. However, even the reproduction of the original does not provide a definitive answer as to which version is most likely correct, as Blake’s informal handwriting is very difficult to transcribe, especially in inked-over layers.

Substantial differences occur in the concluding line of the poem. Keynes transcribes the last line as “Go love without the help of any Thing on Earth.” In his editorial annotations, he records Blake’s revisions, which, as shown in illus. 2, consist of deleting “thou art formd for Mirth” and replacing it with “formd of Joy and Mirth.”I have omitted Keynes’s apostrophe in “form’d” because it is not present in Blake’s text. However, Keynes makes no comment on Blake’s hypothetical revision of “Thing” to “King,” which both Erdman and Bentley later append (illus. 3 and 4). Moreover, he evidently sees no reason to replace “love” with “live,” as Bentley is compelled to do later (illus. 4).
 
In the facsimile edition, Erdman scrupulously documents any differences between his editorial decisions and Keynes’s previous transcription. Following the general editorial practices outlined in “Explanation of the Transcript” (Notebook [65]), one can infer that, in Erdman’s opinion, Blake wrote “King” over “Thing” in his revision of the poem (illus. 5). 

 
5. David V. Erdman, ed., with the assistance of Donald K. Moore, The Notebook of William Blake: A Photographic and Typographic Facsimile, rev. ed. (N.p.: Readex Books, 1977) N32 transcript.
 
 Erdman notes that “Poem 98” was “begun and revised in grey ink … then further revised and completed in black” (N32 transcript, note). This implies that Blake’s hypothetical revision of “Thing” to “King” was sufficiently persuasive to Erdman’s eye—perhaps even color coded, so to speak—to warrant an alternative reading to Keynes’s transcription. His choice of “King” over “Thing” seems compelling. In fact, Erdman selects “King” in his first (1965) edition of Blake’s work (493), which precedes the Notebook facsimile, and he retains “King” in his revised (1988) edition (see illus. 3). In each edition, he provides the textual note “King]  mended from Thing (but not very clear)” (781, 864). (Bentley’s editorial choice concurs with Erdman’s in this respect.) 
To complicate matters further, other editions of Blake’s work vary in their choice of “Thing” or “King,” even when relying on the same source. For example, Stevenson’s Blake: The Complete Poems (2007), which “tak[es] account of Erdman’s work on the Notebook” (xiii), selects (a modernized, lowercase) “king” while noting “altered probably from Thing” (626). However, Johnson and Grant’s Blake’s Poetry and Designs (2008) chooses “Thing” (385), even as they, too, state that their “selections [from the Notebook] are based on Erdman’s edition, compared with the Erdman-Moore facsimile” (379n).In reference to their selection, Johnson and Grant explain that they “attempt to present each work at an optimum stage of realization by eliminating early drafts and, occasionally, what we consider to be uninspired afterthoughts” (379n). Presumably they suppress “King” because they judge it to be an “uninspired afterthought.” Ostriker’s William Blake: The Complete Poems (1977) uses editorial brackets—“[Thing] King”—to indicate “a  word … emended in the manuscript” (10); hence, she favors “King” (626).
 
Of course, Erdman’s selection of “King” over “Thing” changes the poem dramatically, and these implications will be explored shortly. However, one more editorial issue must be addressed. While Keynes and Erdman both record without comment “Go love,” Bentley substitutes “live” for “love,” also without comment, noting only “[Thing [altered to] King[?] on Earth⎣.⎦” (see illus. 4). Bentley’s question mark after “King” suggests that he, like Erdman, is not completely certain of the alteration. However, by the same logic, his lack of editorial comment with respect to “live” suggests that he is absolutely certain that “live” (not “love”) is the only viable choice, since he does not feel compelled to editorialize. (Stevenson, Johnson and Grant, and Ostriker all select “love” over “live,” probably following Keynes and Erdman.)
 
Bentley’s decision is singular and demands scrutiny. Although I am not an expert in manuscript interpretation or in Blake’s handwriting, I offer a few observations. The choice between “live” and “love” comes down to deciding whether Blake uses an “i” or an “o” (illus. 6).

 There does not appear to be a superscript dot over the vowel, as one would expect with an “i,” which might favor “o” and Keynes’s and Erdman’s “love.” However, Blake’s punctuation is, as one might expect, inconclusive. For example, although a dot appears over the “i” in “birth” and “King/Thing,” there is no dot in “presided,” “Said,” “Little,” “Mirth,” and “without” (see illus. 1). On the other hand, supporting Bentley’s choice of “live,” the vowel does not appear to be a closed loop or even a semi-closed loop, whereas “o” is written in either a completely or mostly closed loop in almost all other words in the poem, including “oer,” “formd,” “of” (written over “for”), “Joy,” “Go,” “of” (again), and “on.” 
The lone exception, “without” (illus. 1), is  potentially crucial for two reasons. First, the descending stroke of the  undotted “i” resembles the cursive shape of the descending stroke of  the vowel in question in “live/love,” supporting Bentley.  Second,  however, the “o” is more open than any other “o” in the poem, supporting  Keynes and Erdman. This may be especially relevant, as the cursive  shape of the “ou” in “without” could approximate the “ov” in “love,”  although the “o” is less open and more fully articulated than the “i/o”  in “live/love.” Moreover, other instances of “without” in the Notebook  vary from the fairly open example in “You dont believe …” (Erdman, Notebook  N21: Poem 143, line 9; E 501)—which resembles the “without” of “The  Angel that presided”—to an unambiguously close-looped “without” in A Vision of the Last Judgment (Erdman, Notebook  N83: 24, line 4; E 560), whose “o” does not resemble the “o” in “The  Angel that presided.” Thus, “without” does not provide conclusive  comparative evidence as to the issue of “live” versus “love.”  In  addition, and trying to be both fair-minded and comprehensive, I note  that of the approximately fifty-seven instances of a decipherable word containing an “o” on page 32 of the Notebook, the vast majority—as many as fifty-three—have a closed or mostly closed “o.”I  say “approximately fifty-seven” instances for the following reasons. Blake crossed out many words on this manuscript page, and  others are illegible; some of these contain the letter “o.” I do not include any of these words; thus, there is some noise in the data. Nevertheless, the  tally does suggest that, at least on p. 32, when Blake writes an “o” he commonly does so in a closed or mostly closed shape.  However, the “o” in “to” from Poem 158 (“These Verses,” line 2: “to Michael Angelo”; E 512) presents an important exception; it resembles the “o” of the word in question in “The Angel that presided” and shares the same “v”- or “u”-shaped quality, although this “o” is not followed by another stroke/letter (illus. 7).The “to” in Poem 99 (“Florentine Ingratitude,” line 1; E 511) and the initial “o” in “fool” (line 3) are open, although less obviously so than the “to” in Poem 158 (“These Verses”).

More broadly, in the eleven instances throughout the Notebook where Blake uses “live,” the specific formation of the letter “i” and the overall cursive shape of the word more closely resemble the letter and word in question in “The Angel that presided” than do the thirty-eight instances of “o” in “love” and the overall cursive shape of the word.My methodology was to generate a list for “live” and “love” from Nelson Hilton’s concordance to Erdman’s Complete Poetry and Prose at the Blake Digital Text Project  and then locate and examine each example in Erdman’s facsimile edition of the Notebook.  There may be some minor discrepancies in the total number generated for each word  (especially for “love”) because of the complexities of the Notebook and my own  imprecision. Nevertheless, one can conclude that “live” is a viable  alternative to “love.” On occasion, unambiguous examples of “live” include the extra ascender/descender that produces the “u” or “v” effect, as in “My Spectre” (Erdman, Notebook N13[3]: Poem 71, stanza 8, line 3; E 475-77) (illus 8).See the following relevant examples of “live” from Erdman’s facsimile: N4(10) and transcript: Msc 6, lines 1 and 2; N22 and transcript: Poem 78, line 40; N111 and transcript: Poem 18, a, line 4.

 Finally, as is the case with the “o”s on page 32, the majority of the thirty-eight instances of “love” contain an “o” that is completely  or mostly closed. Thus, it appears that Bentley’s “live” has as much legitimacy as Keynes’s and Erdman’s “love.” Of course, readers are encouraged to examine the illustrations—as well as the relevant  examples throughout the Notebook—and draw their own conclusions. 
Before I risk any interpretive analysis, some cautionary observations are in order. The poem’s brevity, its seemingly ambiguous placement on the manuscript page with respect to either the central drawing and/or the surrounding poems, even the problem of its genre—all these factors warrant caution rather than hasty speculation.For a discussion of the composition of the page, see Bentley’s footnote “Page 32: Order of Composition” (Writings  2: 942). He notes that “‘The Angel …’ and ‘Sir Joshua …’ [i.e.,  “Florentine Ingratitude”] … were written in the same large hand and  brownish ink respectively above and below the central pencil sketch” and  that “These Verses” was inserted later, “in the last clearly free space above the  design and below ‘The Angel ….’” This pencil sketch is almost exactly the same (in reverse) as the pl. 6 illustration from Visions of the Daughters of Albion.  While the discussion is beyond the scope of this essay, based on the  two mirrored drawings, I suggest that a connection exists between “The  Angel that presided” and Visions in terms of the struggle for  individual self-expression (exemplified in the “Little creature” and  Oothoon) in the face of repressive opposition (as seen in the forces of  “Thing/King,” the rapacious violence of Bromion, and consuming jealousy  of Theotormon). For example, Erdman catalogues the poem under “Satiric Verses and Epigrams,” and “The Angel that presided” certainly seems epigrammatic. But is it satiric? Should it be regarded as one of Blake’s “angry epigrams” (Johnson and Grant 379n)? Finally, Erdman dates the poem between October 1807 and May 1809, which places it years later than its most logical companion poems, Songs of Innocence and of Experience. Can “The Angel that presided” (c. 1807-09) shed light on Songs of Innocence (1789) and Songs of Experience (1794) or provide a context by which to appreciate more fully Blake’s complex relationship with his deceased brother Robert, as suggested below?
 
Blake’s revisions, both those agreed upon and in question, imply an authorial indecision as to the poem’s meaning, most dramatically evidenced in Blake’s interrogation of the original “Thing” and probable decision that “King” is more appropriate. The consequences of his contemplating such a change produce internal reverberations throughout the poem. Hence, the competing drafts reconstruct the evolution of Blake’s decision-making process in articulating to himself the poem’s meaning and record his conflicting assessments as to where to locate the poem within his poetic vision.
 
Specific, non-controversial aspects of Blake’s first draft bear commentary. His only use of “presided” (or its cognate) occurs in this poem (Erdman, Concordance 2: 1474). Literally meaning “to sit before,” “preside” suggests that the angel serves as witness, guardian, and authority (i.e., “president”) (see OED, “preside,” etymology and def. 1). Thus, although Blake begins the poem with the guardian-angel motif, “a familiar image in eighteenth-century hymns” that he satirizes in the Songs (Lincoln 186), he is probably not being satirical in this instance. In addition, the “Little creature” of the original draft resists an explicitly anthropomorphic interpretation and could equally refer to the two-day-old infant of “Infant Joy” or to the “Little Lamb.” The undifferentiated “any Thing on Earth” also supports a more generalized interpretation of “Little creature.” These factors suggest that Blake had in mind the more nascent and integrated state of innocence when initially composing the poem.
 
To focus now on revisions that editors have not questioned, Blake’s  replacement of “thou art formd for Mirth” with “formd of Joy and Mirth” signals a shift in thinking away from defining and limiting the little creature’s purpose in life in favor of elaborating upon its genesis, which logically refers back to  its “birth.” Blake’s first revision, read metaphorically, identifies the  little creature’s parents—its two ontological essences—as “Joy” and “Mirth.” Born of such a lineage, the creature should, naturally as it were, “Go love/live” and not need (or actively resist) the “help” of “any Thing on Earth,” since a higher authority has already been established at its birth. These initial  revisions suggest that Blake originally conceived of “The Angel that presided” as a rather static descriptive sketch representing a “Little creature” in a  state of innocence, but subsequently revised the poem to emphasize the  interconnections among the creature’s symbolic parentage, the moment of its entry into the  world, and its lifelong moral imperative to “Go love/live.”
 
More broadly, the revised poem establishes a binary opposition between “The Angel” and “any Thing on Earth,” the  two forces vying to shape the little creature’s life. In this initially revised  version, however, “any Thing on Earth” risks becoming an empty signifier, abstracted into a limitless  number of possible vague and amorphous referents. As a consequence, “Thing” and  “Earth” almost elide into a single entity, and Earth is portrayed as in conflict  with both the angel and the little creature, and hence is restricted to  relatively sinister connotations. Within this textual fabric, “help” is in danger of losing its ironic force. Thus the  poem breaks down. The little creature cannot fulfill the angel’s mandate to “Go love [live] without the help of any Thing on Earth,” since the poem’s rhetoric unintentionally prohibits the creature’s interaction with the world at large, which the mandate “Go  love/live” requires. For example, Thel’s exploratory dialogues with the Lilly, the Cloud, and the Clod of  Clay run counter to the angel’s caution. Blake’s sensitivity to these  complications may have prompted his further revision of the poem.
 
The hypothetical final revision of “Thing” to “King” (endorsed by Erdman and Bentley) resolves these textual conflicts and provides coherence within the poem’s fabric. No longer an indeterminate “any Thing on Earth,” the revised “King” suggests, even anticipates, that political and, by extension, social constructs of authority and power will challenge the little creature in fulfilling both the angel’s directive and its ethical birthright. Receiving “help” from such sources is now unambiguously and forcefully ironic. In this version, the cautionary nature of the angel’s directive is clear, not confused, as we recognize that the little creature will need to be vigilant in resisting all forms of such “help” in its efforts to fulfill its life’s purpose. Furthermore, Blake’s initial revision distinguishing between “formd for Mirth” and “formd of Joy and Mirth” now becomes crucial and clarifies that the little creature will participate (love/live) in the world in a mutually reciprocal manner. Born of “Joy and Mirth,” it will “Go love/live” and the recipients of its affections will respond in kind. Finally, “King” suggests that Blake now conceives of the little creature as anthropomorphic, but still retaining its universal qualities as an every-child. Now, “Earth” is represented positively, as an environment promoting regenerative love and as a fecund world ready to facilitate the angel’s imperative; it is clearly distinguished from “King” and his social corruptions.
 
“The Angel that presided” juxtaposes “Angel” and “King” in what is, for Blake, a surprisingly adversarial manner. “King” suggests a political reading that takes readers close to the world of “London,” its “blood down Palace walls,” and even Blake’s celebrated caricature of George III in Europe a Prophecy. The orthodoxy, repression, and requisite satire associated with “King” remain, but “Angel” carries none of Blake’s typical associations of conventional religion and pious morality, as satirized in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. Rather, as Hazard Adams suggests, this angel is “a Reprobate angel who reminds the child that all responsibility and power reside in him [i.e., the child]” (436); hence, the angel is purposefully unconventional.
 
Thus, the angel of the final version of the poem comes very close to Blake’s personal and complex understanding of angels, either guardian or guiding, as recorded, for example, in his letters to William Hayley (6 May 1800) and Thomas Butts (22 November 1802) (E 705, 720-23). Blake’s letter to Hayley is especially relevant, as he responds to the death of Hayley’s only son, Thomas Alphonso, and reminisces about the death of his brother Robert in February 1787: “Thirteen years ago. I lost a brother and with his spirit I converse daily and hourly …. I hear his advice and even now write from his Dictate” (E 705). Blake wrote “The Angel that presided” in the notebook that he inherited from his brother and, significantly, he “kept the Notebook near at hand all his life, filling it over the years …” (Erdman, Notebook 1). Hence, the angel does indeed provide a lifelong dictum, if not a literal dictation, by which the little creature is instructed to “Go love/live,” and by which William is inspired to write (and draw). Thus, Blake fulfills the angel’s directive within (and beyond) the memorialized space of the Notebook. Such speculation has legitimacy, since “William thought of Robert as a fellow spirit and even as a spiritual guide” (Bentley, Stranger 6) and as an “‘affectionate companion’ who shared his interests and enthusiasms” (Ackroyd 84). It would be too reductive a critical interpretation—and one antithetical to Blake’s synthetic imagination—to suggest that the angel represents the guiding voice of Robert exclusively directing William, the little creature. Rather, the angel and the little creature enjoy a symbiotic and inspirational relationship within Blake’s imaginary landscape. They can be considered “fellow spirit[s]” or “reciprocal” images of each other, similar to the “mirror” images that Blake produces in Milton (1804-c. 1811) of “William” and “Robert” receiving “inspiration” from Milton (Bentley, Stranger 6, 98),See Milton a Poem pls. 29 (“William”) and 33 (“Robert”) (objects 31 and 36 in copy C in the William Blake Archive). or the “profiles of William and Robert Blake” that are “jestingly and competitively drawn” and appear “in the last page of An Island in the Moon (1784)” (Erdman, Notebook 9).
 
Further support for this hypothesis can be found in Hayley’s October  1801 poem, identified as “William Hayley to the Spirit of His Son” (“My  Angel Artist in the skies”) (Keynes, Letters 36).  The first  stanza serves as an instructive gloss to both “The Angel that presided”  and Blake’s continued belief that his dead brother Robert served as an  inspirational guide for his artistic productions. (The stanza could  easily apply to the sometimes “eccentric” Blake and Robert’s  “inspir[ing]” and “controul[ing]” influence.) 

My Angel Artist in the skies, Thou mayst inspirit and controul a Failing Brother’s Hand and Eyes Or temper his eccentric Soul.
 Blake was probably acquainted with this poem, given the close  relationship between Blake and Hayley at this time. The second stanza  specifically links Blake’s artistic productions to Hayley’s own dead  son: 
Now to the feeling Blake attend, His Copies of dear Cowper view And make his Portraits of our Friend Perfect in Truth as Thou art true.
 
These biographical, textual, and material contexts shed light on the revisions of “The Angel that presided” from its original, more sentimental version to its final, more political version. Moreover, the editorial choice between “love” and “live” accentuates these differences and becomes the deciding factor, tipping the scale in favor of either a sentimental or political interpretation. 
 
For example, “Go love” draws attention to the trace elements of biography in “The Angel that presided.” Thus, while the angel’s imperative “Go love” presupposes the shared communitarian values and holistic relationships found in the idyllic world of Innocence, these values themselves are based upon the kind of close-knit, non-eroticized love exemplified by “favourite” brothers (Bentley, Stranger 6) and upon the symbiotic and highly integrated relationship of a literal brotherly love. “Go love” also emphasizes serving “the other” and not empowering “the self.” Brotherly love, either real or idealized, provides a rationale for restraining, or domesticating, the fiercely independent vision and exacting moral code commonly associated with Blake’s character and writings, since “Man liveth not by Self alone but in his brothers face” (The Four Zoas p. 133, line 25; E 402). Limiting one’s will to power out of respect or compassion for another must inevitably occur for one to participate, imaginatively, in the prelapsarian world of the little creature or in the landscape of Innocence. From another perspective, “Go love” stresses that the nurturing, even regenerative responsibilities implied in the angel’s charge are born of the little creature’s symbolic parents, “Joy and Mirth,” and not imposed by “any King,” which certainly squares well with Blake’s dissenter upbringing (Bentley, Stranger 7; Ackroyd 17, 18). “Go love” also suggests that the “help” offered by “any King” be understood more as an interpersonal betrayal by the civic father-figure than as a political offense against the corporate body politic. In this version, the celestial angel may have difficulty moving beyond merely presiding over the little creature’s moment of birth as it moves into the world to fulfill the angel’s mandate, and the baptismal-like power of “Go love” may diminish as the creature develops into adulthood.
 
On the other hand, the  imperative “Go live” compels the little creature into the experiential world of action, consequence, and personal development, and away from the secure, but ultimately static, worlds of innocence and brotherly love. For Blake, the directive “Go live” implies an unwavering commitment to one’s personal vision and acting accordingly, regardless of the consequences. Under such conditions, “Go live” inevitably conflicts with either the initial “any Thing” or the revised “any King.” In the first version, “any Thing” may refer, obliquely, to the kind of well-intended, if misguided, physical punishment that Blake experienced as a child (as a little creature) when he confided to his “affectionate” and “sympathetic” but “concerned” parents about his recurring visions of angels (Bentley, Stranger 3, 5, 19-21). These “thrashing[s]” appear to have been infrequent, although one source notes that “his father … severely whipped him several times” on account of his visions (Samuel Palmer, quoted in Bentley, Blake Records 10). Whatever their duration or intensity, for Blake they “became a source of perpetual discontent” (Ackroyd 21). Blake may have felt uncomfortable expressing these ambivalences directly in a poem that champions a “reprobate” angel and his directive, and therefore used the generic “Thing” to oppose the visionary angel, only to revise (and suppress) “Thing” for “King” later. Thus, he transforms a painful reminiscence linking his honest accounts of his visions of angels with a rare instance of parental censorship into a metaphoric, public statement about “any King.” Under these pressures, “any King” broadens to include any repressive governing, legislative, or moral authority—any oppressor, kingly or otherwise.
 
The political implications of “Go live” and “any King” are clarified by reference to Blake’s similar phrase, “So spoke an Angel at my birth,” from the unfinished Notebook poem “Now Art has lost its mental Charms” (Erdman, Notebook N79; E 479). “Now Art has lost” creates a decidedly real-world context in which the angel fears that “France shall subdue the World in Arms.” This angel’s mandate compels the persona (who, in “Descend[ing] … upon Earth,” presumably matures into an adult) to “Renew the Arts on Britains Shore” so that “works of Art” will “meet” (that is, conquer) “Armies” and “War.” Significantly, however, and with a typical Blakean twist, if “thy Nation” (i.e., Britain) refuses the “Arts,” then “France shall the arts of Peace restore” and “save thee from the Ungrateful shore” of Britain. Thus, artistic production transcends political allegiances, national boundaries, and military might. The similarity of the two phrases creates a symbolic, perhaps even evolutionary, relationship between the little creature and his angel’s mandate to “Go live without the help of any King on Earth” and the unnamed adult figure in “Now Art has lost,” who fulfills the implied trajectory of the first angel’s directive to “Go live” by realizing the second angel’s imperative to “Descend … upon Earth” and become an artist opposing political strife, war, and “any King” through artistic production.
 
Finally, “The Angel that presided” and “Now Art has lost” stress the importance of the explicit audience’s  commitment to realize the angel’s otherworldly directive through the real-world action of  embracing one’s independent vision and corresponding call to artistic production. Within  the specific context of vision and vocation, Blake’s letter to Hayley suggests that his memory of  Robert and Robert’s “Dictate” continually guide him in his past and future  artistic creations. In fact, Robert continues to inform Blake’s artistic consciousness as late as the 1811 and 1818 printings of Milton.  Thus, “The Angel that presided” can perhaps best be understood as a timeless metatextual promise that Blake makes to himself through  the reciprocal, mirrored image of a guiding angel-brother and his “Dictate.”  In this context, the angel’s spoken imperative to “Go love/live” serves  not only as an example of Blake’s commitment to memorialize Robert, but also as a self-confirming validation of his  previous creative work and his dedication to a personal vision. Importantly, the  angel’s directive also functions as Blake’s pledge to remain vigilant in  fulfilling these promises through future artistic efforts and in spite of the intrusions  of kingly authorities, thus placing Blake in much the same position as the little creature.
 
In conclusion, “The Angel that presided” illustrates in a succinct, and therefore manageable, way the difficult issues confronting editors in transcribing Blake’s manuscripts  and in making informed, but sometimes conflicting, decisions. These  decisions, in turn, define and shape the interpretive possibilities open to a given text, as demonstrated in the alternative  readings produced by “Thing” versus “King” and especially “love” and “live.”  Within this more interpretive perspective, “The Angel that presided” serves as a concise personal manifesto for  Blake, providing him with a lifelong directive to “Go love/live” by opposing  “any King” through artistic production; it also attests to the importance of  guiding angels and their spoken “Dictate” in Blake’s imaginative landscape.  Moreover, the poem highlights the importance of the Notebook as a talismanic metonym for Robert and as a memorialized space providing continual inspiration for Blake’s various  creative experiments. The poem illustrates how his artistic creations can be understood as ongoing collaborations between “fellow spirit[s]” with, at times, William transcribing, as it  were, Robert’s guiding “Dictate,” almost literalizing Blake’s claim that “even in this  world by it I am the companion of Angels” (letter to Hayley, 6 May 1800; E 705).  The nuances implied in “The Angel that presided o’er my birth” extend  our knowledge of Blake’s complex, idiosyncratic, and visionary understanding of angels and their influence on his imaginative world.  Finally, it is a testament to the power of this short poem that, so many years later, it helped inspire Vonnegut  to transform his own personal tragedy and loss into a lifelong credo opposing “any  Thing” (or “any King”) through artistic production—a vision that is both profoundly sacred and  profoundly secular.

Blake in Our Time is a magnificent tribute to G. E. Bentley,  Jr.—one of the titans in Blake studies of the last, as well as current,  century—whose work has “shifted the focus of Blake criticism from  formalism and symbolism to the ‘Minute Particulars’ of Blake’s life and  work,” with Bentley thus launching what is here described as “now the  most productive field of inquiry in Blake studies” ([3]).  Were the  title not already in service, this anthology might better be called Blake in His Time  inasmuch as its core chapters fix attention on Blake’s friends,  patrons, and fellow artists: Stephen and Harriet Mathew, John Flaxman,  William Hayley, Thomas Butts, George Cumberland, and George  Richmond.  On the other hand, the title as we have it drives the  idea that a principal activity of Blake studies in our time is the re-situation  of the poet in his own time and, with that, the rehabilitation of text  and context.  Even more, the title underscores the paradox that the  preoccupation of Blake studies in our time is with Blake in his own  time; that only after we return Blake to his original cultural context  does he emerge as a poet speaking powerfully to our own age from a  frontier of religious speculation and through an ideology that has  survived its own apparent demise.  Among the many outstanding  essays in this volume, those by Robert N. Essick, Mary Lynn Johnson,  Martin Butlin, and Morton D. Paley are especially illuminating, while  the coda, by Jerome McGann, holds its own bright light in Bentley’s  sunshine.
 
No one has made the case more compellingly (nor more dramatically)  than Essick for “the importance of preserving each original copy of  Blake’s writings” ([19]). By Essick’s account, believing that it had six  duplicate prints from There is No Natural Religion, the  Pierpont Morgan Library, deciding to hold on to several of the  originals, sold off its duplicates. It was the luck of the buyers (one  of whom was Essick) that the duplicates were all originals, and the  Morgan’s embarrassment that what it held on to were all  facsimiles.  This “gotcha” moment is a reminder that, among  bibliophiles,  there has been a “mutual interchange” (28) between  collecting and scholarship in which, in the instance of the celebrated  and the celebrant, Bentley no less than Essick, the savvy of the  collector combines with a heightened critical intelligence to produce  scholarship of the first magnitude.
 
Among the other essays, three are of signal importance.  In her  assiduous sorting through of online archives entitled “More on Blake’s  (and Bentley’s) ‘White Collar Maecenas’:  Thomas Butts, His Wife’s  Family of Artisans, and the Methodist Withams of St. Bartholomew the  Great,” Mary Lynn Johnson takes as her subject Thomas Butts, about whom  relatively little is known and some of what is known is manifestly  untrue—for example, Butts’s religious views, as well as his “take” on  the Bible.  The rich yield of this essay is a finely  particularized, well-shaded portrait and “an enriched contextual  understanding of Blake’s friend, patron, and principal collector”  (133).  In the renewed attention that Martin Butlin gives to the  “Ancients”—those young artists who eventually gathered around Blake,  including Samuel Palmer, Edward Calvert, John Linnell, and George  Richmond—especially “the close interaction between these artists”  (204), this eminent art historian crafts a credible argument for  Richmond as Blake’s chief heir, even as he notes intriguingly that, with  one possible exception, Richmond avoids repeating biblical  subjects painted by Blake, yet also produces work that is both “a  distillation of late Blake” and indebted to his “visionary inspiration”  (208).
 
Morton Paley’s “William Blake and Chichester” is the most interesting  and important essay in this collection.  Arguing that “it is time  to reconsider the role of Chichester in Blake’s life, both material and  imaginative” ([215]), Paley illuminates a series of relationships (each  of them owing something to William Hayley) with Joseph Seagrave, John  Marsh, Richard Dally, and John Weller, as well as more tenuous  relationships with John Peachey, William Brereton, and John Quantock,  all of whom “appear in Jerusalem among the Giant Sons of  Albion” (218).  More strikingly, Paley recaptures and credits  Thomas Wright’s earlier apprehension that “the original model for  Blake’s city of the imagination, Golgonooza …, the foundations of his  four-gated city lay in Chichester,” especially its structures of the  marketplace, the cathedral, and the guildhall (219).  “What Blake  saw in Chichester,” Paley concludes, “became part of the major  transition in [his] aesthetics …, of which the ogee arch and the idea of  the Gothic constituted important parts, along with the architectonics  of Golgonooza” (227).
 
If these four essays are mountain peaks in Blake in Our Time,  while others from their hilltops transmit repeated flashes of insight,  the collection as a whole reinforces Bentley’s literalistic, yet always  eloquent, documentation of the Miltonic thundering that the poet is  himself a true poem: “His life is more than an illumination of his own poetry …. It bears the shape of great art itself.”G. E. Bentley, Jr., speaking of Blake, in The Stranger from Paradise: A Biography of William Blake (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001) xxvi.   To the extent that these essays replicate Bentley’s own move from  interpretation in his early years to the historical particularity of his  later works, they should not be misconstrued as necessarily signaling a  move beyond interpretation.  Rather, they participate in a  historicism into which interpretation is enfolded.  Indeed, some  would seem to signal a next move for Blake studies in the attention they  (at times) give to Blake’s own writings on art (Joyce H. Townsend and  Bronwyn A. Ormsby), to Blake as an archetypal romantic poet (David  Bindman) and defining figure of romanticism, to his (and his age’s)  experimental writings (Keri Davies), to their creation of new forms of  literary illustration (Mark Crosby), to Blake’s visionary imagination  (Butlin), to the uncaging of the human spirit and “drawing aside of the  fleshly curtain” (Butlin, quoting Samuel Palmer, [201]).  These  essays, then, selectively gesture beyond poetry to poetics, indeed  toward Blake as the founder of a new poetics to which Marjorie Perloff  has recently given stunning articulation.  
 
In so many ways a harbinger of things to come, Blake anticipates a  poetics of “unoriginal genius” to which Charles Bernstein, in Perloff’s  account, gives more recent definition: “I love originality so much I keep copying it.”Marjorie Perloff (quoting Bernstein) in Unoriginal Genius: Poetry by Other Means in the New Century (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2010) 1.  Long before, Blake avers: “The  difference between a bad Artist and a Good One Is the Bad Artist  Seems to Copy a Great Deal: The Good one Really Does Copy a Great Deal.”Blake, “Annotations to The Works of Sir Joshua Reynolds,” The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, newly rev. ed., ed. David V. Erdman (New York: Anchor–Random House, 1988) 645.  Blake then produces a poetry in which the thick clusterings of allusion  collage into sequences and collide within contexts that, here invoked  by picture and there by word, are themselves zones of contention.  Continually interacting with those (often shifting) contexts and in the  process often modifying them, Blake’s poetry, written at the borders of  coherence and constantly testing its limits, time and again shatters  into fragments and, defeating expectations, creates cognitive  dissonance.  In the process, Blake’s poems, interacting not only  with external contexts but with one another, witness the transformation  of their own content and the modification of their own myths. As their  altering eye beholds the dissolution of usual structures of perception,  the poet, gaining perspective on his own cultural moment, mounts a  critique of it.  It would be a mistake, however, to infer from the  aforementioned essays that Blake studies, pendulum-like, has swerved  from interpretation to history, from criticism to biography.   Rather, Blake studies has taken the form of an ascending spiral, with G.  E. Bentley, Jr., overseeing one rotation and thus leaving an important  phase signed with his honor.  It is in his  “art”—“it is in the glories of sight and sound, in the divine vision  preserved in time of trouble,” says Bentley, “that Blake lives for us  most truly.”Bentley, The Stranger from Paradise xxv, xxvi.

Blake and Stedman as Costumiers: Curious Copies of Blake’s Engravings in 1821
 
By G. E. Bentley, Jr.
 
G. E. Bentley, Jr. (gbentley@chass.utoronto.ca) has been publishing about William Blake and his circle since 1954. His William Blake in the Desolate Market (McGill-Queen’s University Press) is in the final stages of proof.
 
 
 
the With thanks to Robert Brandeis, scholar, librarian, and friend.Costume is correct according to authentic monumentsBlake, Descriptive Catalogue (1809), ¶18, and “Blake’s Chaucer: An Original Engraving” (1810), ¶9 (William Blake’s Writings, ed. G. E. Bentley, Jr. [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978] 2: 834, 866).
 
Blake’s quarto engravings of sensational scenes for his friend John Gabriel Stedman’s Narrative, of a Five Years’ Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam,  2 vols. (1796), were perhaps more widely seen by his contemporaries  than any others he made.  Not only did the first edition sell very  well—I have traced 138 copies in public collections—but it was reprinted  in the less common edition of 1806 (26 copies) and the rather uncommon  edition of 1813 (11 copies).
 
Though the designer is Stedman, an interesting amateur artist, it  seems likely that some aspects of the engravings are due to the  engravers.  As Robert Essick comments, 

Stedman’s amateur drawing is not without charm, but his  figures lack grace, and his sense of composition (although perhaps  faithful to the scene portrayed) falls below contemporary standards of  proportion and balance.  Thus it seems fair  to believe that the dignified postures and expressiveness of the  features in Blake’s plates were in part the work of the engraver.Robert N. Essick, William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991) 71. A Stedman drawing not engraved for the Narrative is in Gordon N. Ray, The Illustrator and the Book in England from 1790 to 1914 (New York: Pierpont Morgan Library; London: Oxford University Press, 1976) 9.
 In his 1785 diary, Stedman remarked that “my  talents for drawing were so universally admired that my parents were  advised … to Encourage me since I would make a figure by proper  cultivation not inferiour even to Rubens or van Dyk.”John Gabriel Stedman, Narrative …, ed. Richard Price and Sally Price (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988) xliii. An example of the changes made by engravers to his drawings is his sketch of the Manner of Sleeping andc. in the Forest, showing heavy jungle and a fire built under the hammock to keep off mosquitoes; Barlow’s engraving of it in 1791 for the first edition shows open savannah and the fire clearly to one side.Stedman, Narrative …, ed. Price and Price, xliii, xlvi, fig. 7. 
Further, Stedman’s Narrative was repeatedly reprinted abroad, often with prints,According to Bentley, Blake Books  (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977) 624, the Stedman copperplates were  apparently not reused in editions of Halle (1797), Paris (1799), Leiden  (1799), Lausanne (1799), Amsterdam (1800), Stockholm (1800), London  (?1809), Milan (1818), and Boston (1838). as 1.

Blake’s plates for Stedman were also adapted in some surprising contexts. Robert Brandeis noticed this entry in the Swann (New York) catalogue of Printed and Manuscript African-Americana, 21 Feb. 2008, and immediately brought it to my attention: 

ALMOST SURREALISTIC SCENE 77 (SLAVERY AND ABOLITION.) [BLAKE, WILLIAM].  The Skinning of the Aboma Snake shot by Cap. Stedman.   Untitled hand-tinted version of one of William Blake’s engravings for  John Gabriel Stedman’s “Narrative of a Five Year’s Expedition against  the Revolted Negroes of Surinam.”  7 x 9 3/8 inches; small embossed  stamp of Bramati, “costume antico e moderno.” [Milan, 1818] Estimate $400-600 Probably from the Italian edition of Stedman’s “Narrative.”   This version of Blake’s engraving has added to it a smiling black  gentleman who appears to be standing in a poppy field.  According  to Stedman, the snake was 22 feet long.
 Nothing like this plate has been recorded in connection with Blake  before, and there are a number of very puzzling features of the design  reproduced (illus. 1) and of the description of it.

In the first place, the surrealistic scene combines two engravings by  Blake after Stedman’s designs: “The Skinning of the Aboma Snake, Shot  by Cap. Stedman” (illus. 2) and “The Celebrated Graman Quacy” (illus. 3) in Stedman’s Narrative (1796), vol. 1, at p. 174 (18.3 x 13.7 cm.), and vol. 2, at p. 348 (18.5 x 13.4 cm.); the dimensions of the design (17.8 x 24.5 cm.)The  dimensions of the print given in the Swann catalogue (7 x 9 3/8″=17.8 x  24.5 cm.) are for the image only; the platemark is 19.7 x 26.0 cm. (in  the Toronto set). are slightly smaller than the combination of the designs of these two prints would give (18.5 x 27.1 cm.).

 Further, the layout has been altered from portrait (vertical) to  landscape (horizontal), with a number, 59, above the top right corner of  the framing line.  To be bound in a conventional volume, higher  than it is wide, the print would have to be turned sideways. 
In the second place, the print comes not “from the Italian edition of  Stedman’s ‘Narrative’” of Milan, 1818, with small octavo plates, but  from an entirely separate work in folio, as Brandeis brilliantly  discovered. The crucial clue is “Bramati,”There were three Bramati brothers, all engravers: Giuseppe (1795-1871), Antonio (1799-1875), and Luigi (1801-60) (Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, vol. 13 [1971]). Giuseppe is the engraver of the Ferrario plates.  whose name appears below the right corner of the design and in the  embossing.  The surrealistic scene comes from an enormous and  enormously complicated compilation in seventeen folio volumes by  Giulio Ferrario, which was published simultaneously in Italian and  French editions, sometimes mixed together, such as the sets in the  British Library and the Fisher Rare Book Library of the University  of Toronto.  The French version is called Le costume ancien et moderne ou histoire du gouvernement, de la  milice, de la religion, des arts, sciences et usages de tous les peuples  anciens et modernes, d’après les monumens de l’antiquité et accompagné  de dessins analogues au sujet par le docteur Jules Ferrario (Milan: De l'imprimerie de l'éditeur, 1817-26). The Italian version is entitled Il costume antico e moderno, o, storia del governo, della milizia,  della religione, delle arti, scienze ed usanze di tutti i popoli antichi  e moderni provata coi monumenti dell’antichità e rappresentata cogli  analoghi disegni dal dottor Giulio Ferrario.
 
It was originally issued in 143 weekly installments, with over 1500  folio prints sold both plain and colored.  There were later  editions in Florence (26 8º vols., 1823-28), Naples (20 vols., 17 cm.,  1831-42), Livorno (100 12º vols., 1830), and Turin (26 vols., 22 cm.,  1834). Sometimes sets were sold, or at least survive, with only a single  continent or even a single country.  The portions devoted to the  Americas are in vol. 7 (1820), with 87 prints (called America vol. 1),  and vol. 8 (1821), with 80 prints (called America vol. 2, and on the  half-title page Costumes de tous les peuples de l’Amérique seconde partie Amérique méridionale).
 
Elaborate efforts were made by Ferrario to ensure authenticity.   The half-titles are stamped with the signature of “Giulio Ferrario,”  and each print is embossed with a very small circle labeled Bramati,  “costume antico e moderno,” presumably to frustrate forgers and  imitators in the absence of international copyright.  After all,  Bramati was borrowing Stedman’s images without notice.  When  Laurence Sterne wanted to guarantee the authenticity of the authorized  editions of Tristram Shandy, he signed each copy himself.   This was much more time-consuming than stamping and embossing, and it  could not be delegated to a mechanic—but on the other hand, Sterne was  signing only one leaf per volume, whereas the Bramati embossing appears  eighty times in the second volume of Ferrario’s America.
 
The engraving and coloring of the Bramati prints are professionally  skillful.  Most of the scenes are landscape dimensions and printed  sideways. There are at least four plates derived from Blake’s plates in Stedman.The  model for the Ferrario prints cannot be “the Italian edition [1818] of  Stedman’s ‘Narrative,’” as the Swann catalogue suggests, for the  Ferrario prints copy Stedman pls. 7-8, 19, 32, 35, 49, 53, 68, 71, and  76, and of these only pls. 7, 19, 35, 49, 68, and 76 appear in the Milan  1818 edition; pls. 8, 32, 53, and 71 echoed in Ferrario are not in the  Milan edition.  Indeed, most of the information in the  section of Ferrario’s text “de la Guyanne” seems to be derived from  Stedman, “traduction Italienne” (8: 406).  For instance, there is  an account of “le fameux Graman-Quacy” “avec le bel habit et la  médaille d’or dont le Prince d’Orange lui fit présent … avec sa tête  chauve et son habillement écarlate et bleu, galonné en or, tel qu’on le  voit ici à la planche 59” (8: 406).  And the young 22' boa snake,  which was still alive when it was hung up, is described in the text:  “voyez la planche ci dessus” (8: 409). The four Ferrario plates derived  from Blake’s represent Pl. 59 (see illus. 1): “Graman Quacy etc.,” signed “Bramati f.” at bottom right, “Bramati fec” at bottom left; Pl. 62 (see illus. 4): “Planteurs de Surinam,” signed “G. Bramati dis. e inc.” at bottom left, “D. K. Bonatti l’A.T.” at bottom right; Pl. 63 (see illus. 10): “Nègres sous un bon maître,” “G. Bramati dis”, “D. K. Bonatti l’A.T.”; Pl. 65 (see illus. 12): “Chasseurs Négres [sic] affranchis à la poursuite des rebelles,” signed as in pl. 63.
 
The anomaly of the celebrated Graman Quacy calmly gazing at the  viewer rather than watching the sensational scene behind him is  explained by the fact that in the original he was not even in the same  volume as the aboma snake—besides, the important feature in Le costume ancien et moderne  was not officially what they did but what they wore or, in the case of  the slaves and the snake, what they didn’t wear. In fact, however, the  text does not focus exclusively or even very extensively on costume, and  some of the scenes depicted are merely landscapes.  Ferrario might  have appropriately adopted Stedman’s subtitle, Elucidating the  History of That Country, and Describing Its Productions, viz.  Quadrupedes, Birds, Fishes, Reptiles, Trees, Shrubs, Fruits, and  Roots; with an Account of the Indians of Guiana, and Negroes of Guinea  … Illustrated with … Elegant Engravings.
 
There are significant differences between Blake’s engravings of “The Celebrated Graman Quacy” (illus. 3) and “The Skinning of the Aboma Snake” (illus. 2) and Bramati’s print of “Graman Quacy etc.” (illus. 1).   For one thing, Bramati’s hunter, presumably Stedman himself, has picked  up his gun from where he had left it carelessly leaning against the  tree, put shoes on (Stedman customarily went barefoot), and turned  round, so that we can see the powder horn slung across his chest.   He has also slung on his sword, which he may have been holding in his  left hand in Blake’s plate.  The two naked slaves at the foot of  the tree have been joined rather awkwardly by a third heaving on the  snake-line with his back to the tree.  The tree has gained a good  deal of foliage, the little boat and the water on which it floats are  gone, the serpent has lost his spots, and his tongue, so ominously  flickering in Blake’s version, is scarcely visible in Bramati’s.
 
The celebrated Graman Quacy has been altered even more.  His  silver-headed walking stick has been moved from his left hand to his  right, his extravagant hat is tucked under his right arm rather than  flourished in his right hand, his metal shoe buckles are barely visible,  and he is standing stolidly rather than walking with a fearful and  ingratiating expression.  More strikingly, his background has lost  its fortress at the right and the house and tree plantation at the left.  The “poppy field” at which Quacy points in Ferrario (but not in  Stedman) is the Quessia amara, whose therapeutic benefits he  pointed out to Europeans and which was therefore named after him. To  unite the two quite disparate scenes, Bramati has extended Quacy’s  foreground across that of Stedman and his aboma snake.
 
The sensational snake and Blake’s busy background have been  simplified by Bramati to emphasize the costumes, or the lack of  them.  Bramati’s four slaves and the snake appear en déshabillé,  Stedman’s shirt and Quacy’s nether garment and part of his extravagant  hat are dark pink in the Fisher copy, Quacy’s coat is dark blue, the  blossoms are touched with red, and the serpent is pale green. Some  copies of the first edition of Stedman’s Narrative (1796) were  commercially colored, but it seems unlikely that the copy of Stedman  that Bramati copied was colored—or that his colorists cared if it was.
 
Blake, of course, was a professional artist and Stedman was only an  enthusiastic amateur. Stedman’s designs do not survive, but it is  generally assumed that Blake tidied them up and, probably inadvertently,  Europeanized them.  Blake had never seen Surinam or an aboma  snake, and the poses and features of the individuals are likely to have  been classicized, especially in the slaves struggling to hoist up the  snake. Blake and Stedman would doubtless have been as astonished as Bob  Brandeis and I were to see the sensational or naturalistic scenes of  Stedman’s Narrative converted to costume fodder.
 
Graman (Great Man) Quacy was a well-known figure in Surinam who was  crucially helpful to Stedman in tracing the “Revolted Negroes” to their  jungle fastnesses.  Quacy’s right ear was cut off by an Indian  chief who was betrayed by him—and in Stedman’s portrait his right ear is  not visible.  Stedman wrote that Quacy “came to  shew me his fine coat, gold medal, andc. which he had received as a  present from the Prince of Orange, in Holland.”Stedman, Narrative … (London: J. Johnson, 1796) 2: 346.   Presumably the elegant and odd European clothes and medal that Quacy  is wearing are from the Prince of Orange.  In their edition of Stedman,  Richard and Sally Price speculate that the prevalence today of the name  Quacy in Surinam and the West Indies may be due to the notoriety of  Graman Quacy. However, this is probably not the case.  Many years  ago, when our daughter Julia took us to a concert by the extraordinary  West Indian poet and singer Linton Quacy Johnson, I sent him a note  backstage remarking on the speculation of the Prices.  Six months  later he very kindly replied, suggesting that perhaps the Prices were  unaware that in the part of Africa from which his people had come,  “Quacy” means “Sunday,” and that children born on Sunday are likely to be named Quacy.According to Wikipedia (Akan names),  among the Akan people of Ghana and the Ivory Coast, children are  frequently named after days of the week, such as “Kwesi” for Sunday.

 Ferrario pl. 62, “Planteurs de Surinam” (illus. 4), has  a particularly intricate iconographical background.  The woman at  the left is Stedman’s wife/mistress, the fifteen-year-old Joanna,  represented in Stedman pl. 8 (illus. 5), reversed, with new decorations in her hair.  The Stedman print is described merely as “A Female Mulatto”Mulatto, from the Spanish mulato, mule, is an individual with one black and one white parent. in the directions for placing the plates. The woman beside her with a hat is the “Female Quadroon Slave of Surinam,”A quadroon had one black grandparent, and an octoroon is the offspring of a white and a quadroon. engraved by Perry for Stedman pl. 32 (illus 6).  Clearly the Stedman prints were to illustrate in part the distinction  between mulatto and quadroon. In Ferrario her position has been  reversed.

 The almost-nude woman hanging from a tree is adapted from Stedman’s pl. 35, “Flagellation of a Female Samboe Slave,”A sambo was an individual with mixed black, Indian, and white blood.  Later the term became intensely pejorative. engraved by Blake (illus. 7).   In Ferrario her breast is not in profile and the positions of the  whippers have been altered. The slave being beaten may be adapted from  Stedman’s pl. 71, “The Execution of Breaking on the Rack,” not signed  but attributed to Blake (illus. 8).  In Ferrario,  the victim is standing, not prone, and there are two executioners. The  man smoking a pipe and the bare-breasted woman pouring his morning  potation is Stedman’s pl. 49, “A Surinam Planter in His Morning Dress,”  engraved by Blake (illus. 9).  He has been placed  in an arcade that has no precedent in Stedman but may be characteristic  of Milan, where Ferrario’s plate was engraved.

Ferrario pl. 63, “Nègres sous un bon maître” (illus. 10), is copied from Blake’s “Family of Negro Slaves from Loango” (illus. 11),  reversed, with a reclining nude added in the background at left and a  precipitous cliff at right in order to convert the portrait shape to  landscape format.  The woman is more European in Ferrario, her  clothes are the same pattern in Blake but the skirt is blue and the top  white in Ferrario, her pipe has much more smoke, the toddler is between  the adults, and the Ferrario man looks directly at the woman.  The  scene is described in Ferrario 8: 433.  Ferrario says little of bad  slave-masters and does not reproduce Blake’s “A Negro Hung Alive by the  Ribs to a Gallows,” Stedman pl. 11.

 Pl. 65, “Chasseurs Négres [sic] affranchis à la poursuite des rebelles” (illus. 12), adapts Blake’s “A Coromantyn Free Negro, or Ranger, Armed” (illus. 13),  with a bayonet added, plus soldiers coming up the crest of a hill to  the right and omitting the background. The rebarbative individual to the  left is apparently adapted from “A Rebel Negro Armed and on His  Guard” (illus. 14), his head and left arm lowered; the  ax, at his left side in Ferrario, is at his right side in Stedman. The  middle thug is closely related to the one at the left, but the third has  no precedent in Stedman.  The skull and bone are from “A Negro  Hung Alive by the Ribs to a Gallows.” The scene is described in Ferrario  8: 437.  The single ranger is clad in a red bandanna and buff  trousers in the Fisher copy.

Other works of Blake’s time contain reproductions of his Stedman engravings: 1. John Pinkerton, ed., A  General Collection of the Best and Most Interesting Voyages and Travels  in All Parts of the World; Many of Which Are Now First Translated into  English. Digested on a New Plan. By John Pinkerton … Illustrated with  Plates, vol. 14 (London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown,  and Cadell and Davies, 1813); at p. 257 is “The Skinning of the Aboma  Snake”; 2. R. P. Forster, A Collection of the Most Celebrated Voyages and  Travels, from the Discovery of America to the Present Time … Carefully  Selected from Writers of Different Nations (Newcastle upon Tyne:  Printed and published by Mackenzie and Dent, 1816), 8º, 80 parts in 4  vols., with 35 plates including Blake’s “Execution of a Negro in  Surinam” (called “A Negro Hung Alive by the Ribs to a Gallows” in  Stedman) and “The Skinning of the Boa Snake”; 3. Gottlieb Tobias Wilhelm, Unterhaltungen über den Menschen, 3  vols., 196 folding plates (Vienna, 1819), reproduces “A Female Negro  Slave, with a Weight Chained to Her Ancle,” engraved by  Bartolozzi, and the skinning of the aboma snake; 4. Anon., Travels in South America (Dublin: John Jones, 1824), woodcuts of “The Mecoo and Kishee Kishee Monkeys” and “The Skinning of the Aboma Snake.”
 
Blake’s father and brother kept a hosiery and haberdashery shop over  which he was born and where he lived for at least the first fourteen  years of his life, and he would have been familiar with the ambitions  and vagaries of sartorial fashion.  As a professional engraver, he  made prints such as those for Stedman that incidentally represented the  costumes of Australia, England, France, Greece (ancient), the Holy Land,  Italy (Roman and Renaissance), the South Pacific, Spain, and  Surinam.  However, the only explicit fashion plates he made were  the two that represented “The Morning Amusements of Her Royal Highness  the Princess Royal and Her 4 Sisters” and “A Lady in the Full Dress,  and Another in the Most Fashionable Undress Now Worn” for the Ladies New and Polite Pocket Memorandum Book for 1783 (1782).
 
The only other engravings by Blake that are known to have been copied in Blake’s time outside Britain were in Lavater, Aphorisms (Dublin, 1790) and the fourth edition (Boston and Worcester [Massachusetts], 1790), William Hayley, The Life of William Cowper (New York, 1803), copying Blake’s plates in the London edition of that year, and Marie Vollstonecraft, Marie et Caroline (Paris, 1799), copying Blake’s engravings after his own designs for Mary Wollstonecraft’s Original Stories (1791, 1796).

Appendix: New Information on Blake’s Engravings
 
 
  
The       2012 marketplace offered some notable Blake sales and discoveries. In my last report I briefly mentioned a       previously unrecorded impression of pl. 15 from For Children: The Gates of Paradise (Blake 45.4 [spring 2012]: 109, 110). I am now able to provide further information about this       uncommon print; see the first entry under Illuminated Books, below, and illus.       1 and its caption.
 
Copy       Y of Songs of Innocence has had a       difficult life. It was once part       of a (presumably) complete copy hand colored by Blake, but after a fire in the       1890s the salvageable plates were divided into copies R (9 pls., now Keynes Collection, Fitzwilliam Museum) and Y (15       pls.).Neither copy includes the title page (BB pl. 3).  The sequence of pen and ink numbers in copy R/Y indicates that 3 other pls. are missing, probably BB pls. 21, 53, and 54.  Fire damage to copy R (and hence to Y) was first reported in Geoffrey Keynes, A Bibliography of William Blake (New York: Grolier Club, 1921) 101 (copy R identified as copy M).  The 1890s date of the fire is recorded in Keynes, Bibliotheca Bibliographici (London: Trianon P, 1964) 55, no. 508.  Evidence for the fire is provided by one “scorched” leaf in copy R (Bibliotheca  55) and the darkened (probably singed) edges of other leaves in both  copies.  I do not know the basis for Keynes’s dating of the fire. The latter, acquired in 1962 by Walter       Neuerburg, was on deposit at       the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum       in Cologne from 1978 until the early years of this century. The owner, apparently Walter Neuerburg’s heir or heirs, reclaimed the prints in 2004 or       2005 and sold 8 in 6 lots at Sotheby’s New York on 1 November 2007.For information on copy Y, see Detlef W. Dörrbecker, “Innocence Lost and Found: An Untraced Copy Traced,” Blake 15.3 (winter 1981-82): 125-31.  For copy R/Y, see Joseph Viscomi, Blake and the Idea of the Book (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1993) 305-06, 308-09, 311-12, and BBS 119-20.  For a report on the 2007 auction, see Blake 41.4 (spring 2008): 140, 142, 145, 146, and illus. 1-5. In late February 2012, I learned from       John Windle that the same auction house would offer the remaining 7 plates of       copy Y in 6 lots at its 26 April sale. Several characteristics, including different ink colors and the       overwriting of poorly printed letters, indicate that Blake’s creation of Songs of Innocence copy R/Y was a       reclamation project, similar in that respect to Songs of Innocence and of Experience copy E in the Huntington Library. Such copies largely comprise impressions that had originally been put aside       because of weak printing of their texts. Thus, the dates of printing are not necessarily the same as the dates when       the pages were selected, collated, numbered in pen and ink, and probably bound       by Blake’s wife, Catherine. Some       plates may have been colored, in whole or in part, shortly after printing; many       plates were colored, or at least had their coloring augmented and many letters       overwritten, when they were gathered into copies. Blake evidently assembled prints from several press runs in       four ink colors—light brown, dark reddish brown, blue, gray-black—to create       copy R/Y in about 1811. He strengthened       poorly printed letters by hand, added a few gold highlights, and probably       touched up the coloring of some of the designs. “Laughing Song,” however, stands out from the group because       of its very different watercolor palette in the design. It was probably printed and hand tinted       at an earlier date than its companions.
 
The       auctioneer’s estimates for the plates of copy Y sold in 2007 were tantalizingly       low, but the extraordinary prices they fetched—the result of two crazed Blake       enthusiasts bidding against each other—prompted Sotheby’s to publish much       higher estimates for the 2012 auction. “The Little Boy Lost,” however, was given an estimate lower than its       companions because of the questionable authorship of the opaque white pigment       applied to the text area—see the caption to illus. 7 for details. I did not attend the auction, but       watched it live on Sotheby’s webcam. Prices were strong, with only one lot selling for a hammer price (the winning       bid, exclusive of the buyer’s premium) below the estimate range, two lots       selling within their ranges, and three lots attracting bids above their high       estimates. John Windle, who       attended the auction, purchased three lots for two clients. See the entry below under Illuminated       Books and illus. 2-8 for further information.
 
Arthur Vershbow of Newton Centre, Massachusetts, died on 16       April 2012. His collection       included posthumous copy p of Songs of       Innocence and of Experience and two drawings by Blake, The Waking of Leonora, Design for the Tailpiece of Bürger’s       “Leonora” (Butlin #338), and Colinet and Thenot, with Shepherds’ Crooks, Leaning against Trees (Butlin # 769.3), one of the preliminary drawings for Blake’s Virgil wood       engravings. In October I learned       that the Vershbow collection will       go to auction at one of the major New York houses in April 2013.
 
Maurice       Sendak died on 8 May 2012. Renowned for his children’s books and illustrations, Sendak was also a       major collector of Blake. I do not       know the full extent of his holdings, but record below important works       owned by Sendak that I have listed in earlier sales reviews:

Hand colored by Blake and/or         his wife, Catherine. Virgil, Pastorals, 1821. Blake’s wood engraving, cuts 2-5, 1st proof st. before the individual designs were separated into 4 blocks and trimmed         on their margins.
 
 Sendak     had a close relationship with the Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphia,     but as of January 2013 that institution is not in a position to confirm that     his Blakes will be coming to them. 
Grosvenor       Prints, London, continues to turn up Blake rarities, although sometimes they do       not know exactly what they have. In May I found on their web site a pre-publication proof of Blake’s       “Death’s Door” engraved by Schiavonetti—see the entry under Blair, The Grave, under Letterpress Books with Engravings by and after Blake, below.
 
In       my 2011 sales review I briefly noted the discovery of several pictorial works       by Blake: a watercolor with a verso drawing, a recto/verso pencil sketch, and a       pen and ink drawing possibly by Blake, all in an album owned by a descendant of       Charles Augustus Tulk—see Blake 45.4       (spring 2012): 109. The executors       of the estate of James Richard Ley, who had inherited the album many years ago,       considered giving it to the Tate in       lieu of taxes. Their proposal was rejected by H. M. Revenue and Customs for       technical reasons, and the executors sold the album in spring 2012 to the       London dealer Lowell Libson.In an  e-mail to John Windle, 7 June 2012, Libson stated that he had acquired  the entire album. He has not answered my inquiries about the album. One work by Blake emerged onto the       market by June and another in October—see Harpers       and Other Drawings (a nonce title of my own devising) and Parental Affection (Libson’s title) under Drawings and Paintings, below, and illus. 9-12, 14. The verso of Harpers,       bearing sketches for America and Europe (illus. 10-11), offers       fascinating information about how Blake developed images for his illuminated       books. I have not been able to acquire       a high-resolution image, sufficient for reproduction in this journal, of Bearded Man and a Youth, my provisional       title for the pen and ink drawing perhaps by Blake.
 
The       Fine Art Society of London held a selling exhibition entitled “Samuel Palmer       [and] His Friends and His Followers,” 30 May to 22 June. The handsome catalogue includes most of       Palmer’s prints and also works by George Richmond and Welby Sherman. These are all listed under their       respective artists in the section on Blake’s Circle and Followers, below.
 
The       distinguished London art dealer Andrew Wyld died on       14 November 2011, aged only 62. Christie’s London auctioned most of his       remaining stock on 10 July 2012. Wyld had sold his one Blake drawing to the Metropolitan       Museum of Art shortly before his death,See The Resurrection or The Last Trumpet, Blake 45.4  (spring 2012): 110.  For illus. of recto and verso and comments, see  Martin Butlin, “A Blake Drawing Rediscovered and Redated,” Blake 34.1 (summer 2000): cover, 22-24. but the auction included numerous works by Blake’s circle and followers. These are listed below under each       artist’s name.
  
The       auction market for important works by Blake concluded in December with the       “Enoch” lithograph (illus. 15) formerly in the collection of Edward       Croft-Murray (1907-80), keeper of the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British       Museum from 1954 to 1973. This is       one of four known impressions and one of only two remaining in private hands at       the time of this auction. The       verso bears an important inscription by George Cumberland describing the way       Blake modified the lithographic process. Unfortunately, Cumberland used a very wet ink       that soaked through to the recto and stained the area above the central figure’s       head. Given this show-through and       the other condition issues described in the caption to illus. 15, I thought the       print was overestimated at £100,000-150,000. My prophetic powers failed once again; “Enoch” fetched a       hammer price of £170,000 (£205,250 including the buyer’s premium) to a dealer       on the telephone representing an American institution. I believe that this is the second       highest price for any single print by Blake, exceeded only by the $3.9 million achieved       by the large color print of The Good and       Evil Angels Struggling for Possession of a Child (Butlin #324) sold at       auction in 2004. I suspect that       this is also a record price for a lithograph by a British artist.
 
The       year of all sales and catalogues in the following lists is 2012  unless       indicated otherwise. Most reports       about auction catalogues are based on the online versions.  Coverage of regional auctions is       selective. Dates for dealers’       online catalogues are the dates accessed, not the dates of  publication. Works offered online by dealers and       previously listed in any one of the last three sales reviews are  not repeated       here. Most of the auction houses       add their purchaser’s surcharge to the hammer price in their price  lists. These net amounts are given here,       following the official price lists. The value-added tax levied  against the buyer’s surcharge in Britain is       not included. Late 2012 sales will       be covered in the 2013 review. I       am grateful for help in compiling this review to G. E. Bentley,  Jr., Nancy Bialler, David Bindman, Calvin D. Brown, Mark Crosby,       Stephen Eisenman, Louis Girling,       Jr., Judith Guston, Erin Jue,       Richard Lloyd, Nicholas Lott, Hope Mayo, Patrick Murphy, Alan  Parker, Max Reed,       Ann Vershbow, Joseph Viscomi, and John Windle. My special thanks  go to Alexander       Gourlay for his generosity in keeping me abreast of eBay auctions.  Once again, Sarah Jones’s editorial       expertise and John Sullivan’s electronic imaging have been  invaluable.

For Children: The Gates of Paradise, BB pl. 15 (inscribed “13” lower left). Larkhall Fine Art, Dec. 2011 private offer (acquired by Essick). See illus. 1.
 
 
1. For Children: The Gates of Paradise, pl. 15.   Inscribed “13” lower left and “Fear and Hope are __ Vision” centered  below the design.  Etching, possibly with a few touches of  engraving, pictorial image 7.3 x 6.6 cm., platemark 8.1 x 7.2 cm., 2nd  st., datable to 1793.  Laid paper without watermark, leaf 8.5 x  7.4 cm., chain lines running vertically 2.75 cm. apart.   Provenance: private collection, England; sold in a mixed lot at a  Rosebery’s auction, London, fall 2011, to the print dealer Nicholas Lott  of Larkhall Fine Art, Bath; acquired by Essick 30 Dec. 2011.  Lott  has not been able to obtain any further information about the history  of ownership. Click to show more.

 
 
In the 1st st. of the pl., the background behind the  hovering figure is hatched with lines rising from right to left.   This area has been changed into dense crosshatching in this 2nd st.  The inscription reads “Fear or Hope are __ Vision” in the 1st st.; “or” is replaced with an ampersand in the 2nd st.  The area where the number “13” is printed lower left in the 2nd st. shows only fragments of printing, and may have been abraded, in the only known impression of the 1st st., present in copy A of For Children.  Blake added the number in pen and ink further to the left in copy A.  The 2nd sts. of all other pls. in For Children  include a 1793 imprint, but the space between the inscription and the  lower edge of the copperplate was insufficient to contain the imprint on  pl. 15.  The 2nd st. is present in For Children  copies B, D, E, and probably C (not seen; last recorded in the  collection of Lucinda Collins, New York).  Copies A, B, D, and E of  For Children are on wove paper.  The laid paper of the  print reproduced here suggests that it may be a one-off impression  pulled by Blake in 1793 to check his 2nd st. revisions, since he is not known to have used such paper to print complete copies of the work.  
 
When Blake converted For Children into For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise,  he extensively revised this pl. in 3 stages, c. 1818-26, in accord with  his new sense of adding contrasting effects of illumination and  darkness to etchings and engravings executed years earlier.  In the  3rd st. of pl. 15, the 1st For the Sexes  st., present in copy B, Blake burnished an aura of light around the  head and torso of the hovering figure.  Other areas have been  darkened with additional lines, including the beard and body of the  corpse, the clothing of the woman behind the bed and the child on the  right, and the back of the man in the foreground lower left.   Oddly, the right hand and cuff at the wrist of the corpse have vanished,  replaced by long horizontal lines defining his gown.  The facial  features of the child furthest right have been more clearly defined in  ways that hint at surprise or wonder; the woman’s features, particularly  her eyebrows, have been augmented.  Bold vertical lines added to  the background now suggest a curtain rather than an unadorned  wall.  Some of the letters in the caption, particularly the left  vertical of “H,” may have been cut more deeply.  
 
Illumination around the hovering figure has been extended in the 4th st. (copies C and D of For the Sexes)  and now includes lines of radiance right and left.  Burnishing has  created 2 other highlights, right and left of the foreground man’s  right leg.  Further hatching strokes now darken the background, the  floor lower right, the legs of the bed, the back and left leg of the  foreground man, and a patch on the floor above and to the right of his  right foot.  A stippled line now extends down his lower right  leg.  A few short lines have been added to the hovering spirit’s  hair where it falls along the back of his head.  The beard of the  corpse is more distinctly defined and rudimentary outlines of his right  hand and the cuff at the wrist, both present in the 1st and 2nd  sts., have been returned to the pl.  The face of the child  immediately right of the woman has been turned from right profile to  forward.  His mouth is open in wonder.  All 5 faces are  augmented with short lines and stipple to increase their expressiveness.   
 
Blake continued to supplement the 4th st. revisions in the 5th (final) st., found in copies E-I, K, and N of For the Sexes,  and in a separate impression of pl. 15 in the British Museum, accession  no. 1894,0612.29.  The letters of the caption have been further  strengthened and printed more darkly.  This additional work is most  evident on the right vertical of “H.”  The hovering figure’s aura  has been reduced in extent, particularly on the right, but intensified  around his head, under his left upper arm, and left of his right  elbow.  The background upper left, the floor lower right, the back  and right leg of the foreground man, the side of the bed right of his  right knee and the right end of the bed, the feet of the corpse, and the  legs of the hovering spirit have been darkened with hatching and  crosshatching.  Two lines now define the hem or cuff of breeches or  tights just above the foreground man’s right knee.  The faces of  the woman and children are more detailed; the former now has a wrinkled  brow and the latter have larger, more open mouths with clearly defined  lips.  
 
The 5 sts. of pl. 15 accord with the 5 print runs of The Gates of Paradise, 2 of For Children and 3 of For the Sexes.  These printings are assigned approximate dates in BB  187, 197: early spring 1793, late spring 1793, 1818, 1825, and 1827-28,  the last including some posthumous impressions.  Each time Blake  printed the work, he altered at least some of the pls.  BB 197 places copy E of For the Sexes  in the second (1825) printing of that work, but it should probably be  included in the third (1827-28) printing with other copies containing  the 5th st. of pl. 15.  For the Sexes copy A is untraced.  BB  197 groups it with the 1818 watermark and printing date of copy  B.  If that is indeed accurate, then pl. 15 in copy A is probably  in the 3rd st.  Copies J and L of For the Sexes lack pl. 15. Nicholas Lott tells me that copy M of For the Sexes, dispersed in the late 1960s by the London print dealer Christopher Mendez (BBS 79), is a group of Muir facsimiles.  A complete and detailed cat. of all sts. of all pls. in The Gates of Paradise has yet to be written.
 
Pl. 15 addresses the difference between material and spiritual  vision, a theme central to the entire series of emblem-like  designs.  Chauncey Brewster Tinker identifies the hovering figure  as God and compares the design to the vision of God in the whirlwind in  the pl. numbered 13 among the Job engravings—see Tinker, Painter and Poet  (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1938) 113.  Most interpreters, however,  describe this figure as the ghost or spirit of the dead man lying  stiffly supine on the bed.  This majority view is substantiated by  the insubstantial nature of the bearded apparition.  The line  defining his left shin extends across the right foot of the corpse, yet  we can see the toes of that foot and the upper portion of the corpse’s  left foot.  These appendages would be obscured if we could not see  through the spirit’s left leg.  Further, we can see the upper edge  of the board on the right end of the bed that would be invisible if we  could not see through the spirit’s left ankle.  The hovering figure  is “the Immortal Man that cannot Die” in Blake’s reference to the pl.  numbered “13” in “The Keys of the Gates,” the explanatory verses he  added to the series in For the Sexes (E 268-69).  Analogues for pl. 15 more apt than the Job  engraving are “To Tirzah,” in which “Whate’er is Born of Mortal Birth”  is “Raised a Spiritual Body” (E 30), and “The Death of the Good Old Man”  among Blake’s illus. to Robert Blair’s The Grave, another design picturing both the mortal and the immortal body.
 
The man half-kneeling in the foreground reacts to the vision with  amazement and perhaps fear.  The fingers of his right hand separate  and radiate outward; the toes of his right foot may be curled.   The woman behind the bed looks up in wonder.  The faces of the 2  children right of the woman express a similar emotion only in later sts.  of the pl.  This would appear to be a family group, but their  individual identities are uncertain.  Archibald G. B. Russell  refers to the kneeling man as the woman’s “husband” (Russell, The Engravings of William Blake [London: Grant Richards, 1912] 64).  Russell, however, fails to see the body on the bed, stating that “a young [sic?]  woman sits up upon a bed of sickness,” and he may be wrong about the  kneeling man as well.  He looks a good deal younger than the woman,  particularly in the last 2 sts., and may be the dead man’s “eldest son”  (David V. Erdman, The Illuminated Blake [Garden City: Anchor  P—Doubleday, 1974] 275).  Geoffrey Keynes describes the group as “a  man and his wife and two children seated beside the deathbed of a  father or a friend” (Keynes, commentary in Blake, The Gates of Paradise [London: Trianon P, 1968] 1: 18).  
 
The hovering spirit points upward to heaven with a finger on his left  hand and down and to the right with his right hand, probably to direct  the family toward a burial plot for the man’s corpse.  Taken  together, these gestures indicate the different destinies of spiritual  and material bodies.  The right-hand gesture also leads the reader  of The Gates of Paradise to the next 2 engravings in the  series, “The Traveller” who “hasteth in the Evening” of life in pl. 16  toward “Death’s Door” in pl. 17 (E 266-67).
 
The caption refers to the “Fear” of death and “Hope” for an  afterlife; the former may be part of the family’s understandable but  mistaken response to a vision proving that the latter is not in  vain.  “Vision” in Blake’s writings is closely associated with  imagination: “Vision or Imagination is a Representation of what  Eternally Exists” (A Vision of the Last Judgment, E 554).   The caption links together universal human emotions and the creative  activities of the artist that reveal spiritual realities beyond the  material veil.  Yet the operative verb, “are,” indicates more than  “leads to” or “causes.”  The internal emotions are one with the  external vision; both are products of mental acts.  This is not the  only passage in Blake’s writings in which process becomes identity: “…  he became what he beheld / He became what he was doing …” (The Four Zoas, E 338).
 
The preliminary pencil sketch for the design on p. 61 of Blake’s  Notebook (Butlin #201.61) appears above a related inscription, “What we  hope we see” (E 801).  This caption, like the engraved version,  also underscores the unity of inner (“hope”) and outer (“what we … see”)  realities, but may also play upon another reading of these 5 words:  this vision of the immortal man is what we hope to see at the death of  the mortal body.  Glue spots indicate that Blake very probably  affixed thin paper to the drawing and traced it for transfer to a  copperplate for The Gates of Paradise.  He did not,  however, reverse the design onto the copper, since right and left in  impressions are the reverse of the drawing.  The same basic  composition also appears in a large wash drawing datable to c. 1780-85  and inscribed “The spirit of a just man newly departed appearing to his  mourning family” (Butlin #135).  This title would appear to be in  Blake’s hand and supports the identification of the hovering figure as  the dead man’s spirit.  The woman’s right hand (left in the print)  is pictured in both drawings; her fingers are spread apart in a gesture  similar to the foreground man’s in all 3 versions.  The dead man’s  face is clearly pictured only in the wash drawing.

Songs of Innocence copy Y.  SNY, 26  April, #42-47, 7 pls. only (of 15) on 7 leaves of wove paper, each leaf  bearing the blind-stamped collection mark of Heinrich Neuerburg (Walter  Neuerburg’s father) lower right.  Relief etchings, at least 3 pls.  with white-line etching, hand colored and with pen and black ink border  lines contiguous with the edges of the images.  Each pl. numbered  by Blake in pen and black ink top right, selected motifs outlined in pen  and black ink, some letters and pictorial motifs highlighted in shell  gold. Three stabholes from a prior binding in the  left margin, 2.7 cm. from the top hole to the middle hole and 3.3 cm.  from the middle hole to the bottom hole.BB 410 records the stabhole distances for Songs of Innocence  copy R at 2.6 and 3.5 cm. apart.  I suspect that the small differences  between these measurements and those recorded here for copy Y are the  result of different perceptions, different rulers, and perhaps different  treatment of the paper over the years.  The holes in both copies were  probably stabbed when copies R and Y were one; they may have been  created by Blake’s wife, Catherine, for a pamphlet-style binding of the  book in wrappers.  See illus. 2-8 and their captions for further details on each pl.  Offered in the following lots, each illus.: #42.  “The Blossom,” BB pl. 11, numbered “10” top right.  $74,500 to Adam Fuss, New York; estimate $40,000-60,000. 

 
2. “The Blossom” (BB pl. 11), Songs of Innocence  copy Y. Collection of Adam Fuss, New York.  Relief and white-line  etching with pen and ink outlining and hand coloring, numbered “10” top  right in pen and ink.  Image 10.7 x 7.2 cm. (see enlargement),  leaf of wove paper 20.9 x 14.6 cm.  Marginal stains from an  earlier mat and browning at the edges of the leaf, particularly the  top.  Printed in gray-black ink and hand colored, probably c. 1811  when Blake printed Songs of Innocence copy S, the Innocence pls. of combined Songs copy S, and Milton copies A-C in that color (see the caption to illus. 3  for more on this printing).  Several letters, including all those  in the title, have been overwritten in pen and brown ink.  Blake  used a similar pink wash to color the giant plant in copy F of Songs of Innocence and of Experience and a purple-pink hue in copies A and L, all datable to the mid-1790s.  The plant is colored gray-blue in Songs of Innocence copy G (1789), pink and gray in Songs of Innocence copy O (c. 1802), highlighted in blue in copy T of the combined Songs (1818), and tinted pink and blue in copy V of Songs of Innocence and of Experience  (1821).  The adult angel’s right wing is also blue in copy  V.  Blake colored the plant green in most early copies, but  emphasized its flame-like characteristics with yellow, orange, and red  tinting in late copies (for example, W, Y, Z, and AA of the combined Songs,  all datable to 1825-26).  The auction cat. (SNY, 26 April) states  that the coloring includes “shell gold” (that is, powdered gold  suspended in water and a gum or glue binder, applied by hand) and  “gouache.”  The presence of the latter medium is indicated by the  chalky appearance of the colors in the leaf extending below the text and  the base of the main stem, lower right.

 #43.  “The Lamb,” BB pl. 8, numbered “7” top right.   $40,625 to John Windle acting for the Victoria University Library,  Toronto; estimate $35,000-45,000.  E. J. Pratt Library, Victoria  University, Blake Suppl. no. 363. 
 
3. “The Lamb” (BB pl. 8), Songs of Innocence copy  Y.  Victoria University Library, Toronto.  Relief etching  with pen and ink outlining and hand coloring, numbered “7” top right in  pen and ink.  Image 11.6 x 7.6 cm. (see enlargement),  leaf of wove paper 20.7 x 14.6 cm.  Light marginal stains from an  earlier mat and browning at the edges of the leaf, particularly at the  top.  Printed in gray-black ink and hand colored, probably c. 1811  when Blake printed Songs of Innocence copy S, the Innocence pls. of combined Songs copy S, and Milton  copies A-C in that color.  Much of the text has been overwritten  in pen and brown ink, very probably to compensate for weak printing of  the letters.  Blake extended the grassy ground and shadows slightly  below the lower edge of the pl. and extended the thatched roof of the  cottage to the right edge of the pl. with washes and 2 horizontal  lines.  The cottage does not reach beyond the sapling in the etched  image.  The auction cat. (SNY, 26 April) states that the coloring  includes “shell gold.”

 
Blake may have printed “The Lamb” and “The Blossom” (illus. 2) c. 1811 specifically to augment his stock of Innocence  impressions and thereby have a supply sufficient to create a complete  copy—presumably the original condition of copy R/Y.  Because he  already had his press ready for printing and ink available for producing  the other illuminated books in gray-black ink noted above, it would  have taken very little additional effort to print these two pls.

 #44.  “Laughing Song,” BB pl. 15, numbered “14” top right.  $80,500 to an anonymous private collector on the telephone; estimate $40,000-50,000. 
 
4. “Laughing Song” (BB pl. 15), Songs of Innocence  copy Y.  Anonymous private collection.  Relief etching with  hand coloring, numbered “14” top right in pen and ink.  Image 11.2 x  6.6 cm. (see enlargement),  leaf of wove paper 20.7 x 15.0 cm.  Light marginal stains from an  earlier mat, browning at the edges of the leaf, particularly at the top,  and stains around the top and bottom stabholes.  Printed in dark  reddish-brown ink, possibly in 1795 when Blake printed Songs of Innocence and of Experience  copy O in a similarly heavy and wet ink of that color.  The ink in  all other pls. in copy R/Y was drier, more reticulated, and applied  with a lighter touch.  The tinting in the text area accords with  what we see throughout copy R/Y, but the coloring of the design above  the text is distinctly different.  The colors are deeper, bolder,  less translucent, and closer to primary tints than the pastel tones on  other pls.  The design was probably colored c. 1795, but the  transparent washes in the text area could have been added c. 1811 when  the pl. was numbered and included in copy R/Y.  The highlighting in  gold on the figures’ hair, the title letters, and the bird to the left  of the title was probably applied c. 1811.  The auction cat. (SNY,  26 April) states that the coloring includes “gouache.”  

 
The upper curve of the letter “s,” 2nd word in the final line of text, shows a small patch of opaque white; see the caption to illus. 7 for discussion.

 #45.  “The Ecchoing Green,” BB pls. 6-7, numbered “5” and  “6” top right.  $116,500 to the dealer James Cummins acting for the  Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections, Northwestern  University Library, Evanston, Illinois; estimate $70,000-100,000. 
 
5. “The Ecchoing Green,” 1st pl. (BB pl. 6), Songs of Innocence  copy Y.  Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections,  Northwestern University Library, Evanston, Illinois.  Relief  etching with pen and ink outlining and hand coloring, numbered “5” top  right in pen and ink.  Image 11.0 x 7.0 cm. (see enlargement),  leaf of wove paper 20.0 x 14.2 cm.  Light marginal stains from an  earlier mat and browning at the edges of the leaf.  Printed in  light brown ink, probably c. 1802, and probably colored (at least in  part) at that time.  Copy O of Songs of Innocence  (University of Texas, Austin) was printed in the same session using the  same paper and ink.  Hand coloring and numbering not finished until  c. 1811.  Blake has drawn short horizontal lines below and within  the hoop right of the 1st stanza to indicate the ground on  which the boy plays.  He has also added a vine lower right; it  loops over a poorly printed part of the vine above and extends over the  catchword, “They.”  The title letters have been overwritten in dark  brown ink.  The auction cat. (SNY, 26 April) states that the  coloring includes “shell gold.”

6. “The Ecchoing Green,” 2nd pl. (BB pl. 7), Songs of Innocence  copy Y.  Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections,  Northwestern University Library, Evanston, Illinois.  Relief  etching, possibly with touches of white-line etching, and with pen and  ink outlining and hand coloring, numbered “6” top right in pen and  ink.  Image 11.0 x 7.0 cm. (see enlargement),  leaf of wove paper 20.9 x 14.8 cm. with a BUTTA[NSHAW] (probably  BUTTANSHAW 1802) watermark along the lower edge of the leaf.  Light  marginal stains from an earlier mat and browning at the edges of the  leaf.  Printed in light brown ink, probably c. 1802, and probably  colored (at least in part) at that time.  Hand coloring and  numbering not finished until c. 1811.  In the etched image, the  chin of the boy in the vine on the right, who is handing a bunch of  grapes to a girl below, is behind his hunched shoulder.  In this  impression, Blake has drawn the boy’s full face in front of his  shoulder.  The auction cat. (SNY, 26 April) states that the  coloring includes “shell gold.”

 #46.  “The Little Boy Lost,” BB pl. 13, numbered “12” top  right.  $59,375 to John Windle acting for Essick; estimate  $10,000-20,000.  See the caption to illus. 7 for the reasons the  auctioneer placed an estimate on this lot lower than the others. 
 
7. “The Little Boy Lost” (BB pl. 13), Songs of Innocence  copy Y.  Essick collection. Relief and white-line etching with pen  and ink outlining and hand coloring, numbered “12” top right in pen and  ink.  Image 11.2 x 7.3 cm. (see enlargement),  leaf of wove paper 20.7 x 14.6 cm.  Printed in light brown ink,  probably c. 1802, and probably colored (at least in part) at that  time.  Hand coloring and numbering not finished until c.  1811.  Blake overwrote all but a few letters in dark and light  brown inks.  The boy’s hat, simply etched in the copperplate, has  been emphasized with black pen and ink lines.  Blake gave similar  attention to the tree’s roots, only suggested in the etched image.   A thin black pen and ink line below the child’s feet indicates a shadow  cast by the illumination on the left.  The face of the angel right  of the 2nd stanza is in profile facing right in the etched  image, but has been drawn in three-quarters view in this  impression.  The general coloring of the design above the text,  including the long but weak beams of light radiating from the  illuminated “vapour” on the left, is similar to the impressions in copy O  of Songs of Innocence (c. 1802) and in copy V of Songs of Innocence and of Experience  (1821).  There are no beams or rays of light in the etched  image.  The duck, etched on the copperplate above the “y” of “Boy”  in the title, has almost disappeared in this copy Y impression due to  light inking.  The boy’s hair and the tree trunk show minute  touches of shell gold.  Erin Jue, paper conservator at the  Huntington Library, suggests that these few grains of gold may have been  transferred to this impression from residue left on the brush after a  more generous, and hence visually significant, application of gold on  other pls.

A condition report, not published in the printed auction cat. of 26  April but available on Sotheby’s web site, includes the following  caveat: “There are corrections in the text which are not entirely  consistent with the hand-retouchings characteristic of Blake’s own  work.  It is difficult to be certain whether this portion of the  plate was damaged and touched up by a later hand, or whether it was  indeed by Blake himself.”  Sotheby’s cautious statement was  motivated by the unusual presence of opaque white pigment, possibly lead  white, surrounding letters in the text.  This material is most  evident around the 1st 2 letters of the 2nd and 3rd  words in line 1 and in an area below “you” in the same line and between  it and the next word, extending toward the bird flying above the 1st letter of “going.”  Dabs of white are also visible throughout the 1st half of each line in the 2nd  stanza.  In 2 areas—the left side of the vertical of the “h” of  “child” and the right side of the “e” of “wet,” both in the 2nd line of the 2nd  stanza—the opaque white intrudes upon the letters, partly covering  their edges.  There are as well 4 droplets of white over part of  the lower reaches of the 1st “g” in “going” in the 1st line of the text.  Thus, the white pigment must have been applied after the letters were overwritten in pen and ink.
 
The opaque white was added with considerable skill and attention to detail.  For example, the terminal letter of “The,” 1st word of the 2nd  stanza, was touched with white to create the space within the upper  loop.  Most of this work becomes clearly discernable only under  magnification.  Blake may have added the white to increase the  contrast between the letters and their surrounding areas.  It is of  course possible that the opaque pigment was applied by someone else  after the print left Blake’s hands, perhaps even following the fire that  reportedly injured Songs of Innocence copy R/Y in the  1890s.  The reason for such intervention, however, is far from  clear.  There is no evidence of staining or any other damage to the  paper underlying the opaque white when the leaf is viewed through a  strong backing light.  There are several light brown stains on the  verso, but these do not correlate with the white patches on the  recto.  See also illus. 4 and 8  and their captions for more applications of opaque white.  Both  “The Little Boy Lost” and “The Little Boy Found” were inspected under a  Meiji binocular microscope with a magnification range of 7x to  45x.  An enlargement of approximately 15x proved to be the most  useful for locating and studying the white areas.

 #47.  “The Little Boy Found,” BB pl. 14, numbered “13” top right.  $68,500 to John Windle acting for Essick; estimate $35,000-45,000. 
 
8. “The Little Boy Found” (BB pl. 14), Songs of Innocence  copy Y.  Essick collection.  Relief and white-line etching  with pen and ink outlining and hand coloring, numbered “13” top right in  pen and ink.  Image 11.7 x 7.2 cm. (see enlargement),  leaf of wove paper 20.8 x 14.6 cm.  Printed in light brown ink,  probably c. 1802, and probably colored (at least in part) at that  time.  Hand coloring and numbering not finished until c.  1811.  Although there is far less opaque white pigment than in “The  Little Boy Lost,” the space between the 1st 2 letters of the title and the area within the looping lower element of the 2nd letter bear streaks of that color, possibly intended to mask a flaw of some sort (see the caption to illus. 7).  Two droplets also appear above and within the 1st  letter (“H”) in line 5 of the poem, although these could be accidental  spills.  Tinting with light brown wash in the space between the  design and the edges of the copperplate forms a frame on 3 sides of the  design.  Brown stains slightly mar the lower abdomen of Christ, the  adult figure in the design above the text.  Blake has given an  unusual amount of attention to the outlining of Christ’s left thumb and  fingers where they grasp the boy’s right elbow.  The adult’s hand  is apparently under the child’s arm, for the fingers extend upwards with  the thumb looping around from above and extending downwards.   Christ’s hand, fingers pointing down, holds the boy’s arm from above in  copy Y of the combined Songs, datable to 1825; the hand position is uncertain in most copies.  

 
The roots of the tree on the right have been emphasized with wash and  pen and ink outlines.  The background landscape is more open and  more illuminated than in any other impression known to me.   Although still crepuscular in overall tone, this impression and the one  in Songs of Innocence copy O (c. 1802) are less distinctly  night scenes than others.  The leafy canopy of a dense forest rises  behind the boy; 2 tree trunks are visible below his left arm.  The  sky above the boy’s head includes 2 arching bands of light between  clouds.  The figure hovering right of the text lacks a nose in the  etched image, supplied in this impression with pen and ink  outlining.  This figure’s billowing gown, all 3 large tree trunks,  and the boy’s hair are tinted with shell gold, either mixed with other  colors or applied thinly on top of them.

 
  
Drawings and Paintings
 
Bearded Man and a Youth, possibly by  Blake.  Pen and ink drawing, size unknown but less than the leaves  of the Tulk family album, 27.0 x 22.0 cm., into which the drawing was  mounted.  Probably dating from the 1780s.  Not in Butlin  because not discovered until 2010.  Acquired spring 2012 by Lowell  Libson, Ltd., London. 

A male wearing breeches, a shirt, and a sandal on  his right foot (left not shown) sits facing forward on a stone (?) step  or plinth.  His thick hair, prominent arched eyebrows, moustache,  and short beard are darkly inked; his expression is solemn.  His  right hand rests, palm down and fingers spread, on the step.  He  points with his left index finger at a tablet or piece of paper, lower  right, bearing a few squiggles indicating writing.  A round object  at its left (presumably lower) edge may be a wax seal.  A nude, or  partly nude, youth of uncertain gender, possibly a long-haired male,  kneels on the floor between the bearded man’s legs.  He faces  right, with eyes partly closed or perhaps looking down at the writing,  but his shoulders are twisted away from the viewer and his raised hands  rest upon the bearded man’s shoulders.  The combination of motifs,  particularly the tablet or paper, suggests a specific subject, but I  have not been able to determine it.  Any suggestions?
 
The attribution to Blake is far from certain.  At  first glance, the drawing, particularly the head of the bearded man,  does not shout “Blake.”  The same can be said for a somewhat  similar pen and ink drawing, Charon, Copy from the Antique  (Butlin #178 recto, dated to c. 1779-80?).  Without Tatham’s  inscription vouching that the work is by Blake, I would be a bit dubious  about Charon; see also A Male Nude with an Urn, Copy from the Antique  (Butlin #179A).  Several characteristics, however, associate the  drawing from the Tulk album with Blake’s stylistic habits.  If we  “attend to the Hands and Feet” (A Vision of the Last Judgment,  E 560) and the musculature of the youth, Blake’s own hand begins to  emerge.  Indeed, attribution would be more certain if one simply  ignores the bearded head.

Harpers and Other Drawings (recto), preliminary sketches for America and Europe (verso).  Pencil, leaf 20.4 x 24.6 cm.  Not in Butlin because not discovered until 2010.  Lowell Libson, Oct. online cat., titled A Double-Sided Sheet of Drawings: Job and His Wife Playing Instruments, recto and verso illus. (price on request).A price of £300,000 was quoted to me in Oct. on the telephone.  This is a record asking price for a pencil drawing by Blake.  See illus. 9-11. 

 
9. Harpers and Other Drawings.  Pencil, leaf 20.4 x 24.6 cm. (see enlargement).   Datable to 1792-93.  For the verso, see illus. 10.  See the caption to illus. 12 for information on the album from which this leaf was removed.

 
The main, central drawing of a man and woman playing harps and  perhaps singing might be Job and his wife after their restoration to  prosperity, as in the final pl. of Blake’s Job engravings, but there are  reasons to question this identification.  Even in the earliest Job  designs, such as Job, His Wife and His Friends: The Complaint of Job  (Butlin #162, dated to c. 1785), Job has long hair, an exceptionally  long beard, and is clearly old.  The man in this drawing is  middle-aged, has short and tightly curled hair, and a short beard.   Playing harps does not necessarily indicate a Job subject; see, for  example, A Harper and Other Sketches (the verso of Butlin #81, dated to c. 1785; for illus. and discussion, see Blake 39.1 [summer 2005]: 44-47).  A Tiriel wash drawing untraced since 1863, Har and Heva Playing Harps (Butlin #198.5, dated to c. 1789), might be related, although the age of Har and Heva in other Tiriel designs matches Job and his wife rather than the couple in this pencil drawing.

The recto bears several other sketches, apparently unrelated to the central drawing: • Far left, a youthful male nude with curly hair, facing forward but  looking down and to the right.  He stands in front of a stone  wall(?) and leans with his right elbow on a shovel.  His lower  right arm extends behind his back.  An almost identical figure,  except for slight differences in the angle of the head, appears on the  general title page in Blake’s watercolor illus. to Edward Young’s Night Thoughts (Butlin #330.2, dated to c. 1795-97).  As in the Night Thoughts  design, this may be a grave-digger in an elegant pose reminiscent of  classical sculpture.  Blake probably referred back to this pencil  drawing when executing the watercolor. • Above the central drawing, a pair of overlapping figures, probably  female, hovering horizontally or flying to the right.  The front  figure extends her right arm in front of her; small objects or the  droplets of a liquid descend diagonally from her right hand.  The  similar motif of a sky-borne figure pouring down a liquid appears in Visions of the Daughters of Albion  pl. 4.  In the pencil sketch, the figure in back extends her left  arm; cloud outlines appear above and to the right.  The pair is  generally similar to (but not a direct preliminary for) the angels at  the top of Blake’s design for the title page to Night the First among  his Night Thoughts watercolors (Butlin #330.6), pl. 1 among the engravings (BB #515).  Unlike this pencil drawing, the Night Thoughts angels are winged and nothing drops from their hands. • To the right of the central harpists, a standing female(?) seen in  right profile, leaning back slightly with her right arm extended upward  to touch or hold a descending child or putto in left profile, his left  hand touching the adult’s right shoulder.  The figures appear to be  kissing.  This drawing is probably the direct preliminary for the  same motif in Blake’s relief-etched color print “A Dream of Thiralatha” (SP IX), first executed as a pl. for America,  1793, but not used in the illuminated book.  In this sketch, the  putto’s legs are together, with the right calf and foot just peeking out  from behind the left leg.  In the print, his right leg is bent at  the knee and his left leg extended.  Right and left in this sketch  are the reverse of impressions of the color print and thus the figures  have the same orientation as the design on the copperplate. • Far right, a standing child seen from behind, reaching upward with  both arms to touch or hold a descending child, also seen from  behind.  They may be kissing.  A few sketchy lines above and  right of the figures hint at clouds.  This may be a rejected  variant for the “Thiralatha” design.

10. Preliminary sketches for America and Europe, the verso of Harpers and Other Drawings (illus. 9).  Pencil, leaf 20.4 x 24.6 cm. (see enlargement).  Datable to 1792-93.  See the caption to illus. 12 for information on the album from which this leaf was removed. Click to show more.

 
 
The leaf bears small sketches of 15 figures.  Most, possibly all, are preliminary sketches for motifs in America and Europe, as follows: • Lower right, two figures, likely a male (right) and woman (left—note  the indications of female breasts) fleeing to the right over the outline  of a hilly landscape, probably a variant design for the man and woman  lower left in America pl. 5.  In this sketch, the figure  on the left has her arms bent at the elbows and raised over her head;  her companion has his arms raised at roughly 135 degrees.  In the  relief etching, the male has his arms down, with his right hand  apparently holding the hand of a child; the female raises her left arm  vertically and her right forearm and hand are visible left of her lower  torso. • Top and center, a male holding a contracted figure on his shoulders, a  female (note the carefully delineated vagina) with a sword, a male  holding scales with the outlines of clouds extending above and below  him, and an upside-down male within the upper loop of a spiraling  serpent, all for America pl. 7.  In the etching, the  figure holding a sword may be male, prominent flames have been added to  the weapon, the cloud is differently configured, and the serpent’s head  is in a slightly altered position.  The placement of the figures in  relationship to each other is retained, but with right and left  reversed in impressions. • Center right, a male facing down and clutching his head, for America pl. 7.  The sketched and etched versions are almost identical. • Upper right quadrant, another sketch of the man clutching his head, for America  pl. 7, accompanied by two other figures, or variants of the same  figure, also clutching their heads.  These may all be Blake’s  experiments with various postures in preparation for the relief etching. • Lower left quadrant, an upside-down, descending male with a large weight attached to him, for Europe  pl. 4.  In the sketch, the man’s legs are bent sharply at the  knees and his genitals are clearly pictured.  In the illuminated  book, his legs are turned to the left with his right thigh covering his  lower torso. • Lower left, a falling female.  See illus. 11. • Lower margin, a series of three figures above the outline of a rocky  landscape.  From left to right, these are a female with long hair,  lunging and reaching dramatically to the left; an upside-down male seen  from behind, arms extended downward with hands resting on a boulder or  small hill, right leg extended upward and left leg bent at the knee,  basically similar to The Book of Urizen pl. 14; a female figure  facing forward with prominent breasts and a large belly, arms  horizontal and legs bent at the knees and spread apart.  This last  figure may be pregnant; compare to the woman giving birth in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell pl. 3.  None of these figures is present in America or Europe, but they were probably executed in preparation for those books. 

For each figure used in America and Europe,  right and left are the reverse of impressions of the illuminated books  and thus the motifs in this drawing have the same orientation as the  designs on the copperplates.  These drawings reinforce the  interrelatedness of America and Europe, compositionally and thematically.  For a leaf of pencil drawings for America of similar size and date, see Sketches for “America” and Other Books (Butlin #226), illus. and discussed in Blake 45.4 (spring 2012): 111-12.

11. Preliminary sketches for America and Europe (illus. 10),  detail of pencil sketch lower left, approximately 3.7 x 3.2 cm.  A  falling female, seen from behind, with legs spread apart and bent  sharply at the knees.  The creature above her rump is exceedingly  odd and thus invites speculation.  Joseph Viscomi has suggested in  correspondence that this is a goat, facing forward, left front hoof  delineated, with symmetrically curving horns, a bifurcated forelock,  floppy ears, bulging eyes, and a prominent muzzle.  Is this a scene  of interspecies coitus or rape?  “The lust of the goat” (The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,  E 36) has been the animal’s main emblematic characteristic since  antiquity.  As a symbol of the zodiacal sign of Capricorn, the goat  is sometimes given a fish-like body with 2 twisting tails (see, for  example, the impresa of Cosimo de’ Medici reproduced in James Hall, Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art,  rev. ed. [New York: Icon Editions, 1974] 139).  This tradition may  account for the 2 tails in this drawing, 1 possibly wrapped around the  woman’s left thigh and clearly visible right of her left knee, and  another extending around her face and head and trailing along her  back.  Viscomi further suggests that Blake first drew a phallus  penetrating the woman, then transformed it into a goat.  This may  account for the columnar shape of the animal’s body.  The sexual  implications of the design anticipate some of Blake’s drawings in the Four Zoas  manuscript, begun c. 1796.  The ovoid form above and to the left  of the descending figure’s head remains mysterious.  Not used in America or Europe, but probably executed in preparation for those books.

Parental Affection, or the Meeting of a Family in Heaven (recto), Sisyphus Rolling the Stone up a Hill  (verso).  Recto watercolor, verso pencil, leaf 14.3 x 9.2  cm.  Not in Butlin because not discovered until 2010.  Lowell Libson, June online cat., recto and verso illus. (price on request).I  received a report from a prominent Blake collector that the watercolor  was offered to him for £550,000.  I have not been able to confirm this  extraordinary price.  See illus. 12-14. 
 
 
12. Parental Affection, or the Meeting of a Family in Heaven.   Watercolor on laid paper, 14.3 x 9.2 cm.  The title is apparently a  recent invention, probably by the dealer Lowell Libson or one of his  unnamed consultants.  See illus. 14 for the  verso.  When mounted in an album (see provenance below), the leaf  to which the watercolor was attached was inscribed in pencil “Parents  meeting.”  Blake based the design on an emblem drawing in his  Notebook, p. 41 (illus. 13).  The major  differences between the two versions are the addition of more background  trees and the elaboration of the Gothic architecture in the  watercolor.  The date of the Notebook emblems is not certain, but  they have generally been dated to c. 1790-92; some were engraved and  published in For Children: The Gates of Paradise of 1793.

This watercolor is similar in style and mood to the wash drawings illustrating Mary Wollstonecraft’s Original Stories from Real Life  (Butlin #244, dated c. 1791).  A date of c. 1790-92 seems  reasonable for this watercolor, although far from certain.  The  work shows some similarities to, but is more carefully executed than, a  few drawings dated by Butlin to the late 1780s, including An Enthroned Old Man Offering Two Children to Heaven (Butlin #88) and Age Teaching Youth (Butlin #91).  Parental Affection was advertised by Libson and reproduced in Art Newspaper no. 236 (June 2012); see also brief comments and illus. in Anon., “Forthcoming Events,” British Art Journal 13.1 (spring 2012): 96, Huon Mallalieu, “Drawn to Success,” Country Life 206.26 (27 June 2012): 112-13, Richard Green, “Master Drawings,” Burlington Magazine 154 (Sept. 2012): 651, and Mallalieu, “From the Zoo to the Big Apple,” Country Life 206.40 (2 Oct. 2012): 114-15.  The work is in a remarkably fine state of preservation, the colors fresh and unfaded.
 
The reference in the title to “the Meeting of a Family in Heaven” implies a connection with Blake’s illus. to Robert Blair’s The Grave  and perhaps a source for the subject in the writings of Emanuel  Swedenborg.  The latter would be appropriate for a work given or  sold to C. A. Tulk, a Swedenborgian.  The naturalistic landscape  background, however, makes a heavenly setting unlikely.  For an  illus. of Blake’s “Meeting of a Family in Heaven” in the 1808 ed. of  Blair’s poem and a discussion of its relationship to Swedenborg’s  writings, see Blake 43.4 (spring 2010): 124-25.
 
Provenance: Probably acquired directly from Blake by Charles Augustus  Tulk (1786-1849), although Blake’s wife, Catherine (after her husband’s  death in 1827), or Tulk’s friend John Flaxman are possible sources;  Tulk’s daughter Louisa Susanna Tulk (1819-48?), who mounted this  watercolor in an album; by inheritance to her husband, James Peard Ley  (1807-85); by inheritance to his son, James Verchild Ley; by inheritance  to his son, James Richard Ley, who died in Feb. 2010; the estate of  James Richard Ley (sole heir his daughter, Judith Penelope Ley,  executors John Paul Hindle and Judith Penelope Ley); the entire album  sold by the estate spring or early summer 2012 to the London dealer  Lowell Libson Ltd. for an undisclosed price.  This watercolor, or  the leaf of recto/verso drawings reproduced here as illus. 9-10,  might be the “drawing” which Nancy Flaxman, in a letter to her husband,  John Flaxman, of July 1816, states was “bought … of him” (i.e., bought  from Blake) by “our Friend,” possibly C. A. Tulk (BR[2] 326). 

The Tulk family album from which this watercolor was removed in  2012 contains 90 pp. of Whatman paper, leaves 22.0 x 27.0 cm., bound in  calf, according to a representative of the Tulk estate.  It  included other works by Blake (see illus. 9-10, 14), Flaxman, and a good many drawings by other, probably Continental, artists.

14. Sisyphus Rolling the Stone up a Hill.  Pencil on leaf 14.3 x 9.2 cm., the verso of Parental Affection (illus. 12).   Although it seems unlikely that Blake would execute a rough sketch on  the verso of a finished watercolor probably intended for sale or  presentation, the vigorous style of this drawing suggests a slightly  later date than the recto, possibly in the mid-1790s.  See the  caption to illus. 12 for information on the album from which this leaf was removed.

Dante engravings.  SL, 29 March, #2, pl. 3 only,  “The Circle of the Corrupt Officials,” first described in the online  cat. as “possibly an early proof before the 1838 edition, a fine  impression printing with burr,” but changed by 23 March to “a very  early, fine impression from Linnell’s 1838 edition,” India paper laid  onto heavy wove and thus probably an impression on thick Colombier  backing paper (see the plate-printer’s records, BB 545), illus.  (not sold; highest bid £3800 on an estimate of £5000-7000).  SNY,  20 April, #32, complete set on laid India with a “letterpress cover  label,” pl. 6 “lightly stained,” India paper of 2 pls. evenly browned,  unbound in a half morocco folding case, illus. ($62,500; estimate  $20,000-30,000).
 
“Enoch,” modified lithograph.  CL, 6 Dec., #96, SP  impression 1B, recto and verso inscription illus. (£205,250; estimate  £100,000-150,000).  According to Richard Lloyd of Christie’s, the  purchaser was a “US Institution” (e-mail to John Windle, 8 Dec.  2012).  See comments in the introductory essay to this sales review and illus. 15.
 
 
15. “Enoch.” Modified lithograph, 21.7 x 31.0 cm., SP  impression 1B.  Wove paper without watermark, leaf 23.8 x 33.1  cm.  The pen and ink inscription by George Cumberland on the verso  has bled through to the recto above the central figure’s head, on the  hovering figures right and left, and in the top margin.  Light damp  staining top right corner, marginal tears extending into the image  right top margin and upper left margin.  The oval blemish, 1.2 x  0.8 cm., just below the center of the top framing line, is described in  the auction cat. (CL, 6 Dec., #96) as “a made up paper loss”—that is, a  hole in the printed leaf filled with another piece of paper.  For  discussion and illus. of the verso inscription, see Essick, “Blake’s  ‘Enoch’ Lithograph,” Blake 14.4 (spring 1981): 180-84.  The inscription is also transcribed and discussed in SP 55-59.

“George Cumberland’s  Card.”  CSK, 5 Dec., #192, “on card,” leaf 4.1 x 8.1 cm., illus.  (not sold; estimate £3000-4000).  Apparently an unrecorded  impression, acquired after the auction by John Windle for stock.
 
“The Idle Laundress,” after Morland, 1788.  Larkhall Fine Art, Dec. 2011 private offer, imprint trimmed off but probably 2nd st., color printed with hand coloring (£750).  See illus. 16.
 
 
16. “The Idle Laundress,” engraved by Blake after George  Morland.  Pictorial image including the framing lines 21.2 x 26.0  cm.  Leaf of wove paper without watermark trimmed within the  platemark to 24.5 x 28.9 cm. and with the imprint cut off.  Color  printed in black, brown, and blue inks and hand colored.  Essick  collection. 
The only clear distinctions in the pl. itself between the 2nd st., published by J. R. Smith in 1788, and the 3rd  st., published by H. Macklin in 1803, are the imprint and the amount of  wear in the fine stipple.  I suspect that this impression is in  the 2nd st.  The single impression of the 1st st. known to me, recorded in 1983 in the collection of John DeMarco, Saratoga, New York, is colored like this 2nd st.  The quality and extent of the color printing and hand coloring in the 3rd st. are similar, but with several changes in palette.  In 3rd-st.  impressions I’ve seen, the laundress’s skirt is pale brown, the young  thief’s jacket is dark brown, and his waistcoat is blue.

(£220; acquired by John Windle for stock and sold immediately to  Victoria University Library, Toronto, accession no. Blake Suppl. no.  389).The only other traced impression of this st. is in my collection; see BB 531 and Robert N. Essick and Morton D. Paley, Robert Blair’s The Grave Illustrated by William Blake  (London: Scolar Press, 1982) 219. Only the inscribed texts, not the  design itself, were altered (or at least recut with the graver) in later  sts. and printings.  Schiavonetti and his journeymen must have worked  very quickly to produce this print between Nov. 1805, the date of the  prospectus naming Blake as the engraver of his designs in R. H. Cromek’s  forthcoming ed. of The Grave, and Feb. 1806.  It was probably the 1st  pl. to be produced by Schiavonetti, possibly intended for advertising  purposes and as an immediate substitute for Blake’s own white-line  etching of the design, rejected by Cromek.  The copperplate was trimmed  from 35.7 x 20.3 cm. to 30.0 x 17.5 cm. before publication in Cromek’s  1808 folio 1st ed. of The Grave.  The impression in  my collection is on laid paper, leaf 39.2 x 24.8 cm., not the wove paper  recorded in Essick and Paley.  An impression of this proof st. with a  “J. Whatman, 1806” watermark, probably a wove paper, is recorded in A.  G. B. Russell, The Engravings of William Blake (London: Grant Richards, 1912) 130, then in the collection of F. W. Bourdillon but now untraced.   EB, June, 1808 quarto, scattered soiling and foxing, contemporary  boards rebacked with calf, illus. (offered at the “buy it now” price of  $2750); probably the same copy, Oct., illus. (offered at the same “buy  it now” price); Nov.-Dec., 1870 portfolio of pls. only as issued,  publisher’s cloth folder worn, illus.

Interesting Blakeana
 
The Judgment of Solomon after Raphael,  attributed to Blake.  Oil, 36.2 x 41.3 cm.  Leslie Hindman  auction, Chicago, 2 May, #403, illus. ($527).  Not by Blake, and  not to be confused with the watercolor Judgment of Solomon after Raphael that may well be by Blake.  For the watercolor, see Blake 36.4 (spring 2003): 116-19, illus. 3.
 
J. G. Stedman, Voyage à Surinam,  Paris, 1798.  EB, July, “Collection de Planches” (title page)  only, a quarto vol. of 44 pls. to accompany a French translation of  Stedman’s Narrative, contemporary (publisher’s?) quarter calf,  illus. ($1524.99).  Librairie B. Guilbert, July online cat., 3  vols. of text and 1 vol. of pls., half calf  (€4550).  La  Poussière du Temps, July online cat., 3 vols. of text and 1 vol. of  pls., contemporary sheep (€3500).  Gemilang, July online cat., pls.  vol. only, half calf (€2950).  HS Rare Books, July online cat., 3  vols. of text and 1 vol. of pls., foxed, 19th-century calf  worn (text vols.), later boards (pls. vol.), illus. ($3500).  These  French pls. were almost certainly copied after the pls. in the 1st ed. (1796) of Stedman’s book, including Blake’s pls. 1, 2, 4, 5, 8-10, 12, 13, and 15.  The French engraver signed each pl. “Tardieu l’ainé.”There  were at least 11 engravers named Tardieu active from the early 18th to  the mid-19th century.  The date of this publication and the death dates  of various members of the family suggest that the engraver of the pls.  for Stedman’s work was probably Jean Baptiste Pierre Tardieu  (1746-1816), who specialized in geographical subjects.  He may have  added “l’ainé” (the elder) to his name to distinguish his work from  engravings by his two younger brothers, Antoine François (1757-1822) and  Jean Baptiste Tardieu (1768-1837).
 
Antijacobin Review and Magazine, 1799-1820.  James Burmester, July cat. 85, #58, vols. 1-23, 25-27, 29-58, early 19th-century half calf worn (£2500).  Vol. 31, Nov. 1808 issue, includes a long review of Cromek’s ed. of Blair’s Grave with Blake’s illus.  The anonymous reviewer characterizes Blake’s designs as “absurd effusions” (BB #952).
 
J. Thomas, Religious Emblems, 1809.   Stuart Bennett, Nov. private offer, uncut in original boards rebacked  with roan, covers and spine worn ($600).  “William Blake, Esq.”  appears in the list of subscribers—see BB #746.  The  possibility that this is the poet and artist is increased by the fact  that Thomas commissioned some of Blake’s watercolors illustrating  Milton’s poetry—see Butlin #527, 529, 538.  For a discussion of  this book, see Karl Josef Höltgen, “Religious Emblems (1809) by John Thurston and Joseph Thomas and Its Links with Francis Quarles and William Blake,” Emblematica 10.1 (summer 1996): 107-43.
 
Lady’s Monthly Museum, vol. 12, Jan.-June  1812.  Panoply Books, Jan. online cat., contemporary (publisher’s?)  half calf worn ($175).  The June issue includes an anonymous  review of the 5th annual exhibition of the Associated  Painters in Water Colors (1812) with brief references to works Blake  exhibited.  The reviewer describes “No. 254” in the show, Blake’s  tempera painting of Sir Jeffery Chaucer and the Nine and Twenty Pilgrims on Their Journey to Canterbury (Butlin #653), as 

a picture of mongrel excellence; yet has such a  repulsive appearance, that we doubt most of our fair readers will  scarcely view it with pleasure, unless they should be well acquainted  with Aunciente tapestrye, to enter into its merits.  That  it is the work of genius, no one will deny; it possesses all the truth,  the costume, and manners of the times; and the artist is perhaps worthy  of the highest commendation for his industry, research, and correctness;  but for our parts, we feel ourselves so perfectly satisfied with the  same subject, as treated by Stothard, that we wish not to possess a  picture whose greatest merit seems to be an imitation of the arts in  their degraded state. (344)
 These comments indicate that the reviewer understood that Blake had  integrated into his work features of style and format recalling (or  reinventing) the pictorial arts of Chaucer’s time, yet the reviewer  cannot accept such historical references because “the arts” were then in  a “degraded state,” mockingly intimated by the faux-archaic spelling of  “Aunciente tapestrye.”  The reviewer apparently found the  painting disturbingly old fashioned, but Blake was ahead of his time in  his attempt at historical accuracy and in the appreciation of medieval  (or at least pre-Raphaelite) painting and tapestry.  The reviewer  “declines giving any criticism” of “pictures 323 and 324, by the same  artist [Blake],” because they are “too sublime for our comprehension,”  but labels them as “Fuselian” and “Angelesque” (344).  The works  displayed as 324 were “Detached Specimens of an original illuminated  Poem, entitled ‘Jerusalem the Emanation of the Giant Albion’ ”  (Associated Painters 1812 cat., 24).  The reference to “323” is  apparently an error; that work was a view of “Avo on the Alva, in the  Siera Estrulla, Portugal” by “J. Shetky” (1812 cat., 24).  As BBS 350 suggests, the reviewer may have intended to reference 279 and/or 280, Blake’s The Spiritual Form of Pitt Guiding Behemoth and The Spiritual Form of Nelson Guiding Leviathan (1812 cat., 21; Butlin #651, 649). 
A. and J. Taylor, City Scenes, 1818.  Ian Marr, Sept. cat. 5, #86, roan-backed boards worn (£275).  The 1st ed. of City Scenes to contain Blake’s “Holy Thursday” from Songs of Innocence.   The accompanying wood engraving shows boys being led out of church by  two beadles.  For an illus. of this print, see Blake 44.4 (spring 2011): 127, illus. 4.  BB #260A (see also p. 954, #260A).

(not sold or  possibly withdrawn; estimate $1200-1800).  Although the print was  offered as an original, the size of the platemark indicates that this is  the W. A. White facsimile of c. 1913 (BB #46, BBS 80), probably based on copy D of For the Sexes.  The platemark of original impressions is 9.3 x 6.3 cm.

W. Blake, Little Tom the Sailor, William Muir  facsimile, 1886.  EB, Oct.-Nov., the headpiece and tailpiece hand  colored, illus. ($1302).  See illus. 17. 
 
 
17. W. Blake, Little Tom the Sailor, lithographic  facsimile by William Muir, 1886.  Detail of the headpiece printed  in black ink, 11.2 x 16.2 cm., and the top margin.  Inscribed in  pen and brown ink “No 3 Wm Muir”  upper left, this headpiece and the tailpiece hand colored in imitation  of the British Museum copy of the original, full leaf of wove paper  without watermark 60.3 x 23.0 cm.  Essick collection.  The  only signed and numbered copy, and the only hand-colored copy, I have  ever seen.  According to the printed front wrapper of his 1887  facsimile of Europe, Muir states that his Little Tom  is “from Mr. Gilchrist’s copy,” now untraced.  The London book  dealer Bernard Quaritch, distributor of Muir’s facsimiles, records the  delivery from Muir of a “coloured” copy of Little Tom on 11 May 1925; see G. E. Bentley, Jr., “‘Blake … Had No Quaritch’: The Sale of William Muir’s Blake Facsimiles,” Blake 27.1 (summer 1993): 10.  Quaritch’s cat. 401 of May 1926 offers as item 243 a Muir facsimile of Little Tom  with “two illustrations coloured by hand from the copy in the British  Museum” for £1.1s.  This cat. dates the work to “1925,” apparently  the date of coloring, possibly of printing, but not of original  execution as a lithograph.  The same entry appears in Quaritch’s  Dec. 1926 cat. 405, item 256, 1929 cat. 427, item 248, and 1930 cat.  434, item 2065.

J. Miró, relief etching in imitation of Blake’s  method, 1947.  BL, 28 June, #175, poem by Ruthven Todd with illus.  by Miró, “soft-ground etching (the William Blake Method)” but probably a  relief etching, printed in 3 colors, 1 of 8 impressions printed by  Stanley William Hayter, wove paper 17.6 x 13.7 cm., illus. (not sold;  estimate £8000-10,000).  Lots 173-74 (not sold; estimates  £4000-6000 each) may be similar experiments by Miró, Todd, and Hayter in  Blake’s relief-etching techniques.  See Ruthven Todd, “William  Blake’s Illuminated Printing,” Print: A Quarterly Journal of the Graphic Arts 6.1 (1948): 53-64, also published as “William Blake’s Illuminated Painting [sic],” Print Collector’s Quarterly  29.3 (Nov. 1948): 25-[37].  Both publications of Todd’s essay  include a reproduction of a monochrome impression of the same work sold  by BL as #175.

(£1250); 14 Nov., #109, titled Master of the Universe,  bronze, 40.5 cm. long, signed and dated 1999, illus. (not sold;  estimate £40,000-60,000).  EB, Nov.-Dec., plaster relief plaque  attributed to Paolozzi, 19.1 x 24.1 cm., with several cracks in the  plaster and a bit crude but closer to Blake’s representation of Newton’s  body than Paolozzi’s monumental version in the forecourt of the British  Library, illus. (£78.89).

BARRY, JAMES
 
Compositional Study.  Pen and ink, 24.8 x 31.8 cm.  CL, 10 July, #9, illus. (£1063).

(€37,000 to the Rijksmuseum,  Amsterdam; estimate €3000).  This must be a record price for any  print or group of prints by Barry.  His “Job Reproved” influenced  Blake’s “Job” drawings of the 1780s (Butlin #162-64) and the separate  pl. of 1793 (SP V) based on those drawings.  Early sts. of Barry’s pls. are exceptionally rare.

FUSELI, HENRY
 
Fairy Mab.  Oil, 70.0 x 91.0 cm.,  datable to 1793.  Richard L. Feigen and Co., Frieze Art Fair,  London, 9-14 Oct. (price on request).  See illus. 18.
 
 
18. Henry Fuseli.  Fairy Mab.  Oil, 70.0 x 91.0 cm., datable to 1793.  The design is based on a single line in Milton’s “L’Allegro”: “How Faery Mab  the junkets eat.”  She seems to be enjoying her “junkets”—that is,  sweet delicacies.  The crescent in her elaborate coiffure associates her  with moon goddesses, or at least with the nighttime setting of Milton’s  description.  Weinglass 350 (following Schiff—see below) describes the  figure in the shadows upper right as Mab’s “dwarfish companion the  Brownie.”  No brownie, a benevolent spirit or goblin in Scottish  folklore (see OED),  appears in Milton’s poem, although such a creature may have been  suggested by the “Spicy Nut-brown Ale” consumed by those telling tales  about Mab in “L’Allegro.”  Alternatively, the figure may be a  personification of the ale that inspires faery visions.  Perhaps  Mercutio’s powerfully imaginative description of “Queen Mab” in  Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, act 1, scene 4, influenced  Fuseli’s choice of subject.  An engraving of the design by William  Raddon was published by Ackermann and Co. in 1834 (Weinglass #305). 
Fuseli executed the painting for inclusion as no. 30 in his Milton Gallery.  For studies of this project, see Gert Schiff, Johann Heinrich Füsslis Milton-Galerie (Zurich: Fretz and Wasmuth, 1963), this painting discussed p. 94, and Luisa Calè, Fuseli’s Milton Gallery: “Turning Readers into Spectators” (Oxford: Clarendon P, 2006), this painting not discussed.

(no bids on a  required minimum bid of $3500).  Previously offered as Study for “The Barley Cart,”  EB, Feb. and March-April 2009.  A bit crude; possibly a pastiche  of Linnell’s typical motifs by another artist.  Similar to the  painting by Linnell of the same title sold SL, 26 June 2001, #381,  illus. (£80,500), but with the addition of a windmill upper left.

(no price information, possibly not sold  or withdrawn; estimate £300-500).  The infant may have been related  to Linnell’s friend, the artist David Charles Read (1790-1851).   He never married (see ODNB); I can find no record of Read’s having children.  According to Linnell’s journal, “Mr Blake and Mr Read [were] with me all day” on 8 Sept. 1821 (BR[2]  379).  Read and Blake shared an uncommon means of production: both  etched their own designs and printed them on their own rolling presses.

(£3220), and 12 March 2008, #24, illus. (£5250); offered CSK, 10  Nov. 2011, #83, illus. (not sold; estimate £3000-5000).

19. Attributed to John Linnell.  Shepherd and Sheep in a Landscape.   Oil, 31.0 x 46.0 cm., inscribed on the verso “retouched May 11/77 …  John Linnell Snr.”  This dark, rather overworked painting is not  characteristic of Linnell’s style.  Might this possibly be a rough oil  sketch by Samuel Palmer “retouched” years later by Linnell?  There are  at least some slight similarities between this work and Palmer’s oil and  tempera paintings of the mid-1830s.  Such speculations could account  for the price of £875, on an estimate of £100-200, fetched at BHO on 22  Aug., #51. Some of the white dots in this reproduction, particularly  upper left, are probably reflections from the varnish.

“Life exhal’d in milky fondness”—Becoming a Mother in William Blake’s The Book of Thel
 
By Małgorzata Łuczyńska-Hołdys
 
Małgorzata Łuczyńska-Hołdys (m.holdys@uw.edu.pl)  works as an assistant professor at the Institute of English Studies,  Warsaw University. Her research interests include romantic and Victorian  poetry, images of femininity in literature and art, and Pre-Raphaelite  painting. She has published articles on Blake, Keats, Tennyson, and  Swinburne. Her book Soft-Shed Kisses: Re-visioning the Femme Fatale in English Poetry of the Nineteenth Century awaits publication.
 
 
 
Blake critics most often see The Book of Thel as a thwarted attempt to pass from the state of Innocence to Experience.See Bloom 49, Raine 52, Frye 232-33, Damon 52, 401, Gleckner 163-64, Ankarsjö 62.  Blake’s heroine is usually perceived as a somewhat naive, indecisive  young female afraid to “be born” into the world of adulthood and  maturity, or as a soul that refuses to enter the material world. Hence,  there has been a tendency to pass judgment on Thel’s decision, to  attribute it to weakness, immaturity, or fear, and to see it in  pejorative terms.For example, Gleckner  concludes that Thel is self-centered and sternly pronounces that she has  to learn the life of self-sacrifice (163), while Behrendt asserts that,  for Blake, Thel must have been an example of what he calls “the  dead-end nature of narcissistic behavior” (27). For Matthews, Thel’s  flight means conforming to stereotypes of femininity (100). My  claim is that Thel’s refusal to enter the world of Generation has  nothing to do with relapsing into childhood, or with weakness and  indecisiveness. Instead, I see it as proof of her maturity and  independent spirit. My article is concerned with two problems. Firstly, I want to demonstrate how text and design in The Book of Thel enter a mutual semantic relationship of contradiction and/or redundancy rather than complementarity.For the various types of image-text relations, see A. Kibédi Varga, “Criteria for Describing Word-Image Relations,” Poetics Today 10 (1989): 31-53.  Naturally, this claim is not new; W. J. T. Mitchell recognized this  quality as early as 1978, writing that “the ‘unity’ of an illuminated  book is a dynamic one, built upon the interaction of text and design as  independent or contrary elements” (xviii). What I would like to examine,  however, is how this dynamic interaction reinforces a feminist reading  of Blake’s text. Secondly, although there are critical texts that deal  with Blake’s attitude to women, the majority of Blake scholarship on The Book of Thel  does not seem sufficiently feminist. While he did not manifest an  unwaveringly feminist stance throughout his poetry, in texts such as Thel or Visions of the Daughters of Albion  he dealt with women’s issues in a way that may be deemed progressive.  Consequently, I intend to focus on the problems of motherhood and  childcare as rendered by Blake in his poem, since I perceive these  notions to be essential for our understanding of Thel’s decision. Also,  part of my argument is that, contrary to a number of critical readings,  the message delivered by Thel’s three interlocutors (the Lilly, the  Cloud, and the Clod of Clay) should not be seen as a positive statement  that Blake wanted Thel to accept. Finally, if we comprehend Thel’s  dilemma—whether to become a mother—this can shed light on some actions  taken by other female characters in Blake’s later texts, Oothoon and  Enitharmon in particular.
 
Generally it has been agreed that the issues of gender and sexuality provide a valid interpretative context for The Book of Thel, as “the consequence of the expression of sexual desire is the great theme of Blake’s prophetic poems” (Hayes 144). Thus, David Worrall suggests that The Book of Thel  is Blake’s correction to Swedenborg’s ideas of sexuality: Thel’s escape  “with a shriek” is “a specific refusal of Swedenborg’s doctrine of  conjugal love, a subject topical to contemporary Swedenborgians who were  proposing to establish an African colony based on its principles” (17).Other important texts that discuss Blake’s connections to Swedenborg’s thought are Schuchard’s Why Mrs. Blake Cried, Viscomi’s 1997, 1998, and 1999 essays on The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, and Magnus Ankarsjö, William Blake and Religion (Jefferson: McFarland, 2009). Also, in their introduction to The Book of Thel in The Early Illuminated Books,  Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi note echoes of Swedenborgian thought  (particularly with reference to his doctrine of use) in Blake’s poem  (78). However, as Susan Matthews notices, the vales of Har (the  place that Worrall sees as the realm of Swedenborgian sexual union) are  the world to which, and not from which, Thel flees (100). Matthews, in  turn, sees the flight of Thel at the end of the poem as an escape from  conflict rather than from sexuality, and interprets the vales of Har as a  world where “benefit to the other is benefit to the self” and where,  consequently, the self does not exist (99). Also, for her, the flight  back is not the assertion of the self but a surrender of the self: “At  the end of the poem, Thel flees to a female dream like that of The Triumphs of Temper  which makes sexual desire safe but demands as the price the taking on  of a female identity” (100). In a similar vein, Magnus Ankarsjö, in  Blake and Gender, notices that “although sometimes executing  successful representations of the female, Blake in the early poems is at  pains to find an appropriate expression of the positive interactivity  of man and woman” (3). He locates Thel within the circle of “childlike  innocent characters” (5) and concludes that she “utterly fails and  relapses back to childhood” (62). In the course of this paper, I hope to  demonstrate that it is possible to see Thel’s decision not as a failure  or a surrender of the self, but as an act of self-assertion, a  conscious decision to reject the perspective (however attractive at  times) of both sexual relationship and childbearing. Such a decision is  not a product of an immature, wavering, childlike mind but testifies to  the opposite. Last but not least, it also denotes readiness to face the  conflict that ensues from acting against the expectations of  others. 
 
Modern critical readings recognize the importance of dialogical structure in The Book of Thel.See Levinson and Linkin. Most  of the poem is structured by question-answer exchanges, often  summarized by Thel’s rephrasing of what she has heard. The common  denominator of these conversations is Thel’s inquiry, which is followed  by reassuring statements from other beings already familiar with the  world that she contemplates entering. The chief question, then, is what  it would mean for Thel to enter this world, Blake’s realm of Generation,  or Experience. Entering it may be understood as a conscious decision to  grow up and to assume the social roles prescribed for a woman in the  adult world—primarily the role of mother.
 
Crucially, however, pregnancy and motherhood are preceded by  courtship and marriage. This point has been noted and discussed from  various perspectives by modern critics. Thus, Harriet Kramer Linkin  identifies what frightens Thel off as the sexual nature of human  relationships in the world of Generation. She suggests that Thel’s  “horror at being food for worms actually displaces her deeper fear of  the phallus” and that Thel wilfully chooses to ignore the sexual  implications of the Cloud’s speech, instead focusing on the nurturing  function voiced by the Clod of Clay (69). In the wake of feminist  criticism, Helen Bruder, in an interpretation to which I am deeply  indebted, sees Thel as a poem in which “the sceptical enquiries  of a determined young woman thoroughly unmask patriarchal ideology, an  ideology which promised women that heterosexual romantic and maternal  roles equalled heavenly fulfilment, but which Thel discovers amount to  nothing less than death” (44). Reading the key passage in which the Clod  of Clay appears as mother of the Worm, she concludes that “anyone who  ‘her life exhal’d / In milky fondness’ (Thel, 4:8-9; E.5) has been severely gulled if she believes that this amounts to having ‘a crown that none can take away’ (Thel, 5:4; E.5)” (51).
 
My discussion coincides with the above interpretations in that I also  think the ideology of self-sacrifice, as promoted by the Clod of Clay  and the Lilly, to be the key to understanding Blake’s poem. In addition,  I propose that Thel is actually attracted both to the idea of sexual  union and to the idea of becoming a mother, but she cannot reconcile her  desires with what such fulfillment would mean in a world where the  female is generally given one role, that of a humble servant with no  voice of her own. What frightens Thel off is the philosophy of  utilitarianism and self-denial embodied in the Clod of Clay and, to a  lesser extent, in the Lilly and the Cloud. The Cloud’s conviction that becoming “the food of worms” (3.25, E 5)All quotations of Blake’s poems are from Erdman, Complete Poetry and Prose. might be enough to sing the song of self-fulfillment is another successful deterrent.
 
Thel is an adolescent. Generally, her name has  been interpreted as signifying “wish” or “desire,” but another  meaning has also been suggested—“woman.”Linkin 67n7, relating the suggestion of E. B. Murray. Thus, Thel contemplates what it means to be a woman, and whether it is what she really desires. Her  interest in these questions, as well as her essential ambivalence, is  mirrored in the title-page design (illus. 1), where she observes  intently but with apprehension the passionate embrace of two tiny  creatures emerging from a flowering plant, one male and one female.The plates that I discuss are from The Book of Thel copy H (Library of Congress), William Blake Archive http://www.blakearchive.org. Plates are numbered according to Erdman’s Illuminated Blake.

 Kathleen Raine claims that the designs for Thel “express, even more than those of Songs of Innocence, the easy grace, freedom and expressive sweetness characteristic of Blake’s vision of ‘Innocence’” (52).In a similar vein, Mitchell, in his Blake’s Composite Art, writes that “the title page depicts the courting dance of the Cloud and Dew as a whirling vortex of pleasure” (105).  Is that really so? Unquestionably, we see the characteristic  weightlessness of Blake’s figures and delicate, almost fragile lines,  but the apparent sweetness of the plates is deceptive. Careful  observation reveals darker, more troubling echoes. Thel  seems unsure how to understand the scene she is witnessing: the  passionate embrace of the couple could be an externalization of their  erotic love, but it could also be a scene of entrapment, against which  the female seems to be striving.Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi note the ambiguity of the scene in The Early Illuminated Books (82).  Could the raised arms of the female figure perhaps express her fear of  the union? She is clearly moving away from the naked, plunging body of  her partner. David Erdman, in his Illuminated Blake, gives an account of Erasmus Darwin’s The Loves of the Plants as a possible source of Blake’s illustrations of plants in The Book of Thel. The Loves of the Plants appeared in 1789 as part of The Botanic Garden,  “a poetic guide, in the idiom of ‘The Rape of the Lock,’ to the sexual  behavior of the male and female parts of garden flowers” (33). The plant  that Blake makes the focal point of the title page to Thel is  anemone pulsatilla, a flower that needs the wind to open its petals. As  Erdman recounts, Darwin’s imagery is straightforwardly erotic: the  flower yearns for the wind’s “cherub-lips,” which are then to rend its  “gauzy veil” (34). Ecstasy mixes with aggression and submission. Thel,  standing aside, looks at the scene carefully but with uncertainty. On  the one hand, she is fascinated by the promise of an adult, sexual  relationship; on the other hand, she senses both violence and the power  struggle inherent in such a relationship in the world of Generation.  Thus, her fascination mingles with fear, but the questioning stance very  well reflects her inquisitive attitude toward reality, her inner  compulsion to ask unsettling questions. 
In The Marriage of Heaven and Hell and in his annotations to  Lavater, Blake expresses his conviction that human life should mean an  active search for fulfillment. He claims that it is better to “murder an  infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires” (Marriage 10.67, E 38) and that “all Act [from Individual propensity]  is Virtue” (annotations to Lavater p. 226, E 601). Staying passive, one  becomes like poisonous standing water with “reptiles of the mind” (Marriage 19, E 42), since “he who desires but acts not, breeds pestilence” (Marriage 7.5, E 35). Although it is possible to see Thel as a passive, indecisive figure, since her search is inconclusive,Some  earlier critics seem to ignore Thel’s inquisitiveness, or to attribute  it to a whiny, self-centered attitude; see, for example, Damon 401,  Bloom 53, and Frye 233. this interpretation overlooks the fact  that, unlike all the other characters in the poem, she exhibits a  pondering, questioning attitude. The Lilly and the Clod exult in their  productive, selfless lives. Thel’s sisters have also become  characterized by the duties that they fulfill: as shepherdesses, they  obediently “led round their sunny flocks” (1.1, E 3), even if, as Bruder  suggests, they run in circles (44-45). If they have desires, they do  their best to suppress them. In contrast, Thel actively searches for  fulfillment and ponders what this fulfillment implies and whether it  would cost her dear. Her resistance is much more active than her  compliance could ever be.
 
Thel, as the reader meets her for the first time, is deeply worried,  and she feels alienated in her anxieties, brooding over them “in  paleness” and in secrecy (1.2, E 3). In this way Blake stresses her  position as an outsider, which she occupies at the beginning and retains  to the end of the book. Although she inhabits the vales of Har, which  have been traditionally interpreted as a paradise-like world (Blake’s  Beulah or preexistence), and thus is not subject to death, Thel in her  first lamentation is concerned with mutability. She compares herself to  all beautiful but transient phenomena in the material world, such as “a  watry bow,” “a parting cloud,” “a reflection in a glass,” “dreams of  infants,” “shadows in the water,” “music in the air” (1.8-11, E 3). The  Lilly of the Valley, the first of Thel’s interlocutors, is puzzled by  her worries, and asks “then why should Thel complain, / Why should the  mistress of the vales of Har, utter a sigh” (1.25, 2.1, E 4)? Despite  being a daughter of the Seraphim, Thel stubbornly refuses to see herself  as immortal. While this point may be explained by noting that  transience is the chief feature of the world that Thel contemplates  entering—the cause of her fears—such an interpretation soon proves  elusive: all the creatures that she talks to proclaim the existence of  an afterlife, and the Clod of Clay, inviting Thel into her kingdom,  assures her that “’tis given thee to enter, / And to return” (5.16-17, E  6). Though Thel need not fear disintegration in death, she is not  comforted by any of the speeches and continues to cast herself as a  transient, mutable being, different from those she meets on her way. As  James Swearingen perceptively notes, “Her unity with the life of the  fabulous setting is already disrupted. That unity does not belong to the  time of the poem; it is a narrative memory, a hypothetical condition  ‘before’ her differentiation from other things living alongside her in  the vales of Har” (128). Gradually, however, she turns to contemplating a  purpose rather than the transience of her existence. Very quickly she  concludes that there is no aim, no use in her life. She claims that she  wants to leave a trace of her existence instead of disappearing without a  mark. Thus, it may be suggested that death for Thel is nothing but  insignificance. The main problem, however, around which the rest of the  text is structured, is how to signify without having one’s identity  totally obliterated. 
 
The Lilly of the Valley is Thel’s opposite. She describes herself in  terms of modesty, humility, hard work, and cheerfulness. She is “very  small” and dwells in “lowly vales” (1.17, E 4); she is a weak and gentle  maid who does not talk too much, only bows “her modest head” (2.17, E  4) and resides in “modest brooks” and “silent valleys” (1.22, E 4),  where she goes to “mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass”  (2.18, E 4). Her description adheres to the doctrine of self-sacrifice  that underlies Thel. Morris Eaves, Robert Essick, and Joseph  Viscomi attribute this ideology to “contemporary handbooks for young  ladies that taught the docile acceptance of servitude to masculine  desires and expectations” (The Early Illuminated Books 80), and  this seems to be the case with the Lilly. She believes that her  behavior is bound to be rewarded: she will be “clothed in light” and  “fed with morning manna” (1.23, E 4). She feels gratefulness toward him  “that smiles on all” (1.19, E 4) (critics still debate whether he is God  from Eden or just a male cloud). Regardless of the ambiguity, this  presence is unquestionably male and his behavior, as well as the Lilly’s  humble and grateful response from her position of dependency, defines  her world as patriarchal. Since, in the Lilly’s perception, her  existence amounts to a happy and fulfilled life, she cannot understand  Thel’s doubts and worries. Why should Thel complain, if, upon entering  the adult social world, she will be rewarded in exactly the same way for  exactly the same behavior? She previews Dante  Gabriel Rossetti’s  “an angel-watered lily” (the ideal female) from  the sonnets written to accompany the painting The Girlhood of Mary Virgin,Rossetti  wrote two sonnets to accompany his painting; their collective title is  “Mary’s Girlhood (For a Picture),” and they are numbered I and II. The  quotations come from the first sonnet (see the poem in the Rossetti Archive http://​www.​rossettiarchive.​org).  a lily that “near God / Grows and is quiet” (lines 10-11). Rossetti  characterizes Mary (the lily) by “simplicity of intellect, / And supreme  patience” (lines 5-6), while her virtues correspond to the books that  she studies: hope, faith, and charity. The Lilly, as her name suggests,  signifies purity, virginity, and innocence, but it is interesting to  remember that lilies have another primary symbolic association: death.  This makes Blake’s symbolism extraordinarily consistent, and links the  Lilly to other elements in the text associated with death and mourning:  the Clod of Clay, tombs, worms, withering of the body, and elegiac  overtones. Would existence akin to that of the Lilly mean death for  Thel? Strikingly, though,  Thel sees the Lilly as the essence of  motherhood and maternal care. 
 
We may recall here an interesting biographical speculation offered by S. Foster Damon, who suggests that The Book of Thel  might have been an elegy written by Blake on the death of his daughter,  lost through miscarriage (401), though no biographers support this  conjecture. Certainly, the theme of motherhood is one of the chief  concerns in Blake’s poem. What is the vision of motherhood endorsed by  the text, then, and how does it clash with what Thel would like it to  be? The answer is partly revealed in the first dialogic exchange, with  the Lilly of the Valley, and implicated in all subsequent interactions  that Thel initiates.
 
When Thel rephrases the Lilly’s answer, she arrives at her own  interpretation of the Lilly’s life. She describes her in terms of  servitude and meekness, which become synonymous with nursing and  mothering: the Lilly, Thel says, nourishes the innocent lamb, feeds him,  cleans him, cherishes him. What is more, the Lilly is characterized by  her “milky garments” (2.5, E 4), which straightforwardly figure  breastfeeding and foreshadow the Clod’s “milky fondness” (4.9, E 5).  Finally, she calmly accepts the prospect of her sacrifice: while the  lamb devours her flowers she sits “smiling in his face” (2.6, E 4). The  Lilly also attends to other living creatures: her perfume “revives the  milked cow” and “tames the fire-breathing steed” (2.10, E 4). The  question implied in this passage, therefore, concerns the extent to  which selfless giving may be reconciled with one’s own needs. What is  left of the Lilly when her flowers are cropped, her leaves become the  bed for worms, and her perfume is scattered all over the grass?
 
At the end of this encounter, Thel reasserts her difference from the  Lilly, but it seems that her emotional response to the Lilly’s speech is  not negative at all. As she contemplates the possibility of becoming a  mother, she looks at the Lilly with interest and only slight  apprehension. Thel’s own vision of nursing and care appears to have  diverted her attention from the real meaning of the Lilly’s speech,  which represents an essentially submissive position of humble  dependence. Her positive attitude toward the Lilly (or her refashioning  of the Lilly’s function) can be detected when she contrasts her own  futility with the Lilly’s existence. Thel imagines herself now as a  “faint cloud” (2.11, E 4) that experiences mutability and does not leave  a trace when it vanishes from its “pearly throne” (2.12, E 4). 
 
As if by the touch of a magic wand, the personified—distinctly  male—Cloud appears. While the Cloud seems to answer Thel’s worries  connected with mutability, stressing the life cycles in nature, he  primarily embodies the principle of sexual love. The fact that Thel sees  him as attractive is figured in her description of him as a  “bright form” with a “golden head” (3.5, E 4), shiny and glittering.  Erdman notes the tones of “sexual encounter and aggressive masculinity”  in The Book of Thel, which he attributes to Darwin’s The Botanic Garden (The Illuminated Blake  33). Similarly, Bruder concludes that the Cloud’s speech is suggestive  of violent appropriation: he, the only male in the text, violates the  fair-eyed dew, who cries and trembles, afraid of their union (48). Such a  reading, however, is not wholly convincing: after all, the Cloud is  said to court the dew (courtship connotes gentle and tender behavior),  which results in his being invited to the dew’s shining tent. Thus, the  sexual union that ensues is both feared and wanted by the “fair eyed  dew” (3.13, E 5), and it happens with, rather than without, her consent.  The dew, in her virginity, simultaneously desires and is afraid of  sexual fulfillment. Hence, the Cloud is undeniably masculine and  decisive, but not necessarily violent and aggressively appropriative.
 
Thel’s attraction to the idea of partnership and sexual union is  clearly spelled out in the illustration accompanying plate 4 (illus. 2).

 The design serves as a visual bridge between plates 3 and 4. While the  text of plate 3 consists of the Cloud’s speech, there is no visual  equivalent of this scene on the plate. As I suggested earlier, I believe  that some designs to The Book of Thel contradict, rather than  complement, the text, and I see plates 3 and 4 as examples of this  contradiction. There is nothing in the text of plate 3 to suggest that  Thel has been convinced by the Cloud’s speech, which explains how a  female can find meaning in the world of Generation. The text depicts the  moment that Thel finds hard to accept when the Cloud defines the proper  place and significance for her in such terms: 
Then if thou art the food of worms. O virgin of the skies, How great thy use. how great thy blessing; every thing that lives, Lives not alone, nor for itself. (3.25-27, E 5)
 Laura Quinney notices the contradiction between Thel’s expectations and  the ultimate message communicated to her by the Cloud, and reads this  statement as ironic: 
It would be a mistake to think that Blake endorses this  idea. The Cloud goes on to explain, “everything that lives, / Lives not  alone, nor for itself” (Thel 3:26-27, E5), but this assertion is not to  be confused with Blake’s “Everything that lives is Holy” (MHH  25, E45; my italics). In the Cloud’s absurd suggestion, Blake is mocking  the attempt to redeem strictly natural existence. Consciousness cannot  be content with its fate because the body nurtures worms. (32)
 The conflict between Thel’s aspirations and the Cloud’s ideology is  straightforwardly indicated when she complains in the previous lines 
And all shall say, without a use this shining woman liv’d, Or did she only live. to be at death the food of worms. (3.22-23, E 5)
 This exchange testifies to the crucial misunderstanding: for Thel,  feeding the worms is the ultimate sign of nothingness and  insignificance, while her interlocutor understands it as the essence of  both use and significance. Despite the obvious conflict of attitudes and  expectations, Blake chooses to portray Thel with open,  outstretched arms prior to the moment in the text where this openness is  indicated. Her verbal acceptance is delayed until after her  conversation with the Clod of Clay in plate 5. Yet, in the design to  plate 4, Thel is open and inviting; the apprehension signaled by her  wary, cautious position as an outsider in the title plate has vanished.  The explanation of this contradiction must be seen in her response to  the appearance of the Cloud and the account of his sexual, impregnating  function, rather than to his words about feeding the worms after death,  which, as we have seen, clash acutely with Thel’s expectations. As yet,  Thel overlooks the connection between motherhood and such a sacrifice:  after all, she herself described the Lilly of the Valley as being  devoured by the lamb, but at that moment she seemed to praise the Lilly  for her nurturing stance. 
Blake depicts the Cloud in the design to plate 4, later than his  appearance in the text, on the plate that simultaneously shows Thel’s  encounter with the Worm. This device can be seen as an example of what  Mitchell calls “the technique of syncopation” and defines as placing  designs “at a physical and metaphoric distance from their best textual  reference” (193). A naked male figure flies with his arms outstretched  in the upper part of the design, while in the lower part we see Thel  standing above a little worm-like infant “wrapped in the Lillys leaf”  (4.3, E 5). Blake’s decision to depict both encounters within one design  suggests that the intention was to stress the inevitable relationship  between sexuality and birth. If Thel decides to be a mother, first she  has to accept her role as a sexual partner. Thel looks at the Worm with  arms ready to embrace. Strikingly, plate 4 shows one of the few moments  in the designs to Thel where she stands as if inviting, or actively wanting to embrace, the new experience.  In  Blake’s designs, human postures are always suggestive of mental or  spiritual conditions, and, as a number of critics have demonstrated,  leaping, open, dancing figures with outstretched arms are often  contrasted with bound, bent, constricted and confined, closed postures.For  discussion of similar human figures and their postures, see Warner.  Raine states straightforwardly: “There are, for Blake’s human figures,  essentially two conditions—the unconfined freedom of unimpeded energy;  and the constricted, fettered, weighted and cramped state of the  prisoners of Urizen’s universe of mechanized nature” (111).
 
Thel’s gesture is an exact parallel of the Cloud’s outstretched arms.  Wanting to hold the baby, she accepts her sexuality as well and, like  “fair eyed dew,” invites erotic union. Thus, my reading contradicts the  view that Thel “is especially unresponsive to potentialities that she is  unwilling to acknowledge in herself, most obviously her sexuality. Her  interest assumes the form of a safe maternal superiority and attends to  the Worm only as mediated by the Clod of Clay” (Swearingen 133). I  believe that Thel consciously seeks the articulation of her feminine  desire (as suggested by the possibilities of meaning inherent in her  name), which embraces both sexual partnership and maternal love.  However, she becomes discouraged and frightened by the implications  accompanying this prospect mediated to her by other presences in the  text (most crucially, the Clod of Clay) and seen during her thwarted  attempt to enter Generation.
 
This discouragement is represented in the design to plate 5 (illus.  3), where Thel is sitting under a threatening plant, her posture the  reverse of what it was in plate 4.

 Erdman identifies this plant as Meadia or dodecatheon, which “extends  one blushing blossom above her [Thel’s] head, still closed (compare the  bud thrusting near in Plate ii) but beginning to put forth long stamens  (a strongly phallic assertion in the Darwinian context)” (The Illuminated Blake 39). Thel’s whole body communicates defensiveness. Embracing herself, she wants only to be left alone. This gesture is a frequent indicator of despair and dejection in Blake’s designs.Compare the design for The First Book of Urizen pl. 7, where Los “howld in a dismal stupor” (7.1, E 74), as well as the figure of Theotormon embracing himself in Visions of the Daughters of Albion pl. i.  At Thel’s feet Blake depicts a mother playing with a child (a  personified vision of the Clod and the Worm), but now Thel rejects even  the experience that so far was attractive to her. Her bowed head  obscures her face and suggests that she does not want to observe the  joyful play. The flowers and plants in this plate are either predatory  (on the right) or withered (on the left) and powerfully communicate  Thel’s inner state: threatened, she mourns her withered hopes. Behind  her we see a gloomy, dark cloud. The price to pay for fulfillment as a  lover and a mother, after all, turned out to be too high. 
Plate 5 is another example of the contradiction between design and  text. Blake devotes two plates of text to Thel’s encounter with the Worm  and the Clod of Clay, but while plate 4 describes Thel’s essentially  positive vision of the Worm as a child and the emergence of the mother  figure, the Clod of Clay, plate 5 stresses aspects of feminine roles in  the world of Generation that Thel rejects. The decision to separate,  through the division between plates, these two verbal exchanges supports  the claim that it is not the experience of motherhood that Thel rejects  as such, but the way in which this experience is mediated to her  through the figure of the Clod, who is a sum of the attitudes of female  servitude and submissiveness and who, even more importantly, harbors the  opinion of her own unworthiness and insignificance as a person  outside her role as a mother. Thus, in plate 4, the meeting with the  Worm results in a spontaneous overflow of maternal feelings on Thel’s  part: she sees the Worm as helpless, naked, weak, and crying, and pities  it for its loneliness. In a way testifying to her lack of practice, she  tries to comfort it, urging it not to weep (4.4, E 5). At this moment  the Clod of Clay materializes and appears to Thel as pitying, humble,  and caring. Blake connects her to Thel’s earlier perception of the  Lilly’s milky garments: the image of the Clod’s nursing the Worm results  in “her life exhal’d / In milky fondness” (4.8-9, E 5). This striking  image communicates the essence of motherhood: on the one hand,  selflessness on the verge of self-sacrifice when, breastfeeding a baby,  the woman gives the best part of herself to her child; on the other  hand, “milky fondness,” which suggests love and willingness to do so. It  is not a grudging, calculating, resentful giving, but a true gift of  the heart as well as of the body. This is the vision to which Thel is  drawn, as we see her in plate 4, where she is standing with open arms  full of love and tenderness.
 
Toward the end of plate 4, however, complications emerge. The Clod of Clay proceeds to inform Thel of her own unworthiness: 

Thou seest me the meanest thing, and so I am indeed; My bosom of itself is cold. and of itself is dark. (4.11-12, E 5)
 In short, alone and by herself, she believes that she is nothing. She  needs a man (God?) to give her significance and a function to uplift her  status through marriage and childbirth, and this is how plate 5 starts: 
But he that loves the lowly, pours his oil upon my head. And kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my breast. And says; Thou mother of my children, I have loved thee. And I have given thee a crown that none can take away. (5.1-4, E 5-6)
 Although she finds erotic and maternal love alluring, Thel has no  inclination to accept it as her only purpose of existence and her duty.  She wants to see it as her active choice that would be appreciated and  met with thankfulness, not as something that she needs to be thankful  for. Her maternal instincts to cherish and hold are alive and well,  which is also true of her desire for partnership and marital union.  Nevertheless, Thel’s intellect rebels at the Clod’s message asserting  her meaninglessness, her internal conviction that she of herself is  dark, mean, and cold and is given meaning only by being impregnated. She  does not want to accept the attitude indicated in the Clod’s humble “I  ponder, and I cannot ponder; yet I live and love” (5.6, E 6). This is  the probable reason for Thel’s unresponsiveness, shown in the design. 
Interestingly, this is a moment where the design and the text  evidently clash again. In the text, Thel’s response to the words of the  Clod suggests welcoming and willing reception: she wipes her tears and  proclaims her readiness to enter Generation after all. The explanation  of the shift in her stance, nevertheless, is peculiar: Thel rephrases  the Clod’s speech but, as happened earlier in the conversation with the  Lilly, it seems that she has heard a message different from the one  understood by the reader. Has she even been listening to what the Clod  said? Thel states: 

Alas! I knew not this, and therefore did I weep: That God would love a Worm I knew, and punish the evil foot That wilful, bruis’d its helpless form: but that he cherish’d it With milk and oil, I never knew; and therefore did I weep. (5.8-11, E 6)
 When Thel was listening to the Lilly, she screened out the meaning of  her words: instead of the Lilly’s proclamation of her smallness,  humbleness, modesty, humility, and insignificance, Thel noticed only her  nurturing, giving, open attitude. Now, summarizing what the Clod said,  she concentrates on the notion that God cherishes every living creature  (the Clod never said that!) and, consequently, she convinces herself to  seek fulfillment in the world of adulthood and maturity. She does not,  at that point, consciously notice the ideology endorsed by the Clod  because the Clod talks about what Thel desires: love, marital union, and  childbearing. The vision of partnership and maternity is so tempting  that Thel overlooks graver implications in her words. It is as if the  Thel of the text is more naive and more easily deluded than the Thel of  the designs. No wonder that when she finally enters Generation and sees  with her own eyes the world whose patriarchal rules the Lilly, the  Cloud, and the Clod of Clay described, she turns from it in revulsion,  and, shrieking, flies back into the vales of Har. 
The design accompanying the last plate of The Book of Thel (illus. 4) is an example of a verbal-visual relationship known as redundancy. While  so far we have encountered one-to-one correspondence, by which every  design has its equivalent in a passage of the text, the last design  stands apart.The tendency to accompany  text with designs that seem not to illustrate it is prominent in other  prophetic books, and the designs for The First Book of Urizen may serve as an example (see pls. 15 and 27). Within The Book of Thel  pl. 1 is similar to a certain extent, but in comparison with the last  plate it is still easier to find parallels with the text; Erdman  suggests that “both the eagle man and the armed man adumbrate the  ‘fighting men in ambush’ that haunt Thel in Plate 6” (The Illuminated Blake 35).  Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi call this plate “less an illustration to the  text than a visual commentary on it or a final vision providing an  alternative ending to Thel” (The Early Illuminated Books 85).

 Blake presents a striking image of two young children and an adolescent  girl riding a snake in a way suggestive of both joy inherent in the  activity and control exerted over the creature. The children play on the  loops of the serpent; the girl, in a red dress in this copy, firmly  holds the reins in her hand. Some critics do not identify the girl with Thel.Neither  Erdman nor Damon identifies the girl with Thel. Damon sees “a girl,  with a light bridle” guiding “the Serpent of Nature” (52), while Erdman  decisively states that the girl is not Thel and contrasts her “easy  riding of the phallic serpent” with Thel’s shriek (The Illuminated Blake 40).  Others, like Anne Mellor, see the design as a triumphant symbol of  Thel’s overcoming her fears,  suggesting that it is “an emblem of  the ability of Innocence to bridle or control the evils of the land of  death, … and to reaffirm the wisdom of Innocence” (36), which will  enable Thel later to “joyfully lead round her ‘sunny flocks,’ secure and  lovingly productive in the mutable but holy world of Innocence” (37).  The second part of Mellor’s statement is problematic. In my view, Thel  is present in the design and she is triumphant, but her rite of passage  has been precisely to recognize the fact that she does not want to be  “lovingly productive” and to “joyfully lead … her ‘sunny flocks,’” at  least not round and round, as her sisters do in plate 1. I think,  rather, that this design is indicative of Thel’s inner transformation:  instead of female malleability and perfect compliance with the roles  that have been written for her, she takes the reins of control into her  own hands and writes her role herself. I see this design as the most  optimistic, as it implies maturity and decisiveness on Thel’s part, but  does not exclude joy and fulfillment (as suggested by the presence of  the playing children). It appears that Thel has finally found a way out  of her dilemma and a life in which her worth does not entirely depend on  how good she is at serving and self-denial, a life of which we see only  a glimpse and which is not narrated in her book. The change of color of  her dress in this copy, from white to dark pink, signifies that the  rite of passage has been completed. 
Two poems from Songs of Innocence and of Experience that  also deal with maternal love and childbearing throw additional light on  Thel’s dilemma concerning fulfillment. The connections occur both on the  visual and on the textual level in ways too striking to ignore. “Infant  Joy” and “Infant Sorrow” delineate contrasting visions of childhood and  of parenthood. Since the parents’ attitude to their  parenthood—happiness or dejection—defines and determines the joy or  sorrow of their children, the poems speak as much about the emotions of  the children as of the adults.

 “Infant Joy” (illus. 5) is visually linked to The Book of Thel  through the plant image that forms the center of the design. The same  flower (anemone pulsatilla), although with different leaves, is used in  the title page of The Book of Thel (illus. 1).  Erdman discerns this similarity and goes on to ask: “And we might  wonder how Thel would regard the bud (which gets in her way in Thel ii) if she could see the present scene in the open blossom?” (The Illuminated Blake  66). The anemone in the design has leaves and a stem strongly  reminiscent of flames, and its blossom is also flame-like. Inside the  flower Blake depicts three human figures: a mother with a child on her  knees and a winged female angel. The poem enacts happiness and unity  both verbally and visually: the stems and the leaves enclose the text  and culminate in the cup- or womb-like blossom in the upper part of the  design, which delicately and safely shelters the nativity scene inside. The  position of the mother, tenderly bent over her child, as well as the  presence of an angel, recalls representations of the Madonna and Christ,  in accordance with one of the main motifs of Songs of Innocence, where Jesus is said to be identical with every living being, a child in particular.This motif recurs in Songs of Innocence: it can be found in “The Lamb,” “The Divine Image,” “On Anothers Sorrow,” and “A Cradle Song.”  The dialogue that governs the poem testifies to the harmonious  interaction between the mother and the child. The mother’s question  “What shall I call thee?” (line 3, E 16) signals receptivity and respect  toward her newborn child. As a result, sweet joy befalls both of them,  becoming the child’s name and the mother’s inner state. 
The womb-like shape of the flower and the flame and color symbolism  (the flower in copy C is dark pink, almost purple) suggest the  possibility that the scene inside the flower imaginatively renders the  situation prior to the birth, and that the two-day-old child has only  just been conceived. In this reading, more than ever before, the notion  of a passionate erotic relationship stands in the background. The child  is the mother’s joy because it is the fruit of her erotic union with a  man she loves. She may shelter her baby inside her womb and sing joyful  lullabies because she herself feels happy and protected inside her  relationship. Although no masculine element is literally present in the  poem or in the picture, the presence of the father/partner figure is  indicated both through the conception of the child and through the unity  and happiness enacted in the design.

In contrast, “Infant Sorrow” projects a diametrically different  scene. The loving dialogue between the mother and the child of “Infant  Joy” is replaced by the woeful monologue of the newborn, who “leap[s]”  (E 28) into the dangerous world, where nobody is happy about its birth:  the parents, crying and groaning, give in to dejection and depression.  The child becomes a devil (a “fiend”), not a joy; it enters a world  defined by struggle, aggression, and limitation; it struggles in the  father’s hands and against the swaddling bands, which constrain it and  make any free movement impossible. Exhausted by the conflict, the child  gives up and agrees to suck its mother’s milk, but there is no “milky  fondness,” no happy giving and taking: instead, the breastfed child is  said to “sulk” upon the mother’s breast. Clearly, there is no joy in  their mutual relationship, only the baby’s needy hunger and the mother’s  sense of duty and resignation. As John Bender and Anne Mellor suggest, 
Here, the child of innocent energy at first struggles  against the chains of society and authority. But finally it capitulates,  persuaded by developing reason that survival lies in accommodating  oneself to the powers that be—even though such capitulation can only  produce a life of frustration. The child is fed, but at the price of  being swaddled and of “sulking.” (301)
 Their reading of “Infant Sorrow” is primarily aimed at showing that  there is a visual/verbal discrepancy between the design and the text,  undermining the governing concept of the “Sister Arts” (298). The main  disjunction, as this interpretation suggests, is between the newborn  baby in the poem, swaddled and oppressed, and the  one-and-a-half-year-old child in the design (304-05). Another divergence  can be detected in the mother figure, who “leans forward in a  pliant arc” with a “soft, tenderly beckoning … gesture” toward her child  (304). While the absence of the swaddling bands and the different age  of the child are unmistakable, the gesture code that Blake uses in this  design seems to echo the title page of The Book of Thel, where  the couple emerging from the flower are presented in a similar way—one  of the lovers with hands uplifted in a gesture of alarm, the other  struggling to grasp and embrace her. It may be concluded, then, that the  design for “Infant Sorrow” retains ambiguity similar to that in the  title page for Thel. The child reaches away from the mother,  communicating an ambivalent attitude toward her embrace, which may be  perceived as tender or as restricting. Feeling helpless and naked,  “piping loud” as in the poem, the child finally has no choice, however,  but to succumb to the mother’s grasp. 
It is worth remembering that Thel, upon meeting the infant-Worm,  describes the baby in almost identical terms: “helpless,” “naked,” and  “weeping.” Her dilemma can be summarized in the clashing visions of  motherhood depicted in “Infant Joy” and “Infant Sorrow.” Thel yearns for  fulfillment as a mother and as a partner similar to that indicated in  “Infant Joy,” but does not think that such a vision is plausible in the  world described by her interlocutors. Convinced that in the world of  Generation motherhood would realize itself as metaphorically presented  in “Infant Sorrow,” she visualizes herself as an oppressed and unhappy  mother, who would impose the same pattern of oppression on her baby.  Since she does not want to become the groaning, grasping figure of  “Infant Sorrow,” Thel rejects the prospect of erotic love and motherhood  outright, at least for the time being. Her choice is deeply embedded in  the question of gender difference in a patriarchal world, presided over  by a male God who legitimizes the purpose of one’s existence by giving  meaning to that which “of itself is cold. and of itself is dark” (Thel  4.12, E 5), where a female has no right to assert her worth if she does  not fulfill her biological function of childbearing. Instead, Thel  desires existence in a world where being a mother does not mean solely  becoming food for worms, where she is allowed to think and ask  questions, making her own free choices, and where she may expect  gratitude for all that she has to offer.
 
Considering the fate of female figures in Blake’s later texts, one  may feel that Thel’s decision is quite appropriate. Blake presents no  vision of happy motherhood, and any prospect of a successful  relationship comes at a high price. If we look at The Book of Thel  from a feminist viewpoint, this can put other female characters in  Blake’s poetry into a new perspective. Thus, we have brave, adventurous  Oothoon in Visions of the Daughters of Albion, who is first  cruelly mistreated and then severely punished for both her openness and  her loving nature. Not only is she branded a whore, but she is also made  to abort her own child as a result of social pressure. Why does she  decide to perform the abortion? Her urge to “purify” herself in order to  “deserve” Theotormon is one of her motives, but it is equally likely  that she cannot face the possibility of becoming an outcast, unwed,  single mother, nor does she want to be “stampt with my [Bromion’s]  signet” (Visions 1.21, E 46). In other prophetic books we have Enitharmon, who in The First Book of Urizen  flees from Los’s embrace but is probably forced into sexual union with  him, which results in her (unwanted?) pregnancy. The outcome is a  lifelong struggle for domination, since Enitharmon is not a docile  character either, but consequently her life is far from happy. She is  another unfortunate mother in Blake’s poems—together with her child she  becomes a victim of Los’s (the father’s) jealousy. Orc is just as  unhappy as the child from “Infant Sorrow”: he is born howling and his  birth is accompanied by shrieks from all Eternity. Finally, he is bound  to the rock at the top of the mountain and left there without any  protection (Urizen 19-20, E 79-80).
 
Both Oothoon and Enitharmon enact Thel’s dilemma regarding the  acceptance of the position of a woman in a patriarchal world. They  plausibly present what might have happened to Thel had she decided to  enter Generation after all. Oothoon rebels, but succeeds only in  verbally asserting her position, as the poem ends in stagnation.  Enitharmon, in turn, is a very ambivalent figure. Married to Los in  “discontent and scorn” (The Four Zoas 13.19, E 308), she  lives out her stormy relationship with her partner and generally fights  for independence but ends up with what we may call militant feminism:  she establishes the “Womans World” till her creative capacities become  perverted and she weaves the “triple Female Tabernacle for Moral Law,”  “That he who loves Jesus may loathe terrified Female love / Till God  himself become a Male subservient to the Female” (Jerusalem  88.16-21, E 247). Instead of harmonious, mutually supportive  relationships and love we mostly have power struggles. Sadly, it seems  that there are no positive patterns in Blake’s later poetry to follow  regarding female fulfillment either as an independent woman or in  relation to others. The best that can happen to females such as Ololon  and Jerusalem is their total absorption into their male counterpart,  even if the outcome of this process is deemed glorious and ultimately  positive. No wonder that this has provoked various statements about  Blake’s anti-feminist stance; Diane Hoeveler claims that “Blake clearly  depicts androgyny as a male-centered ideal that exists only through the  predatory usurpation of the female. Unless the  female willingly sacrifices her existence to the male, he remains a  spectre, a shadow of his unfallen potential,” and that there is in  Blake’s poetry “a persistent womb-envy of women as creators,  life-givers, mothers” (42-43).However,  this comment relates to what Hoeveler terms an “early notion of the  female as an unequal principle”; according to Hoeveler, later Blake  turned to viewing women “as equals in recapturing the androgynous ideal”  (43). Yet it would be a mistake to reduce Blake’s thought to  everyday categories of gender only. Ultimately, “male” and “female” are  for him cosmic categories, the forces constituting the essence of  humanity and the divine Poetic Genius, and this goes way beyond any  domestic relevance of masculinity and femininity. Since Blake  believes that the division into sexes is in fact one of the stages of  the fall from the ideal order prior to the creation of the natural  world, he also points out that “The Sexual is Threefold: the Human is  Fourfold” (Milton 4.5, E 97). When, at the end of Milton, he speaks of those 

Who pretend to Poetry that they may destroy Imagination; By imitation of Natures Images drawn from Remembrance These are the Sexual Garments, the Abomination of Desolation Hiding the Human Lineaments as with an Ark and Curtains Which Jesus rent: and now shall wholly purge away with Fire Till Generation is swallowd up in Regeneration (Milton 41[48].23-28, E 142-43)
 he figures the sexual garments (it’s irrelevant whether they are male or  female) as hiding the true essence that lies within. Ultimately,  “Humanity is far above / Sexual organization” (Jerusalem 79.73-74, E 236). 
Bearing in mind the clearly positive and sympathetic attitudes to what we can term female dissent in both The Book of Thel and Visions of the Daughters of Albion,  we can conclude that some of Blake’s texts openly voice feminist  concerns and yield well to feminist readings. Blake displays acute  sensitivity to and awareness of women’s issues, unprecedented among  other so-called canonical romantic poets. First and foremost, he gives  his female characters the right of choice—whether to enter a sexual  relationship and to give birth to a child (Thel), whether openly to  display her readiness for erotic union and to deny ideology that  condemns her to ostracism (Oothoon)—even if he does not present  constructive alternatives to the most socially expected choices. This is  undoubtedly progressive when we realistically consider the situation of  women at the end of the eighteenth century. Secondly, and crucially,  Blake always finds a way to speak from the inside rather than from the  outside of a dramatic situation that he constructs, which results in a  non-judgmental stance and multiplies possible interpretations. This  strategy makes him more akin to Keats’s “chameleon poet” or even  Rossetti’s “inner standing point” than to Wordsworth’s egotistical  sublime or Byron’s very personal manner of narration. In The Book of Thel and Visions of the Daughters of Albion,  the “inner standing point” that Blake assumes is the perspective of the  oppressed, internally conflicted, and pained woman. His sympathetic  attitude is a result of his extraordinary psychological insights into  the human psyche and human relationships, which pervade his poetry from  the very early texts. His interest in the  individual mind and its internal conflicts and contradictions finds its  crowning manifestation in his major conception of the four Zoas, which  is as psychological as it is mythopoeic, but already in such texts as The Book of Thel, Visions of the Daughters of Albion, and Songs of Innocence and of Experience Blake shows how perceptive and progressive his awareness of “mind-forg’d manacles” is.It  is hardly surprising, therefore, that there are a number of studies  tracing parallels between Blake’s thought and ground-breaking  psychological theories. See Jerry Caris Godard, Mental Forms Creating: William Blake Anticipates Freud, Jung, and Rank (Lanham: University Press of America, 1985), Diana Hume George, Blake and Freud (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1980), and Dóra Janzer Csikós, “Four Mighty Ones are in Every Man”: The Development of the Fourfold in Blake (Budapest: Akadémiai Kiadó, 2003).

“another, but far more amiable enthusiast”: References to Catherine and William Blake in the Literary Gazette and La Belle Assemblée (1830)
 
By Angus Whitehead
 
Angus Whitehead (whitehead65_99@yahoo.co.uk)  is an assistant professor in literature in English at the National  Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University. He has  published a number of papers on Blake, most recently “‘an excellent  saleswoman’: The Last Years of Catherine Blake” (Blake) and is  coeditor (with Mark Crosby and Troy Patenaude) of a collection of essays  exploring a range of new critical approaches to William Blake, Re-envisioning Blake  (2012). Angus is currently completing a book-length microbiographical  study of William and Catherine Blake’s residence at 17 South Molton  Street. He has also published a number of papers, reviews, and  interviews related to writing in Singapore, and is currently editing  collections of short stories by Arthur Yap and local trade unionist and  journalist Gregory Nalpon (1938-78), the latter to be published in  August 2013.
 
 
 
In Blake Records, G. E. Bentley, Jr., My  thanks to Keri Davies for reading an earlier draft of this paper and  for his suggestions concerning Blake and women’s fashion.observes that “the publication of Cunningham’s life of Blake provoked a spate of comment upon Blake in the spring of 1830.”G. E. Bentley, Jr., Blake Records, 2nd ed. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) [hereafter BR(2)] 503. Bentley records six traced reviews of Allan Cunningham’s The Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, vol. 2 (1830), that appeared in the first quarter of 1830.See BR(2)  503-10. A quotation from Cunningham’s life of Blake about the  poet-artist’s visions of William Wallace and Edward I appeared in the Times on 27 Jan. 1830 (see Angus Whitehead, “‘Visions of Blake, the Artist’: An Early Reference to William Blake in the Times,” Blake 41.1 [summer 2007]: 46-47). The same passage was printed in the Rural Repository; or, Bower of Literature (17 July 1830): 30-31.  This note first discusses a reader’s query, in all probability written  in response to one of these reviews, concerning the whereabouts of  Catherine Blake, then goes on to record another review of volume 2 of  Cunningham’s Lives, which makes several new references to William Blake.
 
I
 
Previously I have suggested that the numerous notices and reviews of  Cunningham’s work, besides bringing Blake to a wider audience, may have alerted readers to the plight of his widow.Mark  Crosby and Angus Whitehead, “Georgian Superwoman or ‘the maddest of the  two’? Recovering the Historical Catherine Blake, 1762-1831,” Re-envisioning Blake, ed. Mark Crosby, Troy Patenaude, and Angus Whitehead (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012) 105.  Such publicity perhaps helped Catherine Blake to sell her husband’s  works and thereby support herself independently. Over a year earlier,  shortly after publication of J. T. Smith’s Nollekens and His Times, which features a biography of Blake, the  book illustrator, antiquary, and barrister William Twopenny wrote to  Smith asking, “Can you tell me where the Widow of Blake the artist  lives?”Letter of 19 Nov. 1828, quoted in  G. E. Bentley, Jr., “William Blake and His Circle: A Checklist of  Publications and Discoveries in 2006,” Blake 41.1 (summer 2007): 40. By the early spring of 1830 the whereabouts of Catherine appears to have become a more public concern. Blake Records reveals that on Saturday, 6 February 1830, the London Literary Gazette; and Journal of Belles Lettres featured a long anonymous review of the most recently published volume of Cunningham’s Lives, focusing exclusively upon the life of Blake and reprinting four sustained excerpts.See BR(2) 503-04. Presumably to fit in more text, the Literary Gazette merges Cunningham’s original paragraphs into considerably longer paragraphs.  Either the descriptions of Catherine in the first and final excerpts,  or perhaps the concluding passage in Cunningham’s volume itself,  describing Catherine in widowhood, inspired a reader to contact the  paper concerning the present residence of Catherine Blake. On Saturday,  20 February 1830, in its “To Correspondents” section, the Literary Gazette printed a reply: 

To Clericus: we do not know the address of the widow of  Blake, the artist; but have no doubt she might obtain liberal sums for  such remains of his productions as may be in her possession. We will make some inquiries.“To Correspondents,” Literary Gazette 20 Feb. 1830: 125.
 A year earlier, Catherine had moved from the  residence and employment of Frederick Tatham to independent lodgings in  the vicinity of Fitzroy Square.See “‘an excellent saleswoman’: The Last Years of Catherine Blake,” Blake 45.3 (winter 2011-12): 85-89. It is unknown whether the Literary Gazette  was able to trace her address for “Clericus,” presumably a potential  customer or benefactor. However, the paper’s response would have  informed its readership of Catherine’s existence and need, as well as  the perceived worth of Blake’s “productions,” which, according to the Literary Gazette, might command “liberal sums.” 
II
 
In Blake Records, Bentley records a “cursory review of Cunningham” and two essays devoted to Blake that appeared in March 1830.See BR(2) 510-24. A further review of volume 2 of Cunningham’s Lives, not recorded in Blake Records, also appeared in March 1830, in that month’s issue of the society and women’s magazine La Belle Assemblée, or Court and Fashionable Magazine, founded by John Bell.Anon.,  “Monthly View of New Publications, Music, the English and Foreign  Drama, the Fine Arts, Literary and Scientific Intelligence, andc.,” La Belle Assemblée, or Court and Fashionable Magazine ns no. 63 (March 1830): 120-23. After discussing Cunningham’s lives of Benjamin West and James Barry, the anonymous reviewer notes, “The life of another, but far more amiable enthusiast, poor William Blake, who could not only ‘call spirits from the vasty deep,’ but compel them to arise and appear before him, is, in its details, singularly striking.”La Belle Assemblée 121. The reviewer quotes Glendower’s words to Hotspur in the first part of Shakespeare’s Henry IV. Blake had drawn visionary heads of both historical figures, which were acquired by John Linnell (see Martin Butlin, The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1981] #743, 744, 745). There follows a fairly lengthy quotation from Cunningham, which discusses Blake’s drawing of visionary heads.The  passage quotes “To describe the conversation which Blake held in prose  with demons … the latter the aspect of a demon” (Cunningham, The Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, 2nd ed., vol. 2 [London: John Murray, 1830] 170-72). Presumably for the sake of space, paragraphs are merged. The reviewer comments on the visionary heads of William Wallace and Edward I discussed in the quotation: 

Many a time have we ourselves seen these portraits; and  we may here add, that the “artist of some note,” alluded to by Mr.  Cunningham, is almost as great an enthusiast as Blake himself—a gifted  enthusiast in his own beautiful art, and a yet greater enthusiast in the  science, or pretended science, of judicial astrology. His portrait,  sketched by the pen, not the pencil, of Cunningham, is nearly as graphic  as that of Blake. Some other capital stories of the worthy pair are given; but, for these, we must refer the reader to the work.La Belle Assemblée  122. In the final paragraphs of the review, the writer, while  disappointed with Cunningham’s lives of John Opie and George Morland,  deems the life of Fuseli the most important in the volume.
 The reviewer is of course referring to Blake’s friend the artist and astrologer John Varley, at whose behest a number of the visionary heads were drawn, c. 1819-25.See BR(2) 346-66. The observation that “many a time have we ourselves seen these portraits” may suggest that s/he was acquainted with Blake. The  reviewer almost certainly knew Varley and was acquainted with Linnell,  the probable owner of the visionary heads of William Wallace and Edward I  by early 1830.Butlin #734, 735. 
The letter of “Clericus” to the Literary Gazette provides  further evidence that customers and therefore potential means of income  continued to seek out Catherine Blake in her last years. Such customers  must have assisted Catherine’s ability to retain her independence in her  resumed role as printer and seller of the paintings, drawings, and  other works still in her possession, from the spring of 1829 until her  death two and a half years later. La Belle Assemblée’s discussion of Blake in its review of Cunningham’s Lives  demonstrates that a significantly larger number of people were aware of  Blake and his work in the years following his death than has, until  recently, been recognized in Blake studies.See also Keri Davies, “Blake in the Times Digital Archive,” Blake 41.1 (summer 2007): 45-46. That he is discussed so positively in La Belle Assemblée, the Vogue of its day, adds to the developing sense that he had a distinct female audience.See Keri Davies, “Mrs Bliss: A Blake Collector of 1794,” Blake in the Nineties, ed. Steve Clark and David Worrall (Basingstoke: Macmillan Press, 1999) 212-30; Angus Whitehead, “‘Mrs Chetwynd and her Brother’ and ‘Mr. Chetwynd,’” Blake 42.2 (fall 2008): 75-78. Blake had previously been employed by the magazine’s founder, John Bell.Bell had published several works featuring Blake’s commercial engravings (see BR[2] 813, 815, 818fn). Further research may reveal whether he had any further connection to La Belle Assemblée.  It is possible that he knew engravers who worked for the magazine. A  careful examination of its issues c. 1806-27 (from its founding to the  end of Blake’s life) might reveal fashion prints engraved by Blake.See  Blake’s attention to fashion detail in his illuminated books, e.g.,  “The Little Boy Found.” See Charlotte Davies, “Blake and Costume in the Songs of Innocence and of Experience,” Blake Journal 9 (2005): 74-86. In  this context it is interesting to note Blake’s knowledge of fashionable  women’s clothing, as evidenced in his references to “Stormonts,”  “Balloon hats,” “Robinsons,” and “the Queen of Frances Puss colour” in An Island in the Moon,David V. Erdman, ed., The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, newly rev. ed. (New York: Anchor–Random House, 1988) 457. as well as his living above first a tailor, William Enoch (c. 1803-04), then a staymaker, Mark Martin (c. 1805-21), and even alluding to stays in his annotations to Joshua Reynolds. See Angus Whitehead, “Mark and Eleanor Martin, the Blakes’ French Fellow Inhabitants at 17 South Molton Street, 1805-21,” Blake 43.3 (winter 2009-10): 91-92.  Both Varley and Linnell, almost certainly sources used by the anonymous  writer of the review, knew numerous upper-class fashionable women both  socially and professionally, and may therefore have had something to do  with the appearance of this review. La Belle Assemblée is an unexpected and apparently unlikely publication in which to find such an admiring reference to William Blake.

William Blake and His Circle: A Checklist of Publications and Discoveries in 2012
 
By G. E. Bentley, Jr.  with the assistance of Hikari Sato  for Japanese publications and of Li-Ping Geng 耿力平 for Chinese publications
 
G. E. Bentley, Jr. (gbentley@chass.utoronto.ca) shepherded through the press George Cumberland, The Emigrants or A Trip to the Ohio, A Theatrical Farce (1817), ed. Elizabeth B. Bentley (Edwin Mellen Press, 2013). His The  Edwardses of Halifax: The Making and Selling of Beautiful Books in  London and Halifax 1749-1826 by William, John, Richard, Thomas, and  Specially James Edwards, the Medicean Bookseller, with Catalogues of  Their Publications, 2 vols. (University of Toronto Press), 860 pp., 29 reproductions, is slouching toward publication, and William Blake in the Desolate Market: Blake’s Curious Courtship of the Goddess Fortune (McGill-Queen’s University Press), 245 pp., 33 reproductions, should see the light this year.

Blake Publications and Discoveries in 2012
 
This was a bumper year for records of previously  unrecorded Blake publications. The total is a multiple of the  discoveries in any previous year. Much of this wealth derives from WorldCat, now for the first time systematically mined for Blake. WorldCat is an extraordinary Tom Tiddler’s ground of silver and fool’s gold. On 11 December 2012 it listed 25,195 entries for William Blake.The  list is not quite so formidable as it seems, for there is endless  redundancy and irrelevance to our William Blake. Many listings are spot  on, but a significant number are so erratic as to be unusable. I looked at the first 5,000,WorldCat  does not permit one to search beyond 5,000. The last 20,000 seem to be  inaccessible. But I did get access to more by looking separately under  books (13,792), articles (4,860), and dissertations (1,704, mostly MAs).  which is one reason why there are so many ephemeral works in the  present checklist. Many of the newly recorded works here are in  periodicals that I rarely search in—indeed that I had never heard  of—such as Classification Quarterly, Francis W. Parker School Year Book, Psychological Medicine, and Victoriographics.
 
In WorldCat, I ignore archives (987 entries—I  looked fruitlessly at the first 100), audiobooks (511), images (617),  interactive multimedia (12), music (1,775), sound recordings (18), and  videos (1,176). A large proportion of the works marked here as unseen  (§) derive from WorldCat, which provided the first use of  “cunnilingus” in a title that also mentions Blake. In the catalogue, the  title of works reviewed is frequently given merely as “William Blake,”  so that the authorship, etc., given here may be significantly  hypothetical.

a. The books include reprints. Editions and catalogues are subdivisions of books, and reviews are a subdivision of essays. b. One hundred reviews in BB were published before 1863. c. The miscellaneous sources include the Essick collection, the online versions of the Times [London] and the New York Times, reviews in Philological Quarterly (1925-69), and reviews in Blake before 1992, when I began reporting reviews in this checklist. d. The books include a number of dissertations.
 
The non-English languages recorded for Blake studies in 2012 were Afrikaans, Arabic, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Dutch, French, Frisian,Note also “De Sike Roas,” HJIR no. 6 (Dec. 1996): 6 (English on p. 5), “De Tiger,” HJIR no. 1 (March 1997): 5 (English on p. 4). German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese,There are also four English essays in Japanese books and periodicals. Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovenian, and Spanish.
 
Curious Items
 
A collection of fifteen Religious Tract Society 16º  pamphlets (1841, 1846, and, mostly, n.d.), with the upper covers painted  so that when assembled they represent Blake’s Good and Evil Angels (Butlin #257), was “created in 1999 to celebrate the bi-centenary of the institution of the Religious Tract Society.”John Windle, Antiquarian Bookseller, Catalogue Fifty (San Francisco: John Windle, Sept. 2012) 8-9; the picture is reproduced on p. 8. “The Trianon Press  Collection of Dean Pananides” with “every variant,” including the Blake  Trust facsimiles, was offered in John Windle, Antiquarian Bookseller, Catalogue Fifty (San Francisco: John Windle, Sept. 2012) 61. One of the rarest pieces of Blakeana is the tiny color adaptation of the Phillips portrait of Blake for Blair’s Grave (5 x 8 cm.) (illus. 1), which speaks in favor of stamina in character and trousers. I bet even Bob Essick doesn’t have a copy.
 
  
1. A card [?1950s] with a bad color reproduction of the Phillips  portrait of Blake, 5 x 8 cm., is inscribed:  “120. William Blake … A Man of Stamina  … [an advertisement for] Stamina Self-Supporting Trousers for Men and  Boys” (copy in Victoria University in the University of Toronto).  Advertisements for “Stamina Self-Supporting Trousers” appeared in the Age [Melbourne, Australia], 18 June 1952 and 2 Dec. 1953; the firm flourished 1946-66.

 
An Action of Remarkable Generosity and Usefulness
 
With extraordinary and characteristic munificence, the Yale Center for British Art has reproduced in color on their web site virtually all their images from Blake’s prints and drawingsThe unique works include watercolors and sketches, America (M), The Book of Thel (B, R), Descriptive Catalogue (J), Europe (A) and pl. 1, The First Book of Urizen (A, C), For Children (E), For the Sexes (G), Gray watercolors, Job watercolors (New Zealand set), Jerusalem (E) and pls. 28, 30, 35, Songs of Innocence (G), Songs of Innocence and of Experience (F, L, and Alpha), There is No Natural Religion (B), Tiriel illus. 1, Visions of the Daughters of Albion (I), and colored Young’s Night Thoughts (N, Q). There are also reproductions of ordinary copies of Blake’s commercial prints such as Blair’s Grave, Dante engravings, Gay’s Fables, Hayley’s Ballads, Cowper, Romney, Triumphs of Temper, Illustrations of the Book of Job, Ritson’s Select Collection of English Songs, Salzmann’s Gymnastics, Thornton’s Virgil, and Young’s Night Thoughts.  and made it possible to download them without charge. This is an action  truly appropriate for Paul Mellon, the founder of the Yale Center.
 
The Broken Fire Hydrant
 
The problem of evanescent online works is illustrated  by Lisa Guernsey, “Searchable Archive Zooms In on William Blake’s  Illuminated Books,” Chronicle of Higher Education 17 Sept. 1997 Blake §﻿(2001)﻿, which is no longer visible.
 
Blake’s Writings
 
Mr. Arthur Vershbow of Newton Centre, Massachusetts, who died on 16 April 2012, owned Songs (p) and Blake sketches for Bürger’s Leonora (1796) (Butlin #338, BBS p. 203) and Thornton’s Virgil (1821) (Butlin #769.3), which will be auctioned at Christie’s (New York) in April 2013.See Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2012,” Blake 46.4 (spring 2013).
 
The death of Maurice  Sendak (1928-8 May 2012) is a loss not only to literature and art but  also to Blake studies. His Blake collection included: 

 
Works in Illuminated Printing The First Book of Urizen pl. 3 Jerusalem pls. 18-19, 28, 35 Songs of Innocence (J) Songs of Innocence and of Experience (H)
 
Drawings Virgil design (Butlin #769.19) Butlin #139, 245, 816
 
Engravings for Books Hayley, Little Tom (1800), colored Hayley, Ballads (1805), colored Virgil, Pastorals (1821), cuts 2-5, proofs before the blocks were cut up
 
Separate Plates “Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims,” 3rd state “The Man Sweeping the Interpreter’s Parlour,” 2nd state
 
 The new home of these unique works will be of great interest to Blake scholars. 
Drawings and Paintings
 
Genesis: William Blake’s Last Illuminated Work,  ed. Mark Crosby and Robert N. Essick with an essay by Robert R. Wark  (2012), is a remarkable accomplishment. The work had its genesis as part  of the brave series of Materials for the Study of William Blake by the  American Blake Foundation (Roger Easson and Kay Parkhurst Easson). They  commissioned from G. E. Bentley, Jr., texts for America (published 1974), Europe (published “1975,” i.e., 1979), An Island in the Moon, The Song of Los, and Visions of the Daughters of Albion,The completed typescript texts for An Island in the Moon, The Song of Los, and Visions of the Daughters of Albion remain in Bentley’s possession. and from Robert R. Wark an essay for Blake’s illuminated transcription of Genesis. Wark’s essay was set up in typeProofs of the essay are in the collections of Robert N. Essick and Victoria University in the University of Toronto. but progressed no further toward publication then.
 
Blake’s transcription of Genesis had been reproduced, much reduced in size, in Martin Butlin, The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1981), pls. 974-75, 1084-92, and in Robert N. Essick, The Works of William Blake in the Huntington Collections  (San Marino: Huntington Library and Art Gallery, 1985). The 2012  edition is a true facsimile, in color and in the enormous size of the  original—31.5 x 43.1 cm., almost as large as Vala.
 
Blake’s transcription is fascinating for what it adds  to the text of Genesis 1-4. For instance, Blake interpolated “the Lord  God formed Man ^Adam^ of the dust of the ground ^adamah^”  (2.7; see 2.19), and substituted “Jehovah” for “the Lord” (4.1) and  “Gods (Elohim)” for “gods” (3.5). His transcription is also intriguing  for what it omits. Thus for “the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any  finding him should kill him” (4.15), Blake wrote “the Lord set a mark  upon Cains forehead,” and in Genesis 1.18, 25 he omitted “and God saw  that it was good.”
 
Crosby and Essick identify “six layers of writing and  letter-coloring …. With every layer, Blake reformatted and thus  re-conceptualized his preliminary intentions” (32). It is only in this  edition that such details are visible and explored. This is a meticulous,I  noticed only two typographical errors: “srepent” for “serpent” (5) and  “scared codes” (a nice concept) for “sacred codes” (34). fascinating, and fruitful facsimile.
 
Commercial Engravings
 
A new copy of the proof of “Death’s Door” (1806) for Blair’s Grave (1808), only the third recorded, was discovered in 2012 and acquired by Victoria University in the University of Toronto—see illus. 2. Perhaps Cromek used it to show to potential customers on his subscription tours in 1806-08.
 
The plates in a French edition (1798) of Stedman’s Narrative, of a Five Years’ Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam (1796) copy Blake’s prints so closely that they must have been traced—see illus. 3-4.  Since Blake almost certainly made significant adaptations to Stedman’s  designs when he engraved them, does this mean that the French prints  deserve to be recorded in a bibliography of Blake?
 
Catalogues and Bibliographies
 
This account of publications records, among others,  Blake exhibitions and sales in 1988 (New York), 2005-06 (Cork and  Sligo), 2007 (London), 2008 (London), 2011-12 (Moscow), and 2012 (New  York, London, Vienna, and Madrid). The one in Madrid was widely  reviewed.
 
Criticism, Biography, and Scholarship
 
Four substantial collections of essays about Blake are recorded here. The first is Blake  (10 essays, 5 reviews). Of these, the most lastingly valuable are  Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2011” (spring 2012),  meticulous as always, G. E. Bentley, Jr., with Hikari Sato and Li-Ping  Geng, “William Blake and His Circle … 2011” (summer 2012), customarily  painstaking, and Abraham Samuel Shiff, “Blake’s Hebrew Calligraphy”  (fall 2012), with learned details about the eccentricities of Blake’s  written Hebrew. And Angus Whitehead, “‘Mr CLAY of Hercules Buildings’”  (spring 2012), has reliably redated the beginning of the Blakes’ stay in  Lambeth to 1791, which means, incidentally, that The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (?1790) can no longer be considered a Lambeth book.
 
The second collection is Blake 2.0: William Blake in Twentieth-Century Art, Music and Culture,  ed. Steve Clark, Tristanne Connolly, and Jason Whittaker (2012), with  17 essays about the surprisingly extensive influence of Blake in the  previous century, particularly in music. Angus Whitehead’s essay on Mona  Wilson and her biography of Blake (1927ff.) is particularly fruitful.
 
The third collection of essays is Re-envisioning Blake,  ed. Mark Crosby, Troy Patenaude, and Angus Whitehead (2012), with 12  essays, notably Keri Davies and David Worrall arguing that Blake was  probably not a dissenter, Mark Crosby and Angus Whitehead on Catherine  Blake, and Craig D. Atwood on eighteenth-century Moravian “Erotic  Spirituality” as an influence on Blake’s mother when she joined the  church.
 
The fourth collection is Blake, Gender and Culture, ed. Helen P. Bruder and Tristanne J. Connolly (2012), with 12 essays.
 
One of the most remarkable developments in Blake  studies in very recent years is the multiplication of Chinese  publications about Blake. There are 112 entries here, compared with 14  in Blake Books, 9 in Blake Books Supplement, and 74 in Blake  (1994-2012). The frequent analyses of “The Tyger” and comparison of  Blake’s “London” with Wordsworth’s “Composed upon Westminster Bridge,  1802” suggest that these themes are a set topic in Chinese education.
 
Blake’s Circle
 
There are records here of a newly discovered  Cumberland sketchbook and numerous previously unrecorded periodical  essays by Cumberland. The sketchbook has very miscellaneous sketches of  ruins in Italy (e.g., at Pompeii), buxom Italian maidens, scenery, and  dreams, plus prints and clippings. In particular, there are several very  interesting finished watercolors for Paradise Lost—see illus. 6-7, 9-10.
 
* * * * * * * * *
 
The annual checklist of scholarship and discoveries  concerning William Blake and his circle records publications and  discoveries for the current year (say, 2012) and those for previous  years that are not recorded in Blake Books, Blake Books Supplement, and “William Blake and His Circle.” Installments of “William Blake and His Circle” are continuations of Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement, with similar principles and conventions.
 
I have made no systematic attempt to record audio  books and magazines, blogs, broadcasts on radio and television,  calendars, CD-ROMs, chinaware, coffee mugs, comic books, computer  printouts (unpublished), conferences, electronic editions of works by  Blake, e-mails, festivals and lecture series, flash cards, furniture,  interactive multimedia, jewelry, lectures on audiocassettes, lipstick,  manuscripts about Blake, microforms, mosaics, movies, murals, music,  notebooks (blank), novels merely tangentially about Blake,Such as Russell Potter, ed., Pyg: The Memoirs of Toby, the Learned Pig  (New York: Penguin Books, 2012); “winsome 18th-century pig … encounters  such luminaries as Samuel Johnson, Robert Burns and William Blake”; the  work is “chiefly based on the 1817 ed. of The Life and Adventures of Toby the Sapient Pig.” pageants, performances, pillows, places named after Blake,For instance, the William Blake pub, 174-80 Old Street, London EC1V 9BP. playing cards, plays,For example, Trace Crawford, “Lady and ‘The Tyger’ or William Blake’s ‘How I met your mother,’” The Best Ten-Minute Plays 2011, ed. Lawrence Harbison (Hanover [New Hampshire]:  Smith and Kraus, 2011). podcasts, poems about Blake,Such as §Heberto Padilla, “Infancia de William Blake,” El justo tiempo humano: poemas (1962), in Spanish.  portraits, postcards, posters and individual pictures, recorded  readings and singings, refrigerator magnets, stained-glass windows,  stamps (postage and rubber), stickers, sweatshirts, T-shirts, tattoos  (temporary or permanent), tiles, typescripts (unpublished), video  recordings, and web sites.
 
I take Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement, faute de mieux, to be the standard bibliographical books on Blake,Except for the states of the prints for Blake’s commercial book engravings, where the standard authority is Robert N. Essick, William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations  (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991). Significant further details,  especially about collations, are given in Roger R. Easson and Essick, William Blake Book Illustrator: A Bibliography and Catalogue of the Commercial Engravings,  vol. 1: Plates Designed and Engraved by Blake (Normal: American Blake  Foundation, 1972); vol. 2: Plates Designed or Engraved by Blake  1774-1796 (Memphis: American Blake Foundation, 1979); vol. 3 never  appeared. The standard authority for Blake prints issued separately is Essick, The Separate Plates of William Blake: A Catalogue (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983). and have noted significant differences from them. The organization of Division I of the checklist is as in Blake Books.  In Part VI: Criticism, Biography, and Scholarly Studies, collections of  essays on Blake are listed under the names of the editors, and issues  of periodicals devoted extensively to him are listed under the titles.  Reviews, listed here under the book reviewed, are only for works which  are chiefly about Blake, not for those with only, say, a chapter on  Blake. Note that Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement normally do not include reviews. Division II: Blake’s  Circle is organized by individual (say, William Hayley or John Flaxman),  with works by and about Blake’s friends and patrons, living individuals  with whom he had significant direct and demonstrable contact. It does  not include important contemporaries with whom Blake’s contact was  negligible or nonexistent, such as John Constable and William Wordsworth  and Edmund Burke. There is nothing in Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement corresponding to Division II.
 
Research for this checklist was carried out  particularly in the libraries of the University of Toronto and Victoria  University in the University of Toronto, as well as with the electronic  resources of Copac, Google, Google Books, Google Scholar, and WorldCat. Works published in Japan were found in CiNii (National Institute of Informatics Scholarly and Academic Information Navigator), the National Diet Library online catalogue, Komaba Library and the General Library of the University of Tokyo, and the National Diet Library. For publications in China, works were found in the National Library of China (Beijing)The online catalogue of the National Library of China includes a search-and-download function for the texts of periodicals.  and the databases of Complete Texts for Periodicals in China, VIP  Chinese Periodicals in Science and Technology, and Wan Fang Data  (digitized periodicals). These Chinese online databases are very  difficult to access.
 
I should be most grateful to anyone who can help me to  better information about the unseen (§) items reported here, and I  undertake to thank them prettily in person and in print.
 
I am grateful for many kinds of favors to Sarah  Bentley, Professor Robert N. Essick (especially for an early sight of  his “Blake in the Marketplace, 2012” and improvements in this essay),  Sarah Jones (for extraordinarily meticulous copyediting), Mr. David Man  (for his web site about the Cumberland family), Dr. Jeff Mertz, Paul  Miner (for offprints), Ross Petras (for help with Arabic), Dr. Vera  Serdechnaya, Tom Simpson (rare book cataloguer, E. J. Pratt Library,  Victoria University in the University of Toronto, for bringing many  publications about Blake to my attention), and Angus Whitehead.

For Children: The Gates of Paradise (1793)
 Pl. 15 Watermark: Laid paper without watermark; vertical chain lines 2.75 cm. apart. (For Children A-B, D-E are on wove paper.) Leaf size: 7.4 x 8.5 cm. Platemark: 7.2 x 8.1 cm. Second state. History: Sold anonymously at Rosebery’s Auctions (London), autumn 2011,  to Nicholas Lott of Larkhall Fine Art (Bath), who sold it on 30 December  2011 to Robert N. Essick.All the information about For Children pl. 15 derives from Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2012,” Blake 46.4 (spring 2013), who reproduces it. 
This is the only known loose print from For Children; all the known copies are complete. However, there are numerous loose prints from For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise. The leaves for the known prints from For Children are significantly larger than pl. 15 here, and in For the Sexes only pls. 6-7 (Keynes–Fitzwilliam) are this small (7.3 x 8.9 cm.). The fragmentary For the Sexes copies J and L (far larger) lack pl. 15.
 
For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise (?1826-31)
 Copy M History: For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise pls. 1, 3, 8-18 (called copy M in BBS  p. 79), which were offered anonymously at Sotheby’s, 17 March 1966, lot  92 [bought for £180 by the dealer Christopher Mendez] and sold to  various buyers, were from the Muir facsimile (1888).Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2012,” Blake 46.4 (spring 2013), reporting what “Nicholas Lott tells me.” 
Copy M, therefore, is a ghost, here laid to rest.

Genesis (1826-27)
 
Edition
 *Genesis: William Blake’s Last Illuminated Work. Edited, with a  commentary, by Mark Crosby and Robert N. Essick. With an essay by  Robert R. Wark. San Marino: Huntington Library, Art Collections, and  Botanical Gardens, 2012. Folio, xxx, 58 pp., 23 reproductions (including  11 leaves of facsimile); ISBN: 9780873282475. 
The work consists of:
 The manuscript (11 leaves); this “is the first complete reproduction in color and the first in the size of the original” (23). “Transcription of Blake’s Genesis Manuscript” (1-6). “Notes to the Transcription” (7-9). “Substantive Differences between Blake’s Genesis Manuscript and the King  James Bible” (11-13). (Blake’s transcription of Genesis 1-4 is  fascinating both for what it adds, e.g., “the Lord God formed Man ^Adam^ of the dust of the ground ^adamah^” [2.7], and for what it omits, e.g., “and God saw that it was good” [1.18, 25].) John Murdoch, “Foreword to Robert R. Wark’s Essay” (16). “Editors’ Note to Wark’s Essay” (16). Robert R. Wark, “Blake’s Illuminated Manuscript of Genesis” (17-22).  (Wark comments that the unusual Gothic script of the text of Genesis 1-4  is not formed very fastidiously.) Commentary by the Editors (23-46), including: “Blake and the Genesis Tradition” (23-28) “Blake’s Patron, John Linnell” (28-31) “The Manuscript” (31-46) (Crosby and Essick identify “six layers of  writing and letter-coloring …. With every layer, Blake reformatted and  thus re-conceptualized his preliminary intentions” [32]) “Notes to the Editors’ Commentary” (47-51). 
This is a meticulous, fascinating, and fruitful facsimile.

Blair, Robert, The Grave (1808, 1813, 1847, 1858, [1870])
 1813 New Location: Victoria and Albert Museum (2 copies). 
Pl. 11 proof (1806), inscribed “Death’s Door.  | Tis but a Night, a long and Moonleſs Night. | We make the Grave our  Bed, and then are gone. | London Published by R. H. Cromek Feby 1st 1806”, “Drawn by Wm  Blake”, “Etched by L. Schiavonetti” (offered online in May 2012 for  £220 by Grosvenor Prints [London], bought by John Windle and sold  immediately to Victoria University in the University of Toronto). 

 
2. Proof of “Death’s Door” (Feby 1st 1806) (see enlargement of inscription) for Blair’s Grave  (1808) (Victoria University in the University of Toronto). Only two  other copies of this proof are known, one in the collection of Robert N.  Essick and one untraced. The lettering differs from that in the  published version (1808).
 
 
This makes three known copies of the 1806 proof:Much of this information derives from an e-﻿mail from Robert N. Essick to me of 30 Nov. 2012. 

Robert N. Essick copy
 Leaf size: 24.8 x 39.2 cm. Platemark: 20.3 x 35.7 cm. Watermark: Laid paper without watermark. 
Victoria University in the University of Toronto copy
 Leaf size: 20.3 x 31.4 cm. Top and bottom edges deckled. Platemark: None visible (the leaf size here is smaller than the platemark in the Essick copy). Watermark: Laid paper (faint horizontal chain lines [as in a quarto] 3  cm. apart) of indifferent quality (there are thin places where droplets  of water from the vat fell on it); two-thirds of the way up the left  margin of the printed side is a rectangular shape (4.5 cm. high, 3 cm.  wide, cut off by the margin) that must be from a watermark, and the  bottom margin has very faint regular rectangular shapes for which I  cannot account. 
Untraced copy
 Recorded in A. G. B. Russell, The Engravings of William Blake (London: Grant Richards, 1912) 130, then in the collection of F. W. Bourdillon. Watermark: “J. Whatman, 1806”; the watermark distinguishes it from the Essick and Victoria University copies. 
The first published state in the folio edition (1808) reads “Drawn by W. Blake” (not “Wm Blake” as in the 1806 proof here) and “Death’s Door” (not “Death’s Door” as in the 1806 proof).

Stedman, J. G., Narrative, of a Five Years’ Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam (1796, 1806, 1813)
 VOYAGE | A SURINAM, | ET DANS L’INTÉRIEUR | DE LA GUIANE, | CONTENANT | La Relation de cinq Années de Courses et d’Observations faites | dans cette Contrée intéressante et peu connue; | Avec  des détails sur les Indiens de la Guiane et les Nègres; | PAR LE  CAPITAINE J. G. STEDMAN; | TRADUIT DE L’ANGLAIS PAR P. F. HENRY: | Suivi du Tableau de la Colonie Française de Cayenne. | = | COLLECTION DE PLANCHES. | = | A PARIS, | Chez F. Buisson, Imprimeur-Libraire, rue Hautefeuille, No. 20. | An vii de la République [1798]. 4º, 44 prints.This is part of Stedman’s Voyage à Surinam, 3 vols. in 8º (19.6 x 12.2 cm.), 1 vol. in 4º (29.2 x 21.3 cm.). ﻿Victoria University in the University of Toronto, in original boards with marbled endpapers﻿ 
All the plates are “Gravé par Tardieu l’ainé”,“Tardieu l’ainé”  is “probably Jean Baptiste Pierre Tardieu (1746-1816)” rather than his  younger brothers Antoine François Tardieu (1757-1822) or Jean Baptiste  Tardieu (1768-1837), who were also engravers (see Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2012,” Blake 46.4 [spring 2013]). sometimes with his address, never with an imprint. In general, he copied Blake’s plates very carefully.Robert N. Essick, William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations  (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991) 72, says that the edition of “Paris,  1798” reproduces “Pls. 1, 2, 4, 5, 8-10, 12, 13, 15” and that the  edition of Amsterdam (1799-1800) has the “same plates as Paris 1798,”  but does not notice how faithful they are to Blake’s. The design  sizes of these Blake prints are mostly within 0.1-2 cm. of 18.1 x 13.1  cm. (pl. 1 is 17.7 x 13.5 cm., and pl. 2 is 18.0 x 12.9 cm.), while the  Tardieu French prints are within 0.1 cm. of 18.3 x 13.3 cm.
 
The Tardieu prints are remarkably close to Blake’s,  probably made by some form of tracing. Notice, for instance, that in pl.  vi (illus. 3), the knee-laces seem virtually identical to those in Blake’s first print (illus. 4).  However, the designs were reversed in Tardieu pls. IX, XXI, XXV,  XXXVII, and clouds have been added or the sky altered in all the Tardieu  prints after Blake. Except for the design reversals and the sky  alterations, these Tardieu prints are as closely imitated from Blake as  was possible with the technology of the eighteenth century.
 
The prints copying Blake’s are: Pl. VI: “Chaſseur nègre, armé” (illus. 3) [Blake pl. 1: “A Coromantyn Free Negro, or Ranger, Armed” (illus. 4)]. 

 
3. J. G. Stedman, Voyage à Surinam (Paris: F. Buisson,  [1798]), pl. VI, “Chaſseur nègre, armé” (Stedman–Tardieu), design size  18.3 x 13.2 cm. (Victoria University in the University of Toronto).  Notice that the soldier’s knee-laces are virtually identical to those in  Blake’s print (illus. 4).

 
 
4. J. G. Stedman, Narrative (1796), pl. 1, “A Coromantyn Free Negro, or Ranger, Armed” (Victoria University in the University of Toronto).

XIII: “Le Micou, et le Kisi-Kisi” [Blake pl. 4: “The Mecoo and Kishee Kishee Monkeys”]. Pl. XIV: “Le Capitaine Stedman fait écorcher le Serpent Aboma après l’avoir blessé” [Blake pl. 5: “The Skinning of the Aboma Snake, Shot by Cap. Stedman”]. Pl. XXI: “Esclave Samboe, déchirée de coups de Fouet” [Blake pl. 8: “Flagellation of a Female Samboe Slave”]. Pl. XXV: “Le Coiata et le Saki-winki Singes” [Blake pl. 9: “The Quato and Saccawinkee Monkeys”]. Pl. XXVII: “Planteur de Surinam en habit du matin” [Blake pl. 10: “A Surinam Planter in His Morning Dress”]. Pl. XXXII: “Marche à travers un Marais de la Guiane” [Blake pl. 12: “March thro’ a Swamp or Marsh, in Terra-Firma”]. Pl. XXXVII: “Famille d’Esclaves nègres de Loango” [Blake pl. 13: “Family of Negro Slaves from Loango”]. Pl. XXXXI [sic]: “Le célèbre Graman Quacy” [Blake pl. 15: “The Celebrated Graman Quacy”].

A combination of biographical sketch and critical analysis of several of Blake’s poems in Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience, e.g., “The Chimney Sweeper” and “The Tyger,” to mark Blake’s 200th anniversary. It does not distinguish Innocence from Experience, possibly owing to the failure to realize the differences between the two.

Many of the symbols in Blake’s Songs of Innocence and of Experience  are implicit and elusive, but most are drawn from the Bible and the  Greek myths. They can also be observed as a whole or a system, in which  Blake employs a major or a central group of related symbols to form a  dominant symbolic pattern [author’s abstract].

Cumberland, George (1754–1848)
 
Dilettante, polymath, friend of Blake
 
A remarkably excellent web site  for the Cumberland family, maintained by David Man, reproduces the  volume of 19 watercolors entitled on the handsome gilt front cover VIEWS | IN | SPAIN AND PORTUGAL | TAKEN DURING THE CAMPAIGNS OF HIS GRACE | THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON | — | BY G. CUMBERLAND, JUN. with a printed “DESCRIPTION OF THE VIEWS. … No. 6, King’s Road, Sloane Square, | London: Printed by William Nicol, | Cleveland-row, St. James’s,” signed in old brown ink “Geo Cumberland J.r”.  These were printed as VIEWS | IN | SPAIN and PORTUGAL | Taken during  the Campaigns of His Grace the Duke | of Wellington | By George  Cumberland J.r. | only 30 Copies Printed | = [watermark 1818]  with 12 prints (copies in the British Library and the British Museum  Department of Prints and Drawings). This is a parallel to G. Cumberland,  Jr., Scenes Chiefly Italian (1821).
 
The site also reproduces numerous publications by George Cumberland, including two with engravings by Blake (Thoughts on Outline [1796] and An Attempt to Describe Hafod [1796]), one that Blake owned (The Captive of the Castle of Sennaar [1798]), and Cumberland’s contributions to the Monthly Magazine.
 
A volume of “DRAWINGS | BY THE | LATE | G. CUMBERLAND”  (as it is described on the binding) was acquired in 2012 by the E. J.  Pratt Library of Victoria University in the University of Toronto. There  are scores of drawings pasted into it and loose. Many of the drawings  represent scenes from his travels in Italy (Florence, Venice, Pompeii,  Gandolfo Lake, Frascati, Naples) and later in England (“Bishopsgate near  Windsor,” where Cumberland lived for a time, Bristol [he lived for many  years in Clifton], Bath, Westminster Abbey, and Driffield, where his  brother Richard was vicar). There are portraits of his artistic friends  such as Charles Townley (engraver), Granville Sharp, Charles Stothard  and his father Thomas Stothard (Blake’s friend), Samuel Shelley  (miniaturist), and Richard Collins (miniaturist). There are also  illustrations for Paradise Lost and Don Quixote. See illus. 5-7, 9-11. 

Cumberland’s Paradise Lost watercolors are  particularly exciting because Blake was profoundly interested in Milton  (he was “of the Devils party without knowing it” [The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, pl. 6]). Blake made scores of illustrations for Milton’s works, particularly L’Allegro (6 in 1816-20), Comus (8 in 1801, 8 in 1815), On the Morning of Christ’s Nativity (6 in 1809, 6 in 1815), Paradise Lost (12 in 1807, 12 in 1808, 3 in 1822), Paradise Regained (12 in 1816-20), and Il Penseroso (6 in 1816-20). 

Cumberland’s watercolors for Paradise Lost are for Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden (illus. 6), Adam and Eve listening to the angel (illus. 7), the expulsion from the garden, called “Forsake me not Adam” (illus. 9), and “Satan Sin and Death” (illus. 10).
 
An inventory of the contents of the sketchbook will be published as “George Cumberland Sketchbook Discovered” in Notes and Queries in March 2014.
 
 
5. “The Captive designed by G Cumberland Senr 1771” (Cumberland sketchbook, Victoria University in the University of Toronto, watercolor at f. 21v).  The captive, in a brown robe, sits on a pile of straw and looks toward a  small, low, barred window. A black shape on the window embrasure may  represent the shadow of a person with a pointing finger. Beside the  captive is a low stone bench (his bed?) with a brown wicker basket on  it. A massive chain fixed to the bench seems to lead to the captive’s  right ankle, and another heavy chain is affixed to the wall behind him. 
This may be the picture of The Captive, from Sterne, which Cumberland exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1782, as lot 551.


  
 
6. Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden (Cumberland sketchbook,  Victoria University in the University of Toronto, watercolor at f. 48r).  Adam and Eve, frankly naked, are watching a squirrel in a tree, with  brilliant tropical flowers and birds round them. A reaping hook(!) and a  bound sheaf of grain are in the foreground, a lamb lying on the back of  a lion is behind Adam, and a long but harmless serpent is wrapped round  the tree between Adam and Eve.  
In all these Milton illustrations, Adam has tightly curled black hair and Eve has long wavy orange locks.


 
 
7. Adam and Eve with the angel (Cumberland sketchbook, Victoria University in the University of Toronto, watercolor at f. 49r).  Adam and Eve, both naked, are listening to a seated angel with orange  hair and a long white robe. Adam lies on the ground leaning on his right  elbow and looking with a rapt expression at the angel, while Eve stands  holding a pineapple. Exotic fruits and flowers are spread before them,  over their heads is a vine heavy with grapes and bright birds, behind  the angel is a date palm in fruit, and at the bottom right is a large  brown raptor.  
Blake made watercolors of Raphael Warns Adam and Eve (1807) (Butlin #529.6, pl. 637) and (1808) (Butlin #536.6, pl. 650).


 
 
8. John Flaxman, Adam and Eve with guardian angels (14.6 x 11.4  cm.) (n.d.) (Yale Center for British Art, Paul Mellon Collection,  B1975.4.321). The subject, except for the guardian angels, is the same  as in Cumberland’s watercolor of Adam and Eve in the garden, but there  is a powerfully dramatic contrast between the peacefully self-absorbed  Adam and Eve and the bursting energy of the guardians.

 
 
9. Adam and Eve expelled from the Garden of Eden (Cumberland  sketchbook, Victoria University in the University of Toronto, watercolor  at f. 50r), inscribed “Forsake me not Adam.” Adam and Eve  are naked but for leaves; Adam kneels on his left knee with a gesture of  submission while holding the right wrist of Eve, who hides her eyes.  Above them are date palms in fruit, beside them is a long snake, and in  the trees are bright birds. Beneath the tree canopy amid clouds a  black-haired figure with a headband gestures for them to leave. 
Blake made watercolours of The Expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden (1807) (Butlin #529.12, pl. 643), (1808) (Butlin #536.12, pl. 656), and (1820-25) (Butlin #781A, pl. 1026).


 
 
10. “Satan Sin and Death” (Cumberland sketchbook, Victoria University in the University of Toronto, watercolor at f. 51r).  Satan at left, winged and naked but for a gray cloth over his shoulders  and a shield, poises his spear at Death at right, gray and emaciated,  naked but for a golden crown. Death flourishes his spear at Satan.  Between them Sin, naked, raises her right hand to restrain Satan, while  she holds in her left hand the wrist of Death. Behind Death billow  clouds of smoke, and behind Satan are four howling dogs. In the  background is a wall of massive stones with what may be a portcullis,  and behind the dogs hangs a massive key. The legs of Sin are scaled and  serpentine.   
Blake’s designs of Satan, Sin and Death are  surprisingly similar to Cumberland’s but not close: (c. 1780) (Butlin  #101, pl. 108), (1807) (Butlin #530, pl. 725), (1807) (Butlin #529.2,  pl. 633), and (1808) (Butlin #536.2, pl. 646).


 
 
11. Two small, loose sketches with the Cumberland sketchbook (Victoria University in the University of Toronto) lettered “Geo. Cumberland Sen.r” and “Tho. Stothard, R.A.” (Stothard was elected to the Royal Academy in 1794). Cumberland’s self-portrait represents him sketching al fresco.

Cumberland, A Sermon ([1807])
 
 
12. [George Cumberland],  A Sermon, for a General Fast [1807], collection of David Man, a previously untraced work discovered in 2012 by the collector.

 = │ A │ SERMON, │ FOR A │ GENERAL FAST, │ Suitable to Christians of all denominations │ and calculated to revive the genuine spirit │ of our Holy Religion. │ = │ BY A LAYMAN. │ = │ Confess your faults one to another and pray one for another, │ that ye may be healed. James v. 16. │ = │ LONDON: PRINTED FOR LONGMAN, HURST, REES, AND │ ORME, PATERNOSTER-ROW; AND B. BARRY, BRISTOL. │ Price One Shilling. │ Lane and Co. Printers, Bristol [1807]. Location: David Man, the only copy known to me. Size: 14 x 21.6 cm., untrimmed. Watermark: Vertical chain lines. Binding: Stitched but not bound. 
This previously untraced work was described in the  posthumous “List of [Cumberland’s] Works” as “A Sermon for a General  Fast. London: Printed for Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, and B.  Barry, Bristol.” In his letter to the Monthly Magazine  33 (1 April 1812): 212, Cumberland called it “a Sermon without any  signature.” The authoritative list of Cumberland’s works in Anon., The Bristol Memorialist  (Bristol: Printed for and published by William Tyson, 1823) 63,  describes it as “A Sermon for a General Fast, suitable to Christians of  all denominations, calculated to revive the Genuine Spirit of our Holy  Religion, by a Layman, 1804.” However, the date should probably be  February 1807, for it is listed at 1s. among “Books Published February  1807” in Universal Magazine of Knowledge and Pleasure ns 7.39 (Feb. 1807): 174.

Piper sit thee down and write In a book that all may read …. (“Introduction” to Songs of Innocence, E 7)All quotations from Blake’s Songs of Innocence and other works are from The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, ed. David V. Erdman, newly rev. ed. (New York: Anchor–Random House, 1988), abbreviated as “E”. My reading of the “Introduction” to Songs of Innocence has also benefited from consulting the William Blake Archive’s http://​www.​blakearchive.​org reproductions of the copy B and U plates (1789).

Northrop Frye was, so far as I can find, the first critic to shine a light on the Greek poet Hesiod’s influence upon William Blake. Specifically, Frye judged the divine characters Tharmas and Enion from The Four Zoas (c. 1796) to be “probably the Thaumas and Eione of Hesiod’s Theogony.”Northrop Frye, Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1947) 284. Kathleen Raine, following upon Frye, in turn detected the Theogony’s presence in Blake’s The Book of Urizen (1794),Kathleen Raine, Blake and Tradition, 2 vols. (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1968) 1: 415n28; see also 2: 90. and recently Paul Miner has uncovered significant Hesiodic allusions in The Book of Ahania (1795).Paul Miner, “The Influence of Hesiod’s Theogony on Blake’s The Book of Ahania,” Notes and Queries 56 (2009): 361-64. The Theogony’s influence can similarly be traced in the divine struggles described in the continental prophecies America and Europe (1793, 1794).
 
Blake would likely have read Hesiod’s eighth-century genealogy of the gods in Thomas Cooke’s English translation (1728),Thomas Cooke, trans., The Works of Hesiod  (1728), 2nd ed. (London: Printed by John Wilson for John Wood and Ch.  Woodward, 1740; T. Longman et al., 1743). On Cooke’s achievement, see  Stuart Gillespie, “Hesiod Goes Augustan: An Early English Translation of the Theogony,” Translation and Literature 17 (2008): 197-209. See also Sir Charles A. Elton’s criticisms of Cooke in his Remains of Hesiod the Ascraean Including “The Shield of Hercules”  (1809), 2nd ed. (London: Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, 1815) iii-xiv. In  addition to Cooke’s English rendering, Thomas Robinson’s Greek/Latin  edition, Hēsiodou tou Askraiou ta heuriskomena; Hesiodi Ascraei quae supersunt, cum notis variorum  (Oxford, 1737), would also have been available to Blake, but beyond his  abilities at the time as a reader in either language. On Blake’s later  mastering of Greek and Latin, see his letter of 30 January 1803 (E 727). the first, and have found there a useful source not only for the names and attributes of those Greek deities but also for conceptualizing their generational struggles. Joseph Wittreich, Jr., argues that the Theogony in fact “provides the best introduction to the large design of Blake’s own mythology.”Joseph A. Wittreich, Jr., Angel of Apocalypse: Blake’s Idea of Milton (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1975) 246. To read Hesiod alongside Blake is indeed to witness the resemblances between their theogonies of differentiation, desire, patriarchy, and revolt,See Norman O. Brown, trans. and introd., Hesiod, Theogony (New York: Prentice Hall, 1953) 15. with Blake’s Orc cycle of “regicide and revolution”Frank M. Parisi, “Emblems of Melancholy: For Children: The Gates of Paradise,” Interpreting Blake, ed. Michael Phillips (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978) 86. See also Julia M. Wright, Blake, Nationalism, and the Politics of Alienation (Athens: Ohio University Press, 2004) 44. distinctly mirroring the Theogony’s lineage of  repression and revenge between Uranos and his son Kronos and then  between Kronos and Zeus. “Urizen,” the punning name of Blake’s  tyrannical creator god, aptly recoins the appellation of Hesiod’s Uranos as well as the  similar-sounding ourizein (Greek “to bound”) and perhaps even offers up a patrilineal portmanteau of Uranos and Zeus.
 
Yet, although critics have exposed Hesiod’s impact upon Blake’s prophetic works of the early to mid-1790s, no one to my knowledge has noted the Theogony’s influence several years prior, particularly in the “Introduction” to Songs of Innocence (1789), with its figure of the muse-struck “piping” poet (line 1). This overlooked intertextual link has led to numerous misappraisals of that introductory poem’s pastoralism and depiction of poetic investiture, and contributed to a long-standing tendency to give this first of the Songs relatively short shrift in favor of the later, more explicitly prophetic and mythic proem to the Songs of Experience from Songs of Innocence and of Experience (1794).See, for example, Maureen McLane, “Ballads and Bards: British Romantic Orality,” Modern Philology 98 (2001): 427-32. Other diminished appraisals include Robert F. Gleckner, The Piper and the Bard (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1959) 84; C. M. Bowra, The Romantic Imagination (New York: Oxford University Press, 1961) 27; Harold Bloom, Blake’s Apocalypse: A Study in Poetic Argument (New York: Anchor–Doubleday, 1963) 32; Hazard Adams, William Blake: A Reading of the Shorter Poems (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1963) 16-21; D. G. Gillham, Blake’s Contrary States: The “Songs of Innocence and of Experience” as Dramatic Poems (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1966) 149; Nick Shrimpton, “Hell’s Hymnbook: Blake’s Songs of Innocence and of Experience and Their Models,” Literature of the Romantic Period, 1750-1850, ed. R. T. Davies and B. G. Beatty (New York: Barnes and Noble, 1976) 19-35; W. J. T. Mitchell, Blake’s Composite Art: A Study of the Illuminated Poetry (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978) 4-9; Zachary Leader, Reading Blake’s “Songs” (Boston: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1981) 70; Heather Glen, Vision and Disenchantment: Blake’s “Songs” and Wordsworth’s “Lyrical Ballads” (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983) 65-66; Stanley Gardner, Blake’s “Innocence” and “Experience” Retraced (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 1986) 18-19; Andrew Lincoln, ed., Songs of Innocence and of Experience (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991) 143-44; Nicholas M. Williams, Ideology and Utopia in the Poetry of William Blake (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998) 56-58; and Robert N. Essick, ed., Songs of Innocence and of Experience (San Marino: Huntington Library, 2008) 29-32. The evidence within the “Introduction” to Songs of Innocence in fact strongly suggests Hesiod’s (likely recent) influence upon Blake in or before the revolutionary year of 1789.
 
Before composing the Songs’ leadoff poem and quasi-exordium, Blake may have paused over Cooke’s translation of these lines from the Theogony’s prooimion, describing Hesiod’s poetic ordinationSee Milton, Paradise Lost 4.674-78; Theocritus, Idylls 1, 7; Callimachus, Aetia 1: 1, 2; Virgil, Eclogues 1, 4, 6; Petrarch, Eclogues  3. Only Hesiod’s original account provides the specific details of  investiture and vocation. See also Blake’s engravings for John Flaxman’s  Compositions from the Works Days and Theogony of Hesiod (c. 1817), including “Theogony” and “Hesiod and the Muses” (William Blake Archive, Commercial Book Illustrations, Flaxman, Compositions, objects 21 and 22). by the Muses of Mount Helicon: 

So spoke the maids of Jove, the sacred nine, And pluck’d a scepter from the tree divine, To me the branch they gave, with look serene, The laurel ensign, never fading green: I took the gift with holy raptures fir’d, My words flow sweeter, and my soul’s inspir’d …. (47-52)All quotations from the Theogony follow Cooke’s English translation in the 2nd edition (see note 5, above). My readings have also been informed by Hugh G. Evelyn-White’s Greek/English edition, Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns and Homerica (1914; Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982), as well as by M. L. West’s translation in “Theogony” and “Works and Days” (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988).
 In words that may resonate in the introductory poem of Songs of Experience, whose bard the “Present, Past, and Future sees” (line 2, E 18), Hesiod proceeds to relate how, upon his investiture, 
Before my eyes appears the various scene Of all that is to come, and what has been. Me have the Muses chose, their bard to grace, To celebrate the bless’d immortal race; To them the honours of my verse belong; To them I first and last devote the song: But where, O where, inchanted do I rove, Or o’er the rocks, or thro the vocal grove! (53-60)
 
The “Introduction” to Songs of Innocence specifically echoes this narrative of receiving from the immortal Muses a freshly “pluck’d” laurel branch turned “scepter” (Greek skeptron, “staff”) and bardic “ensign.” Blake also writes of “piping songs” in “valleys wild”—a possible nod both to Hesiod’s Boeotian wilds and to the valleys below Helicon—and of thereupon having been inspired by a divine muse-like presence envisioned as a godlike child atop “a cloud” (lines 1-3). The child first commands him, “Pipe a song about a Lamb,” but then bids the pastoralist, who in the Songs’ frontispiece stands before a contented flock, to “drop thy pipe” and sing words to that tune (5, 9-10). Finally, the cloud-child requests the singer to “write” the song “in a book that all may read” (13-14). (Appropriately, one of the Songs is of course entitled “The Lamb.”) As in the Theogony, this introductory scene of divine investiture thereby presents the “story of an inspired origin,”Angela Esterhammer, Creating States: Studies in the Performative Language of John Milton and William Blake (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1994) 130. which is to say an etiological account both of the proem itself and of the verse to come.
 
The more obvious allusion to Hesiod’s prooimion follows upon the child’s sudden disappearance: 

So he vanish’d from my sight. And I pluck’d a hollow reed.  And I made a rural pen, And I stain’d the water clear, And I wrote my happy songs Every child may joy to hear. (15-20)
 Like Hesiod, Blake’s wandering speaker figures himself as a poet with this “pluck’d” piece of flora, and although there are evident differences (the piper makes of his reed not a staff but a pen, self-picked rather than bestowed), the ceremonial act likewise invests the piper with the powers of poetic composition and with the authority to sing. In short, like Hesiod, Blake’s piper is confronted by a figure of inspirationSee John H. Jones, Blake on Language, Power, and Self-Annihilation (New  York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010) 23: the cloud-child functions “as a muse figure, a voice external to the piper’s  own that aids in the production of the poem,” the latter thus being  “dialogically inspired.” Jones grants the “Introduction” considerable  discursive importance, as does Esterhammer (124-32). and transformed into a poet by that experience, gaining a new poetic, pointedly prophetic vocation and the accompanying material insignia of this art. 
What these various allusions to the Theogony arguably most illuminate is the Songs’ own emphasis upon the divine: being hailed by an inspiring muse to sing of what Hesiod devotedly calls the “bless’d … race.” Suitably, Blake’s child floats aloft angelically, and the commanded song “The Lamb” itself turns upon the theogony of Christ made human child and sacrificial lamb. For all their irony and pathos, other of the Songs—“The Little Black Boy,” “The Chimney Sweeper,” “The Little Boy Found,” “Night,” “A Cradle Song”—similarly point toward the divine and its relationship to the human. So, for example, one adult speaker “trace[s]” the “holy image” in his sleeping child’s face, and recalls that “thy maker” once “wept for me for thee for all, / When he was an infant small. / Thou his image ever see, / Heavenly face that smiles on thee” (“A Cradle Song,” lines 22-28, E 12). Blake’s poet writes songs for children, as divinely bidden, but in doing so he praises “the human form divine” (“The Divine Image,” line 15, E 13). And although his printed book will itself do Hesiod’s itinerant traveling, a muse has authorized its production, and it is to the Muses that Blake’s book of songs implicitly is dedicated, answering the child-muse’s special request of “a book that all may read.”See W. J. T. Mitchell, “Visible Language: Blake’s Wond’rous Art of Writing,” Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism, ed. Morris Eaves and Michael Fischer (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1986) 46-86, esp. 55.
 
By taking stock of Blake’s allusions to Hesiodic investiture, readers are thus less likely to misjudge the “Introduction” as merely presenting a piper who “has no duty.”Gillham 149. Instead, they find a poet who traverses the world of experience in his divinely ordained vocation of prophetic duty and poetic labor, both of which can and should be distinguished from the pastoral otium of Theocritus, Moschus, and even Virgil.See David Wagenknecht, Blake’s Night: William Blake and the Idea of Pastoral (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press, 1973) 13-14, 69, and Joseph Wicksteed, Blake’s Innocence and Experience: A Study of the Songs and Manuscripts (New York: E. P. Dutton, 1928) 81. As in the Theogony, the Songs’ muse prompts in the wanderer a newfound talent for singing as well as a prophet’s duty to perform and communicate,See Brown 35. See also Claude Calame, Masks of Authority: Fiction and Pragmatics in Ancient Greek Poetics, trans. Peter M. Burk (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2005) 92, and Kathryn A. Morgan, Myth and Philosophy from the Pre-Socratics to Plato (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000) 74: “the inspiring power endows the poet with the ability that he then uses to create songs in his own voice.” to clarify the cosmos of the human-divine: “stain[ing] the water clear” for all who’ll “hear.”For an early glossing of the “stain” as that of materialization via art, from “Ideal Song” to written book, see Howard Justin, “Blake’s ‘Introduction’ to Songs of Innocence,” Explicator 11 (1952): item 1. See also William R. Bowden, “Blake’s ‘Introduction’ to Songs of Innocence,” Explicator 11 (1953): item 41; Glen 65-66; Edward Larrissy, William Blake (Oxford: Blackwell, 1985) 27; Mitchell, “Visible Language” 55-56; Jones 51; and Esterhammer 129-30.
 
When he wrote the Songs of Innocence, Blake might have believed, as he proclaimed some years later, that the ancient Muses were only “daughters of Mnemosyne, or Memory, and not of Inspiration or Imagination” (A Descriptive Catalogue [1809], E 531; see also Milton a Poem [c. 1804-11], pl. 1, E 95). But, as Robert Lamberton points out, although Homer and other early Greek poets invoke the Muses solely to recollect the past, the Theogony’s daughters of memory “are more ambitious and in a sense are on the way to becoming the daughters of inspiration Blake invoked to replace them.”Robert Lamberton, Hesiod (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988) 65. Blake’s poet-singer, like Hesiod’s poet persona, sings of and for his muses, and in doing so recounts and affirms his bequeathed aspiration.E. D. Hirsch, Jr.’s Innocence and Experience: An Introduction to Blake (New Haven: Yale  University Press, 1964) thus rightly contends that the piper’s “Panlike occupation …  presents a contrast with his serious and dedicated occupation at the [poem’s]  end,” that “of making poetry out of such inspiration” (173). For his poetic “Inspiration” Blake looked back not only to the Bible’s prophets but also to a classical lineage extending directly from Hesiod’s Theogony. That visionary line leads us to Blake’s mythological prophecies of the 1790s and also, to judge from the “Introduction,” to the earlier Songs of Innocence and its piper made bard.

She is a graduate of Oxford and London and a former fellow of  Selwyn College, Cambridge. She is the author of Emily Dickinson and the Religious Imagination  (Cambridge University Press, 2011) and is currently writing a book  about William Blake and America. She has a particular interest in  transatlantic connections and in the relationship between literature,  religion, and the visual arts.
 
 
 
Christopher Rowland’s deeply scholarly account of William Blake’s  relationship with the Bible marks Blake out as a theologian as well as a  poet and artist. At the heart of the book is a fascination with  biblical exegesis as an imaginative activity, and it is this that makes  Rowland’s work a truly valuable contribution to Blake studies and to the  growing body of critical literature that takes the relationship between  literature and theology as its subject. Notwithstanding a strong  literary interest, Rowland’s objectives are clearly theological. He  writes, “Engagement with [Blake’s] work reshapes the way in which one  reads the Bible, views and experiences the world, and for that matter,  God” (1). By developing and nuancing our understanding of Blake’s sense  of the way text participates in affective religion, he shows how reading  Blake might perform such immense tasks. Rather than encouraging us to  see text as simply the dead letter of Urizenic law, Rowland takes on one  of the fundamental contraries in Blake’s art and tackles the idea of  text as a living body, born again in each imaginative interpretation,  and effective insofar as it is affective for the individual reader.
 
One of the most striking implications of Rowland’s approach is that  Blake’s prowess as imaginative exegete provides a way into negotiating  his own illustrated texts. In the final event, Rowland acknowledges that  Blake makes little distinction between the Bible and other great works  of literature, claiming, 

For Blake, the words of the Bible were not those which  somehow contained something peculiarly holy or special. Blake’s focus on  the effect of text, whether the Bible, or his own allusive illuminated  texts, suggests that texts are less an object to be explained than a  stimulus to the exploration of the imaginative space that biblical texts  may offer. … If [the Bible] worked as a text, to enable humans to  change, then its role spoke for itself. (242)
  Rowland’s final leveling of the Bible with other great texts seems a  remarkably brave theological position. If the Bible only “works” with an  imaginative exegete such as Blake (who makes the text as much as he is  made by it), then it is fairly redundant in the hands of a less  privileged reader. God is made by man, and not the other way round. In  one sense, this is another way of affirming Blake’s belief that  imagination is the quintessential religious faculty. Without  imagination, no text can live, and the Bible is a dead book. But it also  means that Rowland breaks new ground in considering what this religious  faculty of “imagination” might mean in exegetical terms. 
It is not surprising that Rowland places considerable emphasis on  exegetical disposition. An inner openness and resistance to  Enlightenment thinking have long been recognized as definitive in  Blake’s exaltation of the imagination. Rowland is broadly supportive of  existing work on Blake and religion and is extremely generous in his  allusions to other Blake scholars. Like Jon Mee in Dangerous Enthusiasm  (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992), he emphasizes that Blake’s religious  radicalism should be seen as part of a radical eighteenth-century  millenarianism that bears comparison with that of Richard Brothers and  has antecedents in the work of Jacob Boehme. Yet implicit in the  detailed scholarly analysis that Rowland undertakes is the idea that  disposition without education and understanding will not make for  imaginative exegesis. The real strength of Rowland’s contribution lies  in his profound knowledge of the biblical text and the years of  theological study informing and directing his interpretations. In other  words, it is evident on every page of this book that education forms  part of imaginative exegesis.  Rowland’s exegesis, like Blake’s,  rests on close reading and the ability to unpack densely allusive verbal  and visual textures. In this way Rowland makes a place for thought in  the religion of the heart and in its enabling faculty of imagination.
 
Rowland takes Blake’s set of engravings to the Book of Job as his  only full commentary on a biblical text, and as the basis from which to  draw out distinctive features of Blake’s exegesis. This works well, as  it gives the reader a way into the enormous body of Blake’s work and  allows Rowland a focus for his analysis, which naturally spreads to  Blake’s other writings and illustrations. Chapters explore the biblical  hermeneutics of Blake’s Job engravings, divine contraries, the meaning  and importance of prophecy, Blake’s place in the history of radical  biblical interpretation, Blake’s relationship with Jesus and Paul, and  his interpretation of the Bible through images. The book is beautifully  illustrated, and Rowland takes a holistic approach, bringing words,  images, and historical context to bear on our understanding of Blake’s  stature as biblical exegete. In the chapter on prophecy, for instance,  he contextualizes Blake with examples of the prophetic enthusiasm of  late eighteenth-century and early nineteenth-century Britain, as well as  with examples of biblical prophets such as Ezekiel. He argues that  Blake’s “distinctive contribution was brilliantly to encapsulate an  aspect of biblical prophecy in his focus on the ‘minute particulars’ of  contemporary life” (122). Rowland emphasizes the creative impetus of  Blake’s obscure style, claiming that the problematic and often tenuous  links between text and image mean that the pursuit of understanding needs  to be creative (129). In other words, Blake’s prophetic style requires  participatory involvement from the reader, making interpretation an  imaginative act as opposed to passive reception of meaning. Style is  therefore intrinsically connected to value, as the function of a  prophetic text is to “rouze the faculties to act” (E 702, quoted on  130).
 
There can be no doubt that Rowland’s case for Blake as a brilliant  biblical exegete is persuasive and timely. The complexity of Blake’s  thought, the quality of his composite art, and the context in which he  needs to be understood are all hugely enhanced by the wealth of  theological learning and biblical knowledge that Rowland brings to this  book. Yet one cannot help but feel that the theological and artistic  conviction that motors the argument, and that finds itself reflected and  shaped in numerous ways by Blake’s own poetic magnitude, does not allow  for any consideration of the limits that, Blake felt, constrained his  own craft.
 
Rowland identifies Los as the spirit of the prophetic imagination in  Blake’s mythology. Los is where we must put our faith. But Blake  revealed his dissatisfaction with the role of the prophet-artist as  early as 1793. An early version of the Preludium to America a Prophecy ends: 

The stern Bard ceas’d, asham’d of his own song; enrag’d he swung His harp aloft sounding, then dash’d its shining frame against A ruin’d pillar in glittring fragments; silent he turn’d away, And wander’d down the vales of Kent in sick and drear lamentings. (E 52)
 In Night 5 of Vala, the prophetic Los binds the revolutionary Orc in the chains of Urizenic repression, and by the end of Vala  the prophetic function is recognized as a distraction, a “delusive  Phantom” (E 407). Blake was troublingly aware of the possibility that  the sacred quality of imagination may not always be effective. The only  lacuna in Rowland’s book is the fact that, in celebrating Blake’s  triumph, it misses his sense of frustration.

J. B. Mertz (jeffrey_mertz@hotmail.com)  completed his doctorate on William Blake at the University of Oxford in  2010. He works for a real estate investment fund in Washington, DC, and  as an adjunct professor of English at Lindenwood University.
 
 
 
There are nine known complete copies (A-I) of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell; Michael  Phillips’s edition reproduces the copy (B) bequeathed to the Bodleian  Library by the antiquarian Francis Douce (1757-1834).Copy designations for The Marriage follow G. E. Bentley, Jr., Blake Books (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977).  In addition to the variations that make all copies of Blake’s  illuminated books distinct, copy B is further distinguished by its  frontispiece illustration, the etching entitled “Our End Is Come,” which  is not a part of any other known copy of The Marriage. The Marriage  is the only undated illuminated book produced by Blake while he lived  in Lambeth. However, “Our End Is Come” bears the date “June 5: 1793,”  and Phillips’s introduction and commentary offer a detailed exploration  of The Marriage in relation to the intellectual and cultural  milieux of the early 1790s that appear to have influenced Blake as he  produced one of his most celebrated works. Phillips also describes the  materials and methods of printmaking during the period in his account of  how Blake may have etched, printed, and colored an illuminated work  like The Marriage.
 
An undertaking such as this is certain to invite comparisons with  previous (and, in most cases, now scarce) English-language facsimiles of  The Marriage with commentaries. Max Plowman’s 1927 edition  (which reproduces copy I from the Fitzwilliam Museum, University of  Cambridge) is known to students of Blake as a high-quality color  facsimile, and Plowman’s commentary includes a significant critical  discussion of the structure of The Marriage. The next major  edition was the extraordinary 1960 color facsimile by the Blake Trust  and Trianon Press, which reproduces copy D from the Library of Congress  and includes a brief commentary by Geoffrey Keynes. Clark Emery’s 1963  edition reproduces Plowman in black and white and is not particularly  noteworthy for its commentary. Keynes’s 1975 edition reproduces copy H  (also from the Fitzwilliam) and is probably the best known and  heretofore most easily accessible color facsimile. On the verso of each  facsimile plate, Keynes provided commentary on Blake’s writing as well  as descriptions of the interlinear and marginal designs, with some  enlargements to show detail. With the exception of the third volume of  the Blake Trust facsimiles, which was first issued in 1993 and is not a   stand-alone edition (one might also mention the digital editions of  copies B-M in the Blake Archive), The Marriage has not  been published as a single-volume quality facsimile with commentary for  more than 35 years. Therefore, Phillips’s update of this challenging  work is most welcome.
 
Phillips’s edition is available in paperback as well as in a hardback collector’s edition,I  have not examined the hardback collector’s edition, but Su Wheeler of  Bodleian Library Publishing has kindly informed me that the hardback  edition reproduces the late eighteenth- or early nineteenth-century  binding of the Bodleian copy (half red morocco over marbled boards—see image of cover). and contains a color reproduction of The Marriage  (B), preceded by introductory and contextual materials and followed by  plate-by-plate commentary and a bibliography. This edition also includes  reproductions of copies K (proof copies of plates 21-24) and M (a  separate issue of “A Song of Liberty”), plate 14 from copies A, C, H, F,  E, D, G, and I (“to illustrate how Blake altered the way each was  finished over a period of more than 30 years” [31]), and the alternative  sequence of plates 15, 14, 12, and 13 from copy G. Phillips’s  plate-by-plate commentary is keyed to literary works and Blake  scholarship and includes the most extensive analysis of the  illustrations and interlinear and marginal designs in The Marriage that I have seen. Whereas earlier reproductions, such as that in David Erdman’s Illuminated Blake (1974) or in his essay “Reading the Illuminations of Blake’s Marriage of Heaven and Hell,”David V. Erdman with Tom Dargan and Marlene Deverell-Van Meter, “Reading the Illuminations of Blake’s Marriage of Heaven and Hell,” William Blake: Essays in Honour of Sir Geoffrey Keynes, ed. Morton D. Paley and Michael Phillips (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973) 162-207.  occasionally provide enlarged details of plates, Phillips’s treatment  exceeds previous efforts in detail and in the quality of the  reproductions. (I count more than 100 enlargements of details from all  plates but one of The Marriage in Phillips’s commentary.) Readers with access to Bentley’s Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement will also notice that Phillips has newly measured leaf sizes in all copies of The Marriage  and that the dimensions and descriptions provided in the helpful  checklist of copies differ in several instances from those recorded by  Bentley.
 
In his introduction, Phillips observes that “the story behind the  creation of Blake’s work is every bit as controversial as what it has to  say” (2). Readers familiar with the controversy concerning Blake’s  printing methods (for instance, whether he printed his plates using one  or two pulls), which occupied many pages of this journal in 2002,See Robert N. Essick and Joseph Viscomi, “An Inquiry into William Blake’s Method of Color Printing,” Blake 35.3 (winter 2001-02): 74-103; Michael Phillips, “Color-Printing Songs of Experience and Blake’s Method of Registration: A Correction,” Blake  36.2 (fall 2002): 44-45; Martin Butlin, “‘Is This a Private War or Can  Anyone Join In?’: A Plea for a Broader Look at Blake’s Color-Printing  Techniques,” Blake 36.2 (fall 2002): 45-49; Essick and Viscomi, “Blake’s Method of Color Printing: Some Responses and Further Observations,” Blake 36.2 (fall 2002): 49-64; Butlin, “William Blake, S. W. Hayter and Color Printing,” Blake (2002) [online only]; and Essick and Viscomi, “Response,” Blake (2002) [online only].  may be relieved that Phillips does not return to this topic except for  brief comments in the introduction (32-36). He does not shy away from  controversy, however, with respect to the question of whether Blake  completed The Marriage in 1790 or 1793. Phillips devotes considerable space in his introduction to developing the argument that The Marriage “made its first public appearance in 1793 rather than 1790” (42).For arguments in favor of 1790 as the year of completion, see Joseph Viscomi, Blake and the Idea of the Book (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993) 233-34 and 237; Viscomi, “The Evolution of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,” Huntington Library Quarterly 58 (1997): 284-85; Viscomi, “The Lessons of Swedenborg; or, The Origin of William Blake’s The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,” Lessons of Romanticism: A Critical Companion, ed. Thomas Pfau and Robert F. Gleckner (Durham: Duke University Press, 1998) 176-81; and William Blake, The Early Illuminated Books,  ed. Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi (Princeton:  Princeton University Press/William Blake Trust, 1993) 113-15 and 209-10.
 
I have only three minor complaints respecting Phillips’s edition. The  first is primarily a reflection of my own research interests, but Blake  biography as well as his career as an engraver provide some warrant for  it: I would have liked to see even greater emphasis in Phillips’s  introduction and commentary upon influential members of the circle of  Blake’s regular employer Joseph Johnson (such as Richard Price, Mary  Wollstonecraft, Joseph Priestley, and Erasmus Darwin). In this regard, I  note that Robert Essick’s excellent article “William Blake, Thomas Paine, and Biblical Revolution”Studies in Romanticism 30 (1991): 189-212. (which reads The Marriage  in relation to writings from the Johnson circle) is strangely absent  from Phillips’s introduction, commentary, and the otherwise almost  exhaustive bibliography. Blake engraved more than 80 plates for books  published by Johnson between 1790 and 1795, and may have interacted  professionally as well as socially with Johnson and his authors during  this period. Indeed, The Marriage seems to engage in meaningful and specific ways with ideas that appear in Price’s Discourse on the Love of Our Country (1789), Wollstonecraft’s first Vindication (1790), Priestley’s History of the Corruptions of Christianity (1782) and his edition of Hartley’s Theory of the Human Mind (2nd ed., 1790), and Darwin’s Botanic Garden (1791).
 
My second concern relates to Phillips’s transcription of the text.  For the most part, the transcription matches Blake’s text on a  plate-by-plate basis (which Erdman, for instance, does not always  accomplish with full accuracy), but there are the familiar difficulties  of discerning whether Blake meant to use a comma, period, colon, or  semicolon due to imperfect inking or printing of plates. I find several  instances where Phillips’s transcription does not agree with Erdman or,  it would seem, with this reproduction of copy B of The Marriage.  For example, line 13 on plate 11 is transcribed by Phillips as “And at  length they pronounced that the Gods” when the reproduction of plate 11  clearly shows “pronouncd” (again, one might cite numerous instances  where Erdman either mistranscribed Blake’s words or silently corrected  them). Of course, different copies of the same Blake title occasionally  have different text on the same plate, either because Blake altered his  copperplates between printings or overwrote words or letters on his  printed page. In this regard, Phillips’s transcription faithfully  renders a variation unique to copy B (from line 16 of plate 26), where  Blake wrote “charots” in ink, even though “chariots” printed clearly in all eight other copies.See The Early Illuminated Books 222. It is safe to say that such details do not substantially alter our reading of The Marriage,  yet few people would disagree with the importance of properly  representing the words and punctuation marks Blake engraved—to the  extent, of course, that his media will permit us to discern them.
 
Finally, the numbering of the color plates may be the occasion of  confusion for some readers. There are 52 color plates, keyed to the list  on p. vi by numbers in the lower corner of each reproduction (i.e., as  figures 1-52). Figures 3, 5, 7-31 are each further identified by  Phillips with a typed plate number in pale ochre outside the platemark  (i.e., as plates 1-27 of The Marriage) in the upper corner of  each image, which is an aid, for example, to comparing each plate with  Phillips’s transcription on pages 59-86. Confusion  may arise, however, because figures 2-3, 5, 7-31 also have a further  handwritten foliation (i.e., 1-28) in the upper corner,Su  Wheeler sent an explanation from Clive Hurst (head of Rare Books and  Printed Ephemera at the Bodleian Library) in response to my query  concerning the handwritten foliation: the numbers were written in pencil  by Hurst “many years ago” to identify images to be photographed. which is not explained by Phillips.
 
Notwithstanding these minor complaints, Phillips has produced a  volume that makes one of Blake’s most fascinating works accessible to  new readers while also providing an up-to-date critical edition for  experienced readers. It will be a valuable tool for students as well as  scholars and answers the need for a reasonably priced  stand-alone  facsimile of The Marriage. Phillips and Bodleian Library Publishing should be commended for completing this difficult undertaking.

Reviewed by Vera Serdechnaya
 
Vera Serdechnaya (rintra@rambler.ru), Krasnodar (Russia), is editor at the publisher Analitika Rodis, chief editor of the peer-reviewed journal [Language. Literature. Culture.],  and head of the literary and dramatic unit at Krasnodar Academic Drama  Theatre. She defended her thesis, “[The Narrative Strategies of Short  Prophetic Poems of William Blake (the Problems of Typology and Identity  in Historical and Cultural Context)]” in 2006. In addition, Vera is the  author of the book Short Epics of William Blake: Narrative, Typology, Context (2012).

And if the exhibition shares a little bit of the  madness and radicalism of its artist, its goal is achieved: Blake has  raised many pressing questions about man’s place in the world—it seems  like answers might be sought forever. V. D'yakonov, Kommersant-Vlast' [Businessman-Power]
 
A surprising and unprecedented event happened in Moscow at the end of  2011, when an exhibition of paintings by William Blake opened. Such a  show of Blake’s works is a great rarity, because there are no Blake  paintings in Russian art collections. The exhibition presented about 150  works by Blake and some of his “British visionary” counterparts from  the collections of the eight largest museums in the UK. According to the  web portal Gazeta.ru, “Only a few Britons have been able to see so much of Blake’s fine legacy.”
 
For Russia, the exhibition was very significant as a literary event  because, in general, for the Russian consciousness Blake remains a lyric  poet whose short works are known in some excellent translations, but  both his epics and his paintings are not well known. In the  pre-Soviet era Blake was identified in Russian criticism as a forerunner  of the symbolists. In Soviet times, along with Byron, he was considered  a “revolutionary” romantic. But the years 2010-12 became a real  renaissance for Blake in Russia, when he began to be perceived as both  brilliant and eccentric.
 
On the threshold of the exhibition several books on Blake appeared in Russian, including a new collection of translations of Songs of Innocence and of Experience—a beautiful and expensive book, with original translations of the poems and color facsimiles of Blake’s prints [see review]. In early 2011 a special issue of Inostrannaya Literatura [Foreign Literature]  came out, dedicated to the legacy of Blake. In early 2012 my monograph  in Russian on the shorter prophecies of Blake appeared, containing a  narrative analysis of his poems and tracing the perception of his work  in twentieth-century culture. Since the exhibition there has been a special Blake issue of the journal [Language. Literature. Culture.] (2013).
 
The price of admission to the exhibition was very modest, just 300  rubles (about $10). When I arrived at half past ten in the morning there  was no queue, but by the evening it stretched the length of two blocks.  The museum was also selling a lavish catalogue of the exhibition,  printed by Krasnaya ploshchad' [Red Square], at 800 rubles (about $25).  Blake’s work has never been published in Russia in such high printing  quality. It is a pity that this catalogue had so little promotion.
 
In the galleries Blake’s paintings (together with works by Rossetti,  Palmer, Beardsley, Bacon, and others) were presented side by side with  works from the permanent exhibitions of the Pushkin Museum—replicas of  ancient, medieval, and Renaissance sculptures. At the same time the  museum was hosting a show of works by a visionary of a very different  kind, Caravaggio, whose paintings were astonishingly lit in the  darkness. Blake’s paintings were hanging on maroon and gray backgrounds  in the hallways, where high columns support the ceiling. In this  environment Blake appeared to be a grand and austere classical artist,  and his connection with the highest literary tradition was confirmed by  the illustrations to Dante and Milton.
 
In the hall of the museum the organizers projected films about  Caravaggio and Blake, and it was possible to rent an audio guide for a  walk through the hallways. The exhibition halls, where they put the  works of Blake, were decorated with greatly enlarged images of prints  from Songs of Innocence and of Experience. Unfortunately, I missed the musical evenings, masterclasses, and lectures attached to the exhibition.
 
What can I say about the exhibition itself? For me, it was Blake,  with all his complexity and straightforwardness, intricate lines and  symbolism. It was him. Only later did I catch myself thinking that here  were those very pieces of paper, wood, and copper he touched two hundred  years ago. All I could do was look and try to grasp the message that, I  now saw for the first time, was so obviously bursting out of the  two-dimensional flatness of the works before me. The Deville lifecast of  Blake’s head seemed to me to be a magical artifact, one that could not  be touched, even photographed. The stern face, big eyes, pursed lips,  and frowning forehead looked as if a man, closing his eyelids, went into  fearless and detached thinking about the winepress of wrath, about  Judgment Day and the roar of an angry Rintrah. It was the face of an Old  Testament prophet. This cast made me believe in the reality of Blake’s  existence, as if it embodied his creativity, tying London and the  beginning of the nineteenth century to the present place and date. As  reported in Nezavisimaya Gazeta, “One of the most successful  exhibits accompanying Blake’s visions of his restless heroes is  the plaster head made in 1823 by James Deville, where his closed  eyes, that a plaster cast of course requires, emphasize the metaphor of  the visionary eye.” My attention was also drawn by the statuette named Newton, by Eduardo Paolozzi, who was inspired by Blake’s color prints of the subject.
 
There were quite a few people at the show, especially neatly dressed  old women, students in groups, and middle-aged men and women. The  audience apparently included those who came specifically for this  exhibition and those who did not know anything about Blake before. I was  very interested: what did they see in his paintings, being familiar  with his works only by hearsay? What about those who saw these paintings  for the first time in their lives?
 
I found some answers to my questions in the response book, filled  with remarkable and candid comments. Here are the most vivid excerpts,  in the order that the lines were recorded: 

Creator Guardian manifested in you Rain poured down grace Moved into your brain And poured the grandeur of creation (Dedicated to William Blake, Tatiana Logunova, Kiev)
 
Perhaps, it is the right time today to share W.  Blake’s point of perception, as the present world enters, apparently, in  the most tragic phase of its existence. (Unsigned)
 
I really did not like Blake. But thanks for the exhibition. (Korea)
 
The exhibition left me with a painful impression.  It was evident that this man was a master of the letter, but the  impression communicated to the audience was a kind of insanity. The soul  can relax, warm up only at the Caravaggio exhibition … But here? Some  worms, no good for the soul. (Isayeva Ye.Yu., teacher, age 54)
 
… boring monotonous schizophrenic. It would be better to ship more Caravaggio than this abnormal old man, God rest his soul. (Yasha)
 
Thanks to the art of W. Blake, immediately,  directly from today, I will start my reading of Bible stories. This was a  trial for some unprepared visitors and tortured my conscience …. (Unsigned)
 
For many years, I dreamt of seeing an exhibition of Blake’s legacy. The atmosphere—something between the divine and dreadful. (Unsigned)
 
There were plenty of opinions, many greatly contrasting. Some spoke  of Blake’s total incomprehensibility, while others advised the  organizers not to prompt viewers to the idea of romantic madness, so  deceptively simple. However, in Blake’s own time, nobody would have  stood in line for his show: he was simply not well known and generally  the public didn’t need him. As written on the Gazeta.ru web  site, “for the average art lover getting a deep sense of Blake’s stories  is still entering a dark forest. There is just a little difference  between us and his contemporaries, except that the overall appraisal has  changed from negative to positive.”
 
And yet, the queue half a kilometer long standing in front of the  museum in the late afternoon showed that Blake may have established  himself in Russia. His works have had a deep effect on some in the  audience, and the press reviews testify to both the profound  indifference and the bright impression made by the works of Blake in  Russia.

In 2009 one of the largest Russian museums, the Pushkin State Museum  of Fine Arts, joined with the Tate and the British Council to begin to  organize a Russian exhibition of Blake’s works for the first time ever;  it opened in November 2011 [see review]. The British Council also suggested that a new translated edition of Songs of Innocence and of Experience  should be published on the occasion. The Russian State Library for  Foreign Literature partnered with the council to organize the workshop  of translators and publish the book. The publication is unusual for  Russia in that it is based on an earlier boxed small-format edition  issued by the Folio Society (1992), later republished unboxed by Tate  Publishing in 2006 and 2009. For the first time in Russia, this edition  reproduces the illuminated prints of the Songs, and all  translations are new, the result of a competition among members of the  translation workshop. The translations judged most successful were  included alongside the images, with introductions by Richard Holmes and  Gregory Kruzhkov as well as critical commentary by Sasha Dugdale. The  translations presented in the book represent a modern vision of Blake  and successfully compete with a number of classical translations of  Blake into Russian, such as those by S. Ya. Marshak, S. Stepanov, and  others.
 
In a general introduction, which is translated by S. Lichacheva from  the Folio Society edition, Holmes declares: “Blake uses the modality of  children’s verses to create a wholly adult poetry”; this essay, though  brief, provides a biographical sketch and points the way into the cycle  of poems. Kruzhkov’s preface introduces the reader to the history of  Russian translations of Blake, in particular those of Songs of Innocence and of Experience.  The commentary by Dugdale clearly describes in detail the metaphorical  and symbolic patterns of Blake’s poetry. Previous Russian editions of  Blake sorely lack such commentary.
 
The color images, from the King’s College copy of Songs, for  the first time allow the Russian reader to appreciate the originality  of the syncretic nature of Blake’s gift—not only as a poet but also as  an original artist and engraver. Although Russia already has bilingual  collections of Blake’s poems, the originals have never before been  reproduced graphically page by page.
 
The translations in the book do not, of course, contain a complete  systematic interpretation of the imagery and melodic poetry of Blake,  but they offer a sort of kaleidoscope of possible approaches to his  poetry. And while every successful new translation is just a step in the  direction of the original, the poems in this edition collectively  represent much progress. It is also important that the format of the  workshop allowed the translators to find multiple approaches to the same  poems: the appendix to the edition gives interesting alternative  translations not included in the main text. Thus, the Russian reader has  the opportunity to consider disparate translations of poems, including  three versions of “Holy Thursday,” “The Fly,” “Ah! Sun-Flower,” and “A  Little Boy Lost.” Many of the new translations are clear successes that  open for Russian readers new incarnations of familiar paired works by  Blake, especially “The Lamb” by A. Kruglov and “The Tyger” by M. Lipkin,  and “Infant Joy” by M. Falikman and “Infant Sorrow” by M. Kostionova. A  general trend of these translations is to preserve the rhythmic spirit,  as in the dance-like “The Ecchoing Green” (trans. M. Falikman) and  “Laughing Song” (trans. S. Lichacheva), and the epic rhythm in “Earth’s  Answer” (trans. A. Kruglov) and “The Voice of the Ancient Bard” (trans.  M. Kostionova).
 
At the same time, striving to adhere to the original poetic form may  lead to an inadequate interpretation of content. For example, in the  “Introduction” to Innocence, translated by M. Kostionova, the  third stanza introduces an angel appearing to a baby in a cradle,  neither of which exists in the original! Examples can be multiplied, but  we can say that the main purpose of publishing this translation—to let  Russian readers escape from the shackles of traditional translations of  Blake and bring their perception of Songs of Innocence and of Experience  to a new visual level—has been achieved. This is definitely the most  visually attractive edition of Blake in Russian, and may inspire more  new approaches to making his works accessible to Russian speakers.

Harpers and Other Drawings: The Case for a Unified Composition
 
By Martin Butlin
 
Martin Butlin is the former keeper of the historic British collection at the Tate, London. He is the author of detailed catalogues of The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake and, with Evelyn Joll, The Paintings of J. M. W. Turner.
 
 
 
The recto of the newly discovered drawing  from the album of drawings descending from Charles Augustus Tulk, now in  the possession of the London art dealer Lowell Libson, has received two  contradictory descriptions. Robert N. Essick, in his “Blake in the  Marketplace, 2012,” Blake 46.4 (spring 2013): illus. 9,  sees it as a “central drawing of a man and woman playing harps and  perhaps singing” together with “several other sketches, apparently  unrelated to the central drawing.” The anonymous entry in Libson’s  catalogue British Paintings and Works on Paper,  2013, p. 50, illus., treats it as a single composition, an early stage  in the evolution of the various series of watercolors, drawings, and  engravings dealing with the biblical story of Job. This is distinct from  the drawings on the reverse of the paper, which in spite of the very  basic landscape element linking the figures across the bottom and hints  of clouds linking some of the figures above, are to all intents and  purposes studies of individual figures or groups of figures, most of  which later reappear in America or Europe; both recto  and verso are conveniently reproduced facing each other in Libson’s  catalogue. My first reaction on seeing the drawing, which I have done on  a number of occasions, was that the recto is a single composition and  one that certainly suggests associations with the book of Job. Further  study of the fine illustrations in Libson’s catalogue has confirmed me  in my belief that the work is a single composition, though the question  of its subject is more problematic.
 
Unlike the separate figures or groups on the verso, the figures on  the recto are more or less contiguous and some elements overlap. The  forms of the large harp, placed behind the young man on the left, are  carefully drawn so as not to overlap that figure, suggesting that Blake  began with the young man and then went on to draw the two harp-playing  figures.
 
Despite the male musician’s being rather more heavily drawn than his  companion they are clearly a pair, the one overlapping the other. The  conjunction with the girl holding a child seen in profile and taken  from, or anticipating, the similar figures in The Dream of Thiralatha  seems to be equally deliberate, the edge of the chair touching or just  overlapping the girl’s heel (this can be seen particularly easily in the  detail of the drawing in Libson’s catalogue). Both pairs of children  are set slightly further away than the two musicians and indeed,  unusually for Blake perhaps, there is a distinct recession in depth in  the placing of the figures, from the young man in the foreground on the  left by way of the two seated musicians to the two children.
 
This recession is emphasized by two parallel lines running across the  paper. The further one is partly drawn, partly implied, and starts with  the soles of the feet of the children, is continued with the bottom of  the leg of the chair, and carries on to the left of the harp of the male  musician, where it is more strongly drawn than the other horizontal  lines on the background feature both above and below, an emphasis that  seems to have little or no descriptive function. This continuity of line  is surely not accidental. The other line runs across the foreground,  starting perhaps as a shadow cast by the young man on the left but  continuing right across to the right edge of the paper, neatly  underlying and unifying what I see as a single composition.
 
The two figures above direct what seem to be two somewhat different  forms of evil force onto the female musician and the larger group of  children, again with a slight recession in depth. Incidentally, the  further airborne figure would appear to be male, with a long beard that  overlaps the arm of the accompanying female figure. Both these figures  emerge from clouds indicated by curving lines that extend across the  paper from the left edge, above and to the left of the young man, to the  right margin above the children. The clouds even seem to blot out the  top of the upright element of the chair between the female musician and  the largest child. The background on the left is difficult to make out  but reinforces the impression that these figures are in a particular  setting, not just randomly spread across the sheet of paper.
 
The subject of the drawing is less clear. As Essick points out, harps  are not solely associated with Job and his family (indeed, they hardly  appear in the biblical account save, at Job 21.12, as appurtenances of  the wicked together with the timbrel and organ). However, the only other  known pair of figures playing harps is Har and Heva in the lost fifth  illustration to Tiriel. Nor does the head of the putative Job  resemble any of Blake’s other depictions. In fact this baby-faced,  slightly weak and epicene character does not seem to occur anywhere else  in Blake’s large repertory of facial types. Nor does the number of  children shown match the seven sons and three daughters of the biblical  text. But it is difficult to find another match to the depiction of a  group of figures, apparently related as in a family, being attacked by  supernatural forces. It could be that Blake had some more general idea  as he made the drawing of an apparently happily settled family  unexpectedly attacked. This could have later evolved into the series of  illustrations to the book of Job.

In the long, heat-filled days that compose a typical Spanish summer,  an exhibition of William Blake’s work appeared in Madrid, the first in  Spain since 1996. A collaboration between Spain’s La Caixa  Foundation—also the organizers of the nation’s first showing of Blake in  1996—and Tate Britain, the exhibition presented Blake as a leading icon  of British art, a rebel artist who inspired subsequent generations of  artists.
 
The venue is an interesting starting point. La Caixa is essentially a  savings bank, its logo designed by Joan Miró, which operates as a  nonprofit bank among dozens of such banks in Spain, whose collective  mission is to give back to communities by investing in public welfare  projects including scientific, cultural, social, and research programs.  The CaixaForum, a four-story converted electrical building with a mass  of reddish-orange oxidized iron as its crown, is juxtaposed nicely with  the greenery of Spain’s largest vertical garden, designed by French  botanist Patrick Blanc, and is located in the center of Madrid, steps  away from the Prado.
 
The exhibition displayed works by Blake ranging from engravings to  watercolors to prints and temperas, covering the breadth of his artistic  career. Over eighty works, mostly from the Tate’s collection,  demonstrated his range in terms of size, method, and theme. According to  the exhibition materials, the intent was to highlight Blake as “one of  the most influential figures” in British cultural history, a visionary  who anticipated the artistic movements that followed, namely the  Pre-Raphaelite, neoromantic, and postmodern movements. The annotated  journey through the artist’s creative vision ended with a review of his  artistic legacy.

For me, the journey began with a primarily visual sensation: the  color of the walls, a striking aubergine emblazoned with red-toned text  for headlines, seemed to have been chosen to set off the textured whites  and yellows in nearly all of Blake’s work exhibited. Visitors were  greeted at the entrance by Thomas Phillips’s 1807 portrait of Blake  hanging on the dark purple wall of the anteroom, and then moved through  the exhibition’s twelve sections and subsections, labeled in both  Spanish and English, all of which served to impress upon the viewer that  Blake was a versatile artist who experimented widely with technique,  medium, and theme. The exhibit was organized thematically rather than  chronologically in order to articulate its premise that Blake stood  apart from other artists of his time.
 
Sections highlighted his various methods and thematic concentrations.  The first, emphasizing his early artistic life as an apprentice, was  disappointing in that it featured only two pieces that were not  engravings. However, these pieces served as a starting point for the  assertion that Blake was, even in his early career after his time at the  Royal Academy, unconventional in the production of ideas through his  art. His Age Teaching Youth (c. 1785-90), a small meditative  work where the humanized figures of experience and innocence sit side by  side, was juxtaposed with the more conventional Oberon, Titania, and Puck with Fairies Dancing (c. 1786).
 
To illustrate further his imaginative and metaphorical approach,  there was a focus on his self-created mythologies, which the exhibit  declared his “most complex and original works,” in an area dedicated to  Blake’s prophetic books. The human body, especially the body of Urizen,  was the centerpiece of these works, in which soft, contoured lines  delineated tormented poses and expressed radical representations of  terror. The viewer was prompted to glean Blake’s political tendencies in  this section. His Visions of the Daughters of Albion (1793),  where we see both men and women enslaved, chained to immovable rock, was  presented as a commentary on sexual freedom, gender roles, and  equality.
 
In addition to introducing Blakean themes, there was also an emphasis  on technique. An area featured his innovative use of tempera by  employing the technique of defining lines and contours in black ink  after applying layers of gum-based color, highlighting Blake’s belief  that a work of art was all the more perfect “the more distinct, sharp,  and wirey the bounding line.” Works exemplifying the variety of  materials used by Blake, such as canvas atop cardboard, iron, or  pine—the latter used for Winter (c. 1820-25), which is nearly  completely white—were displayed alongside the spiritual portraits of  contemporaries William Pitt and Lord Nelson. One of Blake’s more  delightful, imaginative works, The Ghost of a Flea (c.  1819-20), was featured prominently. Crowds gathered around it, perhaps  to read the lengthy label describing its origin as one of Blake’s  magical visions, or perhaps to glimpse its fine detail despite its  diminutive size.
 
In a slightly out-of-the-way area, next to a room of Blake’s unfinished series for the Divine Comedy (from the 1820s), images of pages from a copy of Songs of Innocence and of Experience  were projected along with a digital “page turner” of his Notebook, so  one could turn its many pages by swiping a screen. Each page included  very detailed descriptions in both English and Spanish. The space  underscored the interrelationship between writing and image, the realm  in which Blake really shone, which was clear even in translation.
 
To prompt the link between Blake and artistic movements that followed, his tiny wood-block engravings for The Pastorals of Virgil  (1821), featuring mainly pastoral scenes, were presented as antecedents  to works of the group of acolytes who called themselves the Ancients,  displayed in the same room. It was difficult to miss the nearly  identical shepherd figures of Blake’s Thenot in the frontispiece for The Pastorals of Virgil  and George Richmond’s “The Shepherd” (1827). The Ancients admired  Blake’s visionary genius; however, theirs was a more nostalgic worldview  akin to late romanticism and lacking the social-critical inference of  Blake’s oeuvre.
 
In contrast, Blake and the Pre-Raphaelites shared similar visual and  ideological interests. Visualizing mythology was one such parallel. For  the Pre-Raphaelites, of course, this often meant the depiction of  Arthurian myth. The more radical Pre-Raphaelites appreciated Blake’s  visionary approach and his belief in the role of the artist as  prophet-philosopher. Here, work by the movement’s great artist Dante  Gabriel Rossetti—a “complete” artist like Blake—offered direct thematic  ties to Blake with a Dante-inspired wood engraving, and also technical  similarities of medium, the human form, and spatialization (How Sir Galahad, Sir Bors, and Sir Percival Were Fed with the Sanc Grael  [1864]). Also mentioned was Rossetti’s involvement, along with  Alexander Gilchrist, in Blake’s biography, which helped to establish  Blake’s eminence in British art.
 
Radicalism being the link, pieces from the symbolists were shown to  delineate again a more ideological connection with Blake. They were  advocates of the prophetic role of the artist and viewed Blake as their  ancestor. In the soft-colored, spiritually themed works of George  Frederic Watts, the ink of Aubrey Beardsley, and a stark lithograph of  Charles Shannon, among others, recurrent mythological themes and the  prominence of lines were unmistakable.
 
Lastly, the exhibition pointed toward Blake’s legacy with examples  from the twentieth-century neoromantic movement. Due to a lack of  explanation, the connection to these artists was more tenuous, despite  the display of a small-scale version of Eduardo Paolozzi’s sculpture Newton (1988) and the thematic parallels and dramatic reds of Cecil Collins’s The Fall of Lucifer  (1933), which appeared to be a direct reworking of Blake’s work of the  same name for the book of Job. Some of the works supplied here had  closer connections to surrealism or expressionism than they did to  Blake; take, for example, Collins’s The Poet (1941), with its  triangular figures set in a Daliesque landscape. This was one of the  weaknesses of the exhibit. The areas that stressed Blake’s influence on  these movements could have been more extensive, if not more fully  explained through direct comparisons or commentary. I found the  connections to be vague, especially in the case of the neoromantics,  whereas there were such rich descriptions in other areas of the  exhibition. In addition, the digitalized image area, including Blake’s  chronology, should have been located more prominently.
 

 

 
Late in the summer I corresponded with the exhibit’s coordinator,  Eduardo Rostan Robledo, who works at the CaixaForum Barcelona; he  reported that interest had been very high. When I visited the exhibit in  its first week (the first of many visits) it was full of people and the  din of whispers and admiration. In Spain, Blake has often been referred  to as “el Goya inglés,” the English Goya, comparing him to the nation’s  most revered painter of the romantic era. The comparison, of course,  refers to the artists’ singular styles and sometimes subversive approach  to their subjects. Spain already loves him. It verifies that, as the  exhibition materials suggest, Blake’s prestige and legacy only increase  with time. Blake, like Goya, whose paintings hang across the street at  the Prado, deserves a prominent place in the realm of art. He endures,  marking the canvases of later generations, much like the vermilion still  glowing bright in his own work.

Duncan’s Reading of Blake
 
William Blake and the twentieth-century American poet Robert Duncan have a natural affinity.For other essays and books detailing this affinity, see Robert J. Bertholf, “Robert Duncan: Blake’s Contemporary Voice,” William Blake and the Moderns, ed. Robert J. Bertholf and Annette S. Levitt (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1982) 92-110; David Annwn, Hear  the Voice of the Bard! Who Present, Past, and Future Sees—Three Cores  of Bardic Attention: The Early Bards, William Blake and Robert Duncan (Hay-on-Wye: West House Books, 1995); Edward Larrissy, “Two American Disciples of Blake: Robert Duncan and Allen Ginsberg,” Blake and Modern Literature  (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006) 108-24; and Jerome McGann, “Art  and Error: With Special Reference to the Poetry of Robert Duncan,” Modern Language Studies 27.2 (spring 1997): 9-22.  Both were profoundly interested in the penetrative mobility between the  temporal and the eternal. They also have an affinity as poets who used  their mythopoeic forms to explore the ethical boundaries between self  and other and to relate that exploration to the violent politics of  their respective historical moments. For Duncan  and his coterie, Blake was yoked with Whitman; they were old male bards  of the prophetic tradition, mingling visionary poetics with homosexual  and homosocial freedoms.Duncan’s coterie was, by his own admission, a boys’ club. See Michael Davidson, The San Francisco Renaissance: Poetics and Community at Mid-century (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989) 175-76.  This article argues that if we look at the way Duncan read Blake and we  read both poets alongside each other, we arrive at a better  understanding of the involvement of politics with hermetic vision.
 
Influenced by Yeats and Ellis’s  ground-breaking 1893 edition of Blake’s work and conditioned by his own  occultist upbringing, Duncan read Blake as a poet of hermetic vision.The Works of William Blake: Poetic, Symbolic, and Critical,  ed. with lithographs of the illustrated “prophetic books,” and a memoir  and interpretation by Edwin John Ellis and William Butler Yeats, 3  vols. (London: Bernard Quaritch, 1893). For Duncan, Blake sees  clearly into the essential truth of his own time, and this insight  carries a deep social responsibility. In Roots and Branches and Fictive Certainties,  Duncan draws from his sense of an occult Blake to deepen his own  exploration of the poetic textures of personal experience. In Bending the Bow,  he takes his reading of Blake beyond the personal and poetic  implications of occult mysticism toward an intensely ethical political  engagement. This does not represent a rupture from the concerns  expressed in Roots and Branches and Fictive Certainties,  but a development. In both instances, Duncan comes into his creative  potential thinking about Blake in terms of touch. The act of touching  something, or someone, had a particular personal significance for him as  a signifier of both intimacy and reality. At the age of three he was  hurt in an accident in the snow and became cross-eyed so that he saw  double. In Roots and Branches he spoke about the effects of his injury in metaphysical terms: “I  had the double reminder always, the vertical and horizontal  displacement in vision that later became separated, specialized into a  near and a far sight. One image to the right and above the other. Reach  out and touch. Point to the one that is really there.”Robert Duncan, “A Sequence of Poems for H.D.’s Birthday, September 10, 1959. Finishd October 24, 1959,” Roots and Branches (New York: New Directions, 1964) 14.  Duncan implies that if we can touch something, we can verify its  quiddity and its reality. It is reassuring to touch because it confirms a  connection and dispels an illusion. Touch therefore becomes a way of  envisioning the world and confirming the relationships that exist within  it. 

So, Duncan started to think about the metaphysical significance  of touch at a very early age. The ethical dimensions followed naturally  from a sense of touch that had already become associated with vision. In  his poetry, Duncan uses the extended conceit of touch and the  provocations offered by the extremes of violence and tenderness in order  to explore the ethical relationship between self and other and the  interface between the personal, political, and poetic implications of  that relationship. The intimacy of touch also becomes a way of imagining  poetic influence and Blake’s impact on Duncan’s own sense of poetic  identity. The extended conceit is vital to Duncan’s repeated return to  the ethics of boundaries and boundary crossing. The metaphor works  because it emphasizes boundary as a real and tangible distinction and  because it offers ways of transgressing that distinction.
 
Duncan’s reading of Blake therefore suggests the discovery of a  relevant and restorative romanticism with which to address the modern  world. Kristin Prevallet has written that, for  Duncan and his contemporaries in the San Francisco Bay Area, romantic  identification provided a utopia; it helped form an imaginary community  where they could live free from the intolerances of mainstream America.Kristin Prevallet, “Introduction,” A Helen Adam Reader, ed. with notes and introduction by Kristin Prevallet (Orono, Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 2007) 19. In the early 1950s Duncan started publishing in the Black Mountain Review  and in 1956 he taught at Black Mountain College. Like Blake, Black  Mountain’s founder, John Andrew Rice, thought everyone was born an  artist but some were oppressed by the public world. Black Mountain was  established in order to provide an escape where people could reassert  their artistic nature. The central challenge facing Black Mountain poets  was arguably to reinvent romantic poetics for contemporary American  existence.
 
Fed up with what he perceived as the narrowing of vision in the modern world to a “theater of the absurd,”Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth,” Fictive Certainties (New York: New Directions, 1955) 5.  a stage where atomic disaster and the end of humanity were the only  stories seen by the reasonable anti-mythopoeic mind, Duncan found hope  in Blake. Duncan claimed that

in England, the divine Blake broke through the confines of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century rationalist poetics with his Marriage of Heaven and Hell,  blasting that model of self-righteous and reasonable men, the Deist,  and howling against the first factories and machineries of his own day’s  versions of what [Rudolf] Bultmann considers to be the modern  scientific man for whom: “it is impossible to use electric light and the  wireless and to avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical  discoveries, and at the same time to believe in the New Testament world  of spirits and miracles.”Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth” 27-28.
 Blake appealed to Duncan because he seemed to be both of this world and another. 
Recalling his introduction to Blake by the poet Helen Adam, Duncan commented: “I  was already a convert to the Romantic spirit, and myth in that spirit  is not only a story that expresses the soul but a story that awakens the  soul to the real persons of its romance, in which the actual and the  spiritual are revealed, one in the other.”Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth” 31. As  Robert Bertholf has argued, Adam’s reading of Blake in Duncan’s poetry  seminar proved an important turning point for Duncan, at least partly  because it came at a moment when he was thinking about Charles Olson’s  essay on “Projective Verse.”Bertholf 99. Adam had brought the “Introduction” to Blake’s Songs of Experience as an example of great poetry to a class that Duncan ran at Black Mountain. The poem begins: 

Hear the voice of the Bard! Who Present, Past, and Future sees Whose ears have heard, The Holy Word, That walk’d among the ancient trees.William Blake, “Introduction,” pl. 30, Songs of Innocence and of Experience, ed. with introduction and notes by Andrew Lincoln (Princeton: Princeton University Press/William Blake Trust, 1991).
 It chimed remarkably well with Olson’s statements about contemporary poetics. Olson claimed: “Verse now, 1950, if it is to go ahead, if it is to be of essential  use, must, I take it, catch up and put into itself certain laws and  possibilities of the breath, of the breathing of the man who writes as  well as of his listenings.”Charles Olson, Projective Verse (New York: Totem Press, 1959) 3.  Duncan must have heard the echo of Olson’s poetic definitions  reverberating in Blake’s call to hear the prophet-artist, whose  particular quality of inspiration (“breath” or “breathing”) arises out  of his privileged position as listener. And the awakening that Duncan  describes is also very much in tune with Olson’s question: “What stance  toward reality brings such [projective] verse into being[?]” Olson  argues that the degree to which the projective involves a stance toward  the reality outside the poem as well as a new stance toward the reality  of a poem itself is a matter of content. He writes: 
If the beginning and the end is breath, voice in its largest  sense, then the material of verse shifts. It has to. It starts with the  composer. The dimension of his line itself changes, not to speak of the  change in his conceiving, of the matter he will turn to, of the scale  in which he imagines that matter’s use. … What seems to me a more valid  formulation for present use is “objectism,” a word to be taken to stand  for the kind of relation of man to experience which a poet might state  as the necessity of a line or a work to be as wood is, to be as clean as  wood is as it issues from the hand of nature, to be as shaped as wood  can be when a man has had his hand to it. Objectism is the getting rid  of the lyrical interference of the individual as ego, of the “subject”  and his soul …. For a man is himself an object …. If  he stays inside himself, if he is contained within his nature as he is  participant in the larger force, he will be able to listen, and his  hearing through himself will give him secrets objects share.Olson 10-11.
 
The two-way revelation between the “actual” and the “spiritual”Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth” 31.  that Duncan describes as pertinent to his appreciation of Blake is  present in Olson’s conclusions about the poetic function. In the  attention he pays to the reality outside the poem, the field of  composition, Olson blurs the distinction between spiritual and actual  existence, imagining them, as Duncan does, in dialogue with each other.  The simile he uses to describe the relation of man to experience is  drawn from the natural world and suggests an intimacy with the actual.  But Olson’s subsequent claim that “[man] is contained within his nature  as he is participant in the larger force” imbues the natural or actual  with a sense of the cosmic. In the end Olson arrives at a poetic ideal  that resonates deeply with Blake’s prophet-artist: “his hearing through  himself will give him secrets objects share.” It is important that  Duncan was thinking about Olson’s essay when he was introduced to Blake,  not only because of the emphasis that Olson places on the interplay  between the aural and the oral, but also because of the attention he  gives to the place of the actual in visionary poetics.
 
If Duncan’s response to Blake was heavily conditioned by his reading  of Olson, it was also typically American in aligning Blake with Walt  Whitman. In 1868 Algernon Charles Swinburne had  claimed that “the points of contact and sides of likeness between  William Blake and Walt Whitman are so many and so grave, as to afford  some ground of reason to those who preach the transition of souls or  transfusion of spirits,” and the comparison was taken up  enthusiastically by readers on both sides of the Atlantic.Algernon Charles Swinburne, William Blake: A Critical Essay  (1868; London: Heinemann, 1925) 300-01. For more on the connection  between Blake and Whitman, including Whitman’s own ambivalent reaction  to it, see Linda Freedman, “Walt Whitman and William Blake: The  Prophet-Artist and Democratic Thought,” Transatlantic Traffic and (Mis)Translations, ed. Robin Peel and Daniel Maudlin (Durham, New Hampshire: University of New Hampshire Press, 2013) 133-55. Duncan continues the association between Blake and Whitman. In his essay on Whitman, he writes:
 
Taking his Self and his Law, Poetics  and Politics, not in the architecture of an Other World, but in an  identification with the creative forces working within masses and  populations, the poet was to work toward the Wedding of the Ideal and  the Actual, even as Blake had proposed a poetic marriage of Heaven and  Hell in the Actual. Whitman saw within the actuality of These States the  idea of an America latent and at work. Not a poetry commemorative of an  established order or a poetry striving to perfect an order out of  chaos, but a poetry creative “in the region of imaginative, spinal and  essential attributes, something equivalent to creation … imperatively  demanded.”Duncan, “Changing Perspectives in Reading Whitman,” Fictive Certainties 166-67.
 
Duncan presents Whitman as the exemplary democratized prophetic  voice, seeking an “identification with the creative forces working  within masses and populations.” In doing so, he implicitly extends the  principles of hermetic vision to the political sphere. As the eternal is  realized within the temporal, the “creative forces” find their active  and disruptive embodiment in the “masses and populations.” This passage  shows the extent to which Duncan’s sense of Whitman was informed by his  reading of Blake, and vice versa. It is from Blake, read through Olson’s  lens, that Duncan derives his understanding of the poetics of the  polis. He was clearly aware of how deeply resonant the word “States” is  for a reader of Blake. In the same essay he writes: 

Once we read the United States as  belonging to the greatest poem, the race of all races, and we hear  Whitman speaking of Americans throughout the population of Man—every  place and any place and time of Man—then, underlying these United States  and this America, comes a mystery of “America” that belongs to dream  and desire and the reawakening of earliest oneness with all peoples—at  last, the nation of Mankind at large. It is this that informs Whitman’s  enthusiasm for America. In the language of Poetry, of “the greatest  poem,” we rightly read him in the light of Blake’s visions of America,  direful as they are, the States are seen by the poet as states of Man,  and what is happening in the Revolution happens, in Blake’s world, not  because the colonies are English but because they are colonies of Man.  The drama he reads in his figures of fire and outrage and imprisonment  and volcanic release is a drama “of all nations at any time upon the  earth.”Duncan, “Changing Perspectives in Reading Whitman” 170-71.
 
Taking his cue from Blake, Duncan uses the word “States” to describe  the political and poetic character of America. “States” refers to the  governmental organization of America, the Blakean contraries of “Heaven”  and “Hell,” the Whitmanesque “Ideal” and “Actual,” and the states of  Blake’s fourfold vision, which combines reason and imagination, sense  and emotion. Duncan would also have known of Blake’s claim that “the Imagination is not a State: it is the Human Existence itself.”William Blake, Milton pl. 32*, Milton a Poem and the Final Illuminated Works,  ed. with introductions and notes by Robert N. Essick and Joseph Viscomi  (Princeton: Princeton University Press/William Blake Trust, 1993).  His reference to “the actuality of These States” therefore exploits the  Blakean resonance of changing vision. Whitman’s “Wedding,” like Blake’s  Marriage, suggests tension and distance as well as mutual  opening, exchange, and bond. Duncan’s philosophic commitment to the  Blakean mantra “Without Contraries is no progression” gives an  optimistic urgency to his reading of Whitman. It is no accident that  Duncan returns insistently to the moment of touch. As for D. H. Lawrence, who called for a Whitmanesque “democracy of touch” in Lady Chatterley’s Lover, the moment of touch was always charged with political and ethical meaning.D. H. Lawrence, Lady Chatterley’s Lover  (1928; London: Penguin, 1994) 75. Lawrence’s “democracy of touch”  echoes the ideas put forward in his essay on “Democracy” (1919), where  he argues for a restoration of Whitman’s democratic vision, which he  defines as “a struggle to liberate human beings from the fixed,  arbitrary control of ideals, into free spontaneity” (“Democracy,” Reflections on the Death of a Porcupine and Other Essays, ed. Michael Herbert [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988] 61-83 [quotation at 78]).  Touch defines influence; touch defines marriage; touch defines the  poetic gesture implied in “something equivalent to creation”; and touch  defines the imperative demand that will not leave you alone. Duncan’s  focus on touch provides a way of thinking about the relationship between  hermetic vision and political engagement because it draws our attention  to the permeable boundary between self and other.
 
Writing from Myth: Blake’s Influence and the Texture of Experience
 
If the binary of self and other seems too rigid and modish, I find my  use of it redeemed somewhat by Duncan’s own claim that the “fictional form operates to move the poet and the reader into an ‘other’ space in the reality of which actual space fades.”Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth” 29.  Otherness, for Duncan, suggests a creative range of meaning and  possibility and a textured density of experience. The binary therefore  resists static interpretation. Its terms are complex, but this  complexity serves to intensify rather than unbind their structural  opposition.
 
The insistent touch of the other, or “poetry … ‘imperatively  demanded,’” is described in “The Truth and Life of Myth” as the basis  for an understanding of poetry as an embodied medium: “The  mythic content comes to us, commanding the design of the poem; it calls  the poet into action, and with whatever lore and craft he has prepared  himself for that call, he must answer to give body in the poem to the  formative will.”Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth” 13.  The bias that Duncan places on this idea of the poet as a romantic  prophet-artist, speaking the truth of myth, lies in his sense of what it  means to “give body in the poem.” The first thing to understand is that  poetics, for Duncan, introduces an interface between the body as a  poetic text and the poetic text as a body. In other words, the poetic  text, summoned by the “formative will,” is inextricable from the texture  of experience.
 
Before I elaborate on the way that this thinking conditions Duncan’s reading of Blake in Roots and Branches and Fictive Certainties,  it is necessary to understand more about the terms on which he came to  know of the English painter-poet—and to admire him as much as he did. Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century readings of Blake frequently characterized him as an occult or mystic poet.See, for example, Yeats and Ellis, Aleister Crowley, Theodore Roethke, and H.D.  Raised by theosophists, Duncan came naturally to a vocabulary of  correspondences. His adoptive parents were followers of Madame  Blavatsky, avid readers of Swedenborg, and devotees of the occult.  Duncan explains their faith: 

For my parents, the truth of  things was esoteric (locked inside) or occult (masked by the apparent),  and one needed a “lost” key in order to piece out the cryptogram of who  wrote Shakespeare or who created the universe and what his real message  was. From the theosophy of the 1890s my maternal grandmother had passed  from Spiritualism to become an elder in an Hermetic Brotherhood, similar  to and contemporaneous with the Order of the Golden Dawn to which Yeats  belonged. Not only stories and books, but dreams and life itself, were  to be read in terms of contained and revealed messages, even as in our  time works of art, dreams and daily life are read by devotees of  psychoanalysis, or as the People of the Book—Jews, Christians and  Moslems—have always read God’s intent in the world, in history, and  whatever written record. For theosophists, psychoanalysts, and the  converts of revealed religions, it is not the story that is primary but  the meaning behind the story.Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth” 3.
 
For Duncan, the problem with this approach arises out of the very  nature of narrative appreciation, whereby the sensitive mind is opened  to the nuances of human emotion and interaction: “The truth of a story is not rooted in wisdom but in the sense of the drama of life.”Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth” 4. Here again, we see the way his thinking developed along lines compatible with, and influenced by, Olson, who also claims: “[the  stance of projective verse] may, the way things look, lead to a new  poetics and to new concepts from which some sort of drama, say, or of  epic, perhaps, may emerge.”Olson 3. Duncan explains: “As  I continue to be involved with the reading of Plato, not only myth but  truth itself is disturbing, the actuality of time itself disturbed by  the reality of what is happening.”Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth” 5.  Although Duncan thought in terms of correspondence, he was well aware  of the disruptive nature such correspondence could take, and the  vocabulary of dramatic action was one way of expressing the human  significance of that disruption.
 
Blake was a key player in Duncan’s conscious exploration of  derivation and poetic expression. Duncan’s sense that events and  individual poems happen as expressions of an ultimate poetry that  disturbs the actuality of time with the reality of what is happening at  its core bears close relation to his sense of Blake’s inspirational  quality. In “Man’s Fulfillment in Order and Strife,” Duncan claims: “We  must go beyond the sincere into the fiction whose authors, Blake tells  us, are in Eternity. We must set up in the midst of the truth of What  Is, the truth of what we imagine.”Duncan, “Man’s Fulfillment in Order and Strife,” Fictive Certainties 112.  The particular implications of the reference to Blake, itself the  starting point for Duncan’s “Variations on Two Dicta of William Blake,”  will be discussed in more detail later in this section. But there is a  general sense in which Duncan’s claim illustrates the kind of visionary  poet he thought Blake was and the work that such poetry could do in the  modern world. It is essential that “the truth of what we imagine” is to  be set up “in the midst of the truth of What Is.” As with Blake, the  place and purpose of Duncan’s visionary poetics are always intrinsic to  the world of events.
 
Duncan received from his occultist parents an education that  encouraged him to read poetry as a sign system that enclosed, in however  difficult a manner, spiritual truths. But he was equally concerned to  sustain individual freedoms and the idiosyncracies of present identities  in combination with a lasting sense of eternal truth or meaning. He put  it brilliantly in “Towards an Open Universe”: “Our  consciousness, and the poem as a supreme effort of consciousness, comes  in a dancing organization between personal and cosmic identity.”Duncan, “Towards an Open Universe,” Fictive Certainties 78. 

Duncan’s “Variations on Two Dicta of William Blake”Duncan, “Variations on Two Dicta of William Blake,” Roots and Branches 48-53. works precisely because Blake’s aphoristic style (as used in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,  for example) has a deceptive simplicity and universal applicability  that allow Duncan to sustain the “dancing organization,” in this case  expressed through the metaphor of musical variations, of his poem. One  of the fundamental creative principles of musical variation is the  plainness of the original tune. Musical variations allow for the  exploration of register. You can move from the sublime to the ridiculous  by radical changes in musical accompaniment, but the melody will still  be recognizable. Similarly, the aphoristic (if not straightforward)  quality of Blake’s lines allows Duncan to explore what they might mean  in different moods, contexts, and modes of being. Like a melody, the  dicta provide the basis for an exploration of register. Like a musical  accompaniment, Duncan’s tone is constantly shifting around them.  Duncan’s attraction to variation is that of Hermes, god of poets and  thieves. A good composer comes into his own creativity more completely  in the presence of others. Duncan draws his poetic power from the same  activity. It is not just what Blake says but the way he says it that  stimulates Duncan’s meditation on the texture of experience. In the  claim they lay to the absolute, the dicta “Mental Things are alone Real”  (from A Vision of the Last Judgment) and “the Authors are in  Eternity” (from Blake’s letter to Thomas Butts, 6 July 1803) also invite  an interrogation of their status in the compromised conditions of  living life. These conditions make up the drama that Duncan finds  lacking in a mythopoeic imagination that focuses only on wisdom and  truth. It is here that the dialogue he has with Blake starts to creep  toward the ethical, as his poem engages with the actuality of human  suffering as part of the poetic texture of experience.
 
One of the most poignant moments in Duncan’s poem occurs at the start of the second section. 

How long dare I withhold myself my Lord withholds.  I shy a glance that he too shies. The authors of the look write with our eyes broken phrases of their book.
 Examining the shared emotional positions of devotion and desire, Duncan  explores the implication that Blake’s dictum “the Authors are in  Eternity” has for human beings. The scene pivots on an uneasy  negotiation of authorial agency. The self-will, volition, and trembling  energy of the first line both compromise and are compromised by cosmic  writing. In “The Truth and Life of Myth,” Duncan not only implies  admiration and support of Blake’s dictum, he goes as far as to suggest  it as a basis for understanding his poetic texture. Here, Duncan shows  us the darker side of the mythopoeic vision. This is about disconnect  and distance longing to be bridged. There is distance in the opening act  of withholding and there is also distance between the authors and the  actors, who are paradoxically striving for authorship of their actions. 
Throughout the poem, touch is both the desired cohesive  function—“touch, touch, / complete me such a world as I contain”—and  something that true cohesion would inevitably transcend as otherness  becomes an inescapable part of being. 

I recognized in you my own presence beyond touch, within being. What could I reach, reacht as I was?  The authors are in eternity.
 Duncan makes this tension the modus operandi of his poetic engagement. 
I am the author of the authors and I am here. I do not dare rescue myself in you or you in me.
 One could take from this poem a sense that authorship is both surrender  and command. What I take from it is a sense that appreciation of the  possibility of such poetics must also be combined with sensitivity to  the human position. So, Duncan oscillates between an attitude that  connects Blake with a Whitmanesque delight in the natural and cosmic man  (“such a world as I contain” surely evokes Whitman’s celebratory “I  contain multitudes”) and an attitude that acknowledges the tension and  constraint inherent in dictation and the importance of existential  variation. What is real, for Duncan, is felt as real, returning us again to the significance of touch as we are then touched by the suffering, separated lovers. 
So, Blake affects Duncan’s meditation on the texture of experience  not only because his aphorisms provide the textual basis for poetic  variation but also because, as a vital figure in Duncan’s conscious  exploration of poetic derivation, he contributes to the problems that  Duncan perceives in his own poetic process of becoming. These problems  center on the desire for touch and the paradoxical awareness that touch  confirms the externality of the other and does not go far enough.  “Variations on Two Dicta of William Blake” ends: 

We wait, two Others, outside ever our eternal being  That is  here, in this sad tableau too, (for us, unwilling actors) rapture.  The authors are in eternity  That is  in thought intensely between us, restraint that acknowledges  the lover’s kiss.
 In the poem’s final scene, self is relegated to the position of other.  Duncan’s explorations of the meaning of Blake’s dicta in different  registers of experience—registers that include such polar extremes as  “Come, eyes, see more than you see! / For the world within and the outer  world / rejoice as one” and “You talkd of ‘freedom’, / and I saw / how  foreign I am from me”—finally arrive at an embrace that is conditioned  by separation. Moreover, the feeling of separation is derived from the  paradoxical inaccessibility and direct imposition of myth “That is / in  thought intensely between us.” Duncan’s line breaks intensify the gulf  through the suspension of breath while at the same time indicating a  gasping desire for it to be bridged. 
The “restraint that acknowledges / the lover’s kiss” leads us to a  further affinity in the attention that Blake and Duncan pay to formal  boundaries. Both delight in the poetic binding of their productions at  the very moment that they explore notions of freedom and expression.  Both are simultaneously bound to form and bound to unlocking it. An  example can be found in Blake’s “The Garden of Love”:
 
I went to the Garden of Love. And saw what I never had seen: A Chapel was built in the midst, Where I used to play on the green.  And the gates of this Chapel were shut, And Thou shalt not, writ over the door; So I turn’d to the Garden of Love, That so many sweet flowers bore,  And I saw it was filled with graves, And tomb-stones where flowers should be: And Priests in black gowns, were walking their rounds, And binding with briars, my joys and desires.Blake, “The Garden of Love,” pl. 44, Songs of Innocence and of Experience, ed. Lincoln.
 This poem gains its power from the pleasurable nature of the binding  rhymes and rhythms, which deliberately conflict with the subject matter.  As a poet, Duncan, like Blake, understood the vital possibility of  constraint. Blake cannot do without the “briars” in the last line. “The  Garden of Love” wears this symbolic crown of thorns in its formal  constraints. This poem makes a far more subtle point than the one  frequently attributed to it. It is not simply about the evils of  organized religion; it is also about Blake’s poetic debt to  organization. The choreography is unsettling because the verse mimics  the encircling motion of the priests. While the narrative suggests  condemnation of the church, the poetry participates in a necessary  sacrifice of freedom to artistic form. Blake knew that lineaments are  necessary to produce good art. In the mature work of Jerusalem, he aligns outline with “Visions of Imagination.”Blake, Jerusalem pl. 74, Jerusalem, ed. with introduction and notes by Morton D. Paley (Princeton: Princeton University Press/William Blake Trust, 1991). 
This is not to say that Blake is writing in support of the church.  Clearly this would be absurd. It would also make the poem much weaker.  But the poem does display the deep ambivalence that characterizes his  attitude toward boundaries and the nature of the relationship he creates  between freedom and form. Of course such a relationship draws attention  to different kinds of form. There is a difference between the  oppressive form of the church of history and the enabling form of  artistic imagination. But Blake, like Duncan, is not blind to the points  of contact. The “briars” find their echo in the “desires” of the same  line. On the one hand this encourages an interpretation of oppressive  authority limiting the passions. But it also implies equivalence; it  hints that “briars” are, in some way, “desires” or desired. Blake sets  up a carefully choreographed dance between freedom and form, the eternal  world of spirit and the present world of bodies and facts. Boundaries  are about relationship, but they can also be about imposition and  constraint. The trembling hands in Duncan’s “Variations on Two Dicta of William Blake”See section 7, lines 5-7 (Roots and Branches 52).  denote one such boundary; the stifling restrictions of party politics  and organized religion denote the other. The point of contact can be  summarized in the varied experience of touch, which ranges from caress  to attack.
 
Duncan’s “My Mother Would Be a Falconress” deploys a rhythm that,  like the bird it describes, reaches out toward the dangerous  circumference of its being while retaining an anchor in the familiar.  Let’s take the opening stanza: 

My mother would be a falconress, And I, her gay falcon treading her wrist, would fly to bring back from the blue of the sky to her, bleeding, a prize, where I dream in my little hood with many bells jangling when I’d turn my head.Duncan, “My Mother Would Be a Falconress,” Bending the Bow (New York: New Directions, 1968) 52-54.
 The rhythm created by the repetition of “I” (echoed in “fly,” “sky,” and  softened and modified in “I’d”), the alliterative “bring back … blue …  bleeding … bells,” “would … where … when,” and the modification of sound  in “falconress” and “wrist,” “hood” and “head,” bind the breath that is  thrown forth in a projective reading of this verse with the memory and  echo of sounds that have already been uttered. The echoing repetitions  and variations create a strong incantatory rhythm rooted in the familiar  that exists in vital conflict with the momentary bid for freedom  represented in the falcon’s flight and rhythmically suggested by the  poem’s push outwards. There is, of course, a beautiful symmetry with the  subject matter. The falcon’s flight is dictated by the falconress. He  not only flies at her bidding, he goes to do her murderous work. And he  also draws blood from her. The boundaries of his flight are therefore  defined by blood. The edges are dangerous, vicious; they are also a  necessary condition for movement. 
Duncan’s and Blake’s shared preoccupation with boundary, with the  tangible, bloody evidence of birds and briars, starts to map the common  ground in their sense of vision. To “set up in the midst of the truth of  What Is, the truth of what we imagine” breeds conflict. The penetrative  mobility between the present and the eternal and between form and  freedom is a basis for understanding poetics as a hermeneutic of the  world of relationships and binary oppositions. In the following section I  will suggest that the concerns I have been talking about in Roots and Branches become overtly political in Bending the Bow. This is evident not only in the penetrative violence of “My Mother Would Be a Falconress,” which Duncan wrote after nights reading Blake’s bloody images of rape in Visions of the Daughters of Albion,Duncan, “A Lammas Tiding,” Bending the Bow 51. but also in Duncan’s “Up Rising,” which is itself indebted to Blake’s America, and in his more general introductory remarks on the grotesque state of American democracy.
 
Poetic Lore and Political Engagement
 
One way of understanding the interface that Blake and Duncan set up  between personal, poetic, and political formation is through the idea of  the grotesque, a form that embodies an uncomfortable otherness. For Geoffrey Harpham, the word “designates a condition of being just out of focus, just beyond the reach of language.”Geoffrey Galt Harpham, On the Grotesque: Strategies of Contradiction in Art and Literature (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1982) 3.  The grotesque belongs to the liminal realm. The scene is one of  metamorphosis or transition, the self’s process of becoming, its fight  with an excess of self that it would like to name other. The grotesque  form is consequently at odds with itself. Harpham describes it as  indicative of an idea too big for form, but it seems to me to be  precisely the integral and constitutive relationship between form and  idea that makes it such a useful concept to apply to the points of  contact between Duncan and Blake. The grotesque form gives the  appearance of struggle precisely because it is so difficult to combine  two dissonant modes of being in a single formal expression. But,  precisely because of its uncomfortable dissonance, it is a useful theory  with which to read these poets’ conceptions of self (in dialogue or  romance with the self’s own emanations, influences, and otherness),  poetry (expressive of a greater poetics), and politics (as related to  normative and deviant notions of individual and national behavior).
 
In his introduction to Bending the Bow, Duncan writes: 

We enter again and again the last days of our own  history, for everywhere living productive forms in the evolution of  forms fail, weaken, or grow monstrous, destroying the terms of their  existence. We do not mean an empire; a war then, as if to hold all China  or the ancient sea at bay, breaks out at a boundary we name ours.  It is a boundary beyond our understanding. Now, where other nations  before us have flounderd, we flounder. To defend a form that our very  defense corrupts. We cannot rid ourselves of the form to which we now  belong. And in this drama of our own desperation we are drawn into a  foreign desperation. For our defense has invaded an area of our selves  that troubled us. Cities laid waste, villages destroyd, men, women and  children hunted down in their fields, forests poisond, herds of  elephants screaming under our fire—it is all so distant from us we hear  only what we imagine, making up what we surely are doing. When in  moments of vision I see back of the photographt details and the daily  body counts actual bodies in agony and hear—what I hear now is the  desolate bellowing of some ox in a ditch—madness starts up in me. The pulse of this sentence beats before and beyond all proper bounds and we no longer inhabit what we thought properly our own.Duncan, Bending the Bow i.
 In this rendering of the grotesque, or “monstrous,” contemporary  condition, it is both impossible and undesirable to ignore the  slipperiness with which Duncan shifts between political, personal, and  poetic positions, emphasizing their interdependence. For if this passage  is a description of contemporary American democracy, which has  compromised itself by its aggressive actions in Vietnam, it is also a  psychological exploration of this condition at an individual level (“our  defense has invaded an area of our selves that troubled us”) and a  meditation on the poetics of experience (“the pulse of this sentence  beats before and beyond all proper bounds”). 
Theorizing about the grotesque, Margrit Shildrick suggests that “we  are always and everywhere vulnerable precisely because the monstrous is  not only an exteriority. … what is at issue is the permeability of the  boundaries that guarantee the normatively embodied self.”Margrit Shildrick, Embodying the Monster: Encounters with the Vulnerable Self (London: Sage, 2002) 1.  As the otherness of the grotesque is poetically encoded or figuratively  embodied in the normative self, the relation between self and other is  such that “the encounter with the strange is not a  discrete event but the constant condition of becoming.” “Both are in  play, then,” she argues, “on a plane where conceptual logics cannot be  distinguished from the corporeality of becoming in the world.”Shildrick 1.  To make this less abstract we might consider the way that Blake and  Duncan present the body, and particularly the differential body (gay,  black, gendered), as intrinsic to the ontological and ethical processes  of self and nation. As Duncan’s opening to Bending the Bow  illustrates, when the monstrous becomes a way of reflecting on the self,  it is at once disturbing and progressive. America’s engorged body  politic refutes the binary of self and other that Duncan perceives to be  driving its actions in Vietnam. Duncan’s presentation of America’s  monstrous democracy therefore demands a reappraisal of normative  identity and a reassessment of political activity.
 
For Shildrick, the grotesque draws attention to the discursive nature  of embodiment and attests to the vulnerability and unpredictability at  the heart of the process of becoming. It is this emphasis on  indeterminacy and process that makes her theory of the grotesque body  interesting in relation to Blake and Duncan. As we have seen, Blake and  Duncan posit the body as a poetic field and poetry as an embodied  medium. Duncan claims: “This poetry, the ever  forming of bodies in language in which breath moves, is a field of  ensouling. Each line, intensely, a soul thing, a contribution; a  locality of the living.”Duncan, Bending the Bow ii.  Blake’s characters are a testament to the discursive nature of  embodiment, their forms created visually by his varied illustrations and  linguistically by the politically charged ways of seeing exemplified in  his skillful manipulations of genre. In Visions of the Daughters of Albion,  a poem that Duncan read repeatedly, the body of Oothoon becomes a locus  for interrogating the sentimental and voyeuristic qualities of feminine  antislavery writing, the association of prophetic utterance with  masculine violence, and the place of the marginalized in poetic speech.  Blake’s and Duncan’s shared sense of poetry as an embodied medium is  evident in the former’s complex cast of mythological characters and the  latter’s repeated emphasis on the poetics of lived (and necessarily  embodied) experience.
 
In Blake’s Visions, the body comes under attack; its  integrity is compromised and its status overdetermined as individual  figures are represented both visually and verbally in multiple and  sometimes contrasting ways. Oothoon, for example,  appears as muddy-colored, light, pinkish, and brown as Blake furthers  his concern with modes of perception and representation.For example, she is brown in object 9 of copy F and pink in object 9 of copy I; dark in object 9 of copy P and light in object 5 of copy A (all in the William Blake Archive).  Our attention is drawn to the idea of threatened boundaries through  forcible bodily penetration. There are multiple rapes. The first clear  rape, carried out by the slaveholder Bromion, deflowers the gentle  Oothoon, “the soft soul of America,” within the first twenty lines of  the poem. The rape is noticeable for its suddenness. Its violence lies  in the breathtaking speed with which it occurs and the amputated nature  of Blake’s description. The verb is monosyllabic. The phrase is abrupt: “Bromion rent her with his thunders.”William Blake, Visions of the Daughters of Albion pl. 4, The Early Illuminated Books,  ed. with introductions and notes by Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and  Joseph Viscomi (Princeton: Princeton University Press/William Blake  Trust, 1993). It stands in stark contrast to the undulating  luscious feminine rhythms of the opening fifteen lines, which describe  the chained sexual passions of England’s women as they “sigh” toward  America. From the opening lines, which refer to the curvaceous  “mountains” and “valleys” of the daughters of Albion, to the  “wander[ing]” of Oothoon as she travels in loose fashion through the  “vales” of Leutha, to her journey over the rolling waves as she moves  toward Theotormon after symbolically plucking the flower from Leutha’s  valley, Blake’s writing dwells on the soft curves and gentle motion  associated with feminine seductive power. The rape by Bromion forces  itself on the poem, halting this flow of feminine allure. Oothoon is left prostrate and still: “on his stormy bed / Lay the faint maid.”Blake, Visions of the Daughters of Albion pl. 4, The Early Illuminated Books, ed. Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi. Oothoon’s immobility heightens the contrast with the wandering movement of earlier lines.
 
In one sense Blake rehearses a rather familiar trope of rape as  colonial domination and possession, aligning the female body with the  land. He takes it further, however, by suggesting a gendering of poetic  utterance. While Oothoon wanders in Leutha’s vale, the poetic movement  is characterized by yearning desire. When she is raped, Blake’s diction  becomes violent and abbreviated. This rape is not the first suggestion  of violence in the poem, nor is it the last. When Oothoon “pluck[s]” the  flower from the valley of Leutha, her action invites comparison with  Bromion’s. This is more than understandable, given the way the loss of  female virginity was described in contemporary literature. In some  cases, the description closely mirrored that of rape. When Fanny Hill loses her virginity in John Cleland’s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, for example, she is subject to “fierce tearing and rending.”Quoted by Caroline Jackson-Houlston, “‘The lineaments of … desire’: Blake’s Visions of the Daughters of Albion and Romantic Literary Treatments of Rape,” Queer Blake, ed. Helen P. Bruder and Tristanne Connolly (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010) 156.  Even as she plucks the flower, Oothoon remains open to sensual  experience. This paradoxical meaning is carried in the sexually  suggestive act of deflowering that simultaneously signals the rejection  of sexual experience. It is important to the voice that Oothoon finds  later in the poem that she retains this openness. Virginity, here, is  not false modesty but innocence and possibility.
 
After Bromion rapes her, Oothoon figuratively calls a second rape upon herself as a means to redemption from the first: 

I call with holy voice! kings of the sounding air, Rend away this defiled bosom that I may reflect, The image of Theotormon on my pure transparent breast.  The Eagles at her call descend and rend their bleeding prey; Theotormon severely smiles. her soul reflects the smile; As the clear spring mudded with feet of beasts grows pure and smiles.Blake, Visions of the Daughters of Albion pl. 5, The Early Illuminated Books, ed. Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi.
 The rape by Bromion turns Oothoon’s body into a cage. This is reflected  in her inability to cry: “Oothoon weeps not. she cannot weep!” Her body  encloses itself and it is only through violent and bloody penetration  that she can unlock it. The following plate accentuates the suggestion  of a second rape. Oothoon lies upon her back, head and arms flung back,  legs slightly splayed and chest lifted up toward the ravenous bird in a  clear indication of sexual invitation. The eagle’s beak protrudes  sharply as, wings splayed in downward flight, he plunges it into  Oothoon’s proffered flesh. 
Oothoon’s summons, “I call with holy voice,” assumes the power of the bard, introduced in the opening to Songs of Experience  as the prophet-artist who “Present, Past, and Future sees.” Oothoon  presents herself as passive, but she has the decisive power of voice,  while Theotormon ineffectively weeps on the threshold. Her voice  occupies the space that Theotormon refuses to fill with love for her.  But without Theotormon’s love and without sexual fulfillment Oothoon’s  words become repetitious: “I cry, Love! Love! Love! happy happy Love!”Blake, Visions of the Daughters of Albion pl. 10, The Early Illuminated Books, ed. Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi.  Her song is iterative, its generative potential frustrated by the bind  of shame that keeps Theotormon from fulfilling her desires.
 
In Blake’s illuminated book, the image of Theotormon’s eagle  penetrating Oothoon appears under his only speech. The juxtaposition of  Theotormon’s passive bemoaning of his own sorrow and his eagle’s violent  activity is striking. The eagle acts as he cannot. Like the daughters  of Albion who can only “weep” and “eccho,” Theotormon denies his own  power for decisive action, existing in a position of liminality that  Oothoon powerfully rejects.
 
Oothoon’s bardic imagination offers another way of seeing, and one  that has a direct bearing on Blake’s own conception of the political  importance of the prophet-artist. Oothoon calls the eagles to rend her  flesh in order that she may “reflect, / The image of Theotormon.” While  her self-inflicted rape is a potently aggressive act of self-harm, it  makes her into a vehicle for truth. She is offering to tell the  suppressed story of the poem and, in bringing the marginalized  Theotormon center stage, she hopes to recover his love. At this moment  Oothoon’s “holy voice” might redeem the status of narrative, which is  under scrutiny in this poem. Her violent act suggests both a  reinscription of her “bleeding” virgin state of openness and possibility  and a reconfiguration of form: 

The Eagles at her call descend and rend their bleeding prey; Theotormon severely smiles. her soul reflects the smile; As the clear spring mudded with feet of beasts grows pure and smiles.
 In this further degradation of her flesh, Oothoon takes on a shifting  color, which makes us think of dark and light skin. In one sense, this  indeterminate color emphasizes the fluid condition of her soul which,  like a “clear spring,” “reflects” Theotormon’s smile. However, it also  configures Oothoon’s love in terms familiar from colonialist discourse.  We see through the eyes of the daughters again as Oothoon’s core appears  white. 
Introducing the prophetic mode in conjunction with tropes familiar  from contemporary antislavery writing furthers Blake’s concern with  modes of seeing and the politics of representation. Oothoon’s cry for  freedom is an attack on received forms of perception: 

Arise my Theotormon I am pure. Because the night is gone that clos’d me in its deadly black. They told me that the night and day were all that I could see; They told me that I had five senses to inclose me up. And they inclos’d my infinite brain into a narrow circle, And sunk my heart into the Abyss, a red round globe hot burning Till all from life I was obliterated and erased.Blake, Visions of the Daughters of Albion pl. 5, The Early Illuminated Books, ed. Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi.
 “They told me,” Oothoon repeats, lamenting the mental chains that taught  her to see nothing other than the time-bound world of sense experience,  to live from day to day guided by physical want and fear. Striking out  against her oppressors, she stakes her claim to freedom in terms that  emphasize her newfound ability to perceive a reality other than the  temporal and locate meaning in figurative language. 
Instead of morn arises a bright shadow, like an eye In the eastern cloud: instead of night a sickly charnel house.Blake, Visions of the Daughters of Albion pl. 5, The Early Illuminated Books, ed. Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi.
 Theotormon, the cause of her present sorrow, remains caged. His ability  to distinguish and find meaning is nullified by shame and grief. 
To him the night and morn Are both alike: a night of sighs, a morning of fresh tears.Blake, Visions of the Daughters of Albion pl. 5, The Early Illuminated Books, ed. Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi.
 
Reading Blake’s Visions in order to find “the poetic lore of  what America is” and writing “My Mother Would Be a Falconress” in a  semi-automatic state, Duncan claimed that he had constructed a poem  about poets: 

And, searching out the poetic lore of what America is, I had been reading Blake’s Vision of the Daughters of Albion these last few nights just before going to sleep. “With what sense is it that the chicken shuns the ravenous hawk?”  I had read, and I said to myself, yes, there are bloody men, and I am  not one of them but of chicken-kind, for I would never draw blood. Which  goes to show one should be careful of vain self-delusions entertaind at  bedtime. For now my dream would have me a hawk. And, hearing my  account, Jess comments: “Especially since chickens do draw blood.”  Whereupon, I recall those horrible cannibalistic hens I tended at  Treesbank, that needed only the first sign of blood that might be left  after egg-laying to tear at each other, bloody not from hunger but from  malice, like so many poets furious in their pecking order.  Do I draw blood then chicken-wise And hide myself in a hawk’s disguise?Duncan, “A Lammas Tiding,” Bending the Bow 51.
 
The vocabulary of violence, which he derives from Blake, relates to  political, poetic, and sexual power. It is political because it is about  the violence of domination and futile aggression, which provides a  rather pointed reflection on America’s actions in Vietnam. When Duncan  writes in “My Mother Would Be a Falconress” “it seemd my human soul went  down in flames,” it is hard to ignore the image of the American fighter  plane crashing into Asian soil. It is poetic because it negotiates the  difficulty of finding a place for individual voice free from the mother  tongue and mothering or smothering forms of language: 

I would be a falcon and go free. I tread her wrist and wear the hood, talking to myself, and would draw blood.
 And it is sexual because of the unsettling evocation of rape where the  gay poet-falcon’s “pierc[ing]” beak implies virginal deflowering as well  as the daily plundering of life. 
Duncan would have known that the Egyptian sun-god, Ra, creator of the  world, had the head of a falcon, and that he symbolically died each  evening, crossing the boundary to the underworld, and was brought back  to life in the morning. He would have been familiar with the ancient  superstition that animals cross between realms more easily. So, for  Duncan, with his defining interest in hermetic vision, choosing the  falconress and falcon to represent the mother-son relationship is  unlikely to have been accidental. Like Blake, he was more than able to  relate cosmic and personal boundaries and boundary crossings on the same  plane. In a clear echo of Blake’s Visions, the violence of Duncan’s poem suggests rape: 

When will she let me bring down the little birds, pierced from their flight with their necks broken, their heads like flowers limp from the stem?
 The deliberate double meaning of “bring down” and “pierced,” together  with the simile in the last line, elides the difference between murder  and deflowering rape. In the next line the pent-up aggression of  Duncan’s poet-falcon turns on the mother, the origin of self, from which  it cannot break free: “I tread my mother’s wrist and would draw blood.”  Duncan takes from Blake the sense that rape can figure both as a symbol  of oppression and as a source of controlling power. He also takes from  Blake a desire to bring violence and ugliness center stage and confront  their meaning and relevance. I have suggested that Blake’s poem opens  our eyes to the possibility of poetic power sourced not in generic  sentimental and sighing visions, but in the disruptive prophetic mode,  vividly rendered in Oothoon’s second, self-willed rape and gloriously  upheld in her discovery of the revelatory and liberating capacity of  figurative language. Duncan is in dialogue with Blake on the  possibilities of freedom through violence and the concomitant notions of  futile henpecking poets and colonial oppression. 
Before I remark on “Up Rising,” I want to venture a few suggestions  as to the connections a mind like Duncan’s or Blake’s, prone to repeated  interfaces, analogies, and discursive ways of imagining, might have  drawn between the penetrative quality of hermetic vision (in which one  might find “the poetic lore of what America is”) and the violent  penetration expressed in their images of rape. Reading “My Mother Would  Be a Falconress,” we are left with a strong sense that if Duncan found a  poetic lore governing the actuality of American society in Blake’s Visions,  it was a lore of grotesque being. In the theoretical framework  established at the start of this section, I suggested that the grotesque  scene is one of metamorphosis or transition, the self’s process of  becoming and its fight with an excess of self that it would like to name  other. As Blake and Duncan posit a discursive interchange between the  body as a poetic field and poetry as an embodied medium, the grotesque  state of the raped body becomes a way of thinking about poetic utterance  and the power of voice. Oothoon claims the unwanted otherness of  Bromion as a part of herself and a source of poetic power when she calls  upon Theotormon’s eagles to rend her flesh. Duncan makes a similarly  uncomfortable move when he brings the falcon’s violence center stage in  his poem.
 
If we return for a moment to the binary of self and other and the  profound awareness of boundary and boundary crossing that I have argued  mattered both to Duncan’s appreciation of Blake and to the broader  poetics of which this appreciation was a part, we can see that otherness  is both an unwelcome and invited intruder on the notion of self and  essential to its formation. Here again, I think there is a very  important sense in which Duncan’s poetry interrogates and problematizes  the claim for visionary poetics that he makes in “Man’s Fulfillment in  Order and Strife.” That is, “We must go beyond  the sincere into the fiction whose authors, Blake tells us, are in  Eternity. We must set up in the midst of the truth of What Is, the truth  of what we imagine.”Duncan, “Man’s Fulfillment in Order and Strife” 112. Duncan makes us think differently about Blake’s dictum because he never lets go of the tension it involves.
 
The eagle is, of course, also a symbol for America. Duncan  consciously inherits Blake’s dialectic between spirit and society,  thinking about the way such penetrative violence might take on a  particular significance in the context of contemporary American foreign  policy. By this I do not mean to suggest that Duncan simply reiterates  the familiar trope of rape as colonial oppression, though to some extent  this trope haunts his writing, as it haunts Blake’s. The rape imagery  in “My Mother Would Be a Falconress” is part of a more abstract poetic  and political concern with threatened boundaries. At the beginning of  this section I cited Duncan’s opening to Bending the Bow, where  he comments on the monstrous state of American democracy: “We enter  again and again the last days of our own history, for everywhere living  productive forms in the evolution of forms fail, weaken, or grow  monstrous, destroying the terms of their existence.” This apocalyptic  sense of an ending lacks the redemptive quality of light that will  emerge out of darkness. Duncan calls the quality of imagination into  question by implicating it as a part of the problem in his opening to Bending the Bow: 

Cities laid waste, villages destroyd, men, women and  children hunted down in their fields, forests poisond, herds of  elephants screaming under our fire—it is all so distant from us we hear  only what we imagine, making up what we surely are doing. When in  moments of vision I see back of the photographt details and the daily  body counts actual bodies in agony and hear—what I hear now is the  desolate bellowing of some ox in a ditch—madness starts up in me. The pulse of this sentence beats before and beyond all proper bounds and we no longer inhabit what we thought properly our own.Duncan, Bending the Bow i.
 The monstrous state of America is reflected in a monstrous poetic that  is blind to the narrative of murder and destruction, blind to a  narrative it does not want to acknowledge. Imagination, in this sense,  is devoid of the penetrating prophetic function that Duncan then  ascribes to “moments of vision.” Such moments, and the “madness” they  generate, threaten the normative identity of the self and force an  ecstatic embodying of the other. 
The poetic that governs Duncan’s engagement with Blake therefore has  direct relevance to the nature of his political engagement. Duncan  castigates contemporary American democracy because it denies this  poetic. He suggests that America’s actions in Vietnam, which reflect the  failing of American foreign policy to consider the way democracy might  resist the violent perpetration of North American hegemony, pervert and  destroy the democratic system that they are meant to protect. They are  fighting “to defend a form that our very defense corrupts.” The impact  of such defense is to close off evolution and destroy the very life and  energy that are essential to the kind of redemptive, restorative, and  ethical democratic vision that Duncan finds in his reading of Whitman,  Blake, and Olson.
 
The relationship between Duncan’s poetic lore and political engagement is reciprocal. “Up Rising”Duncan, “Up Rising,” Passages 25, Bending the Bow 81-83. is one of a series of poems about war originally published as “Passages” in a separate publication titled Of the War.  The war in Vietnam provides a way of thinking about conflict, that is  to say the binary principle that I have argued is fundamental to  Duncan’s poetic texture, just as the binary, the permeable boundary  between self and other, provides a way of thinking about the war that is  happening in Vietnam and the meaning of America, which is under  scrutiny as a result. In “Up Rising,” Blake features as a writer of  hermetic vision who offers a way of imagining the fundamental principles  of America as they appeared at the moment of national inception, “in  figures of fire and blood raging.” But the following line begins “… in  what image?” as if Blake’s “figures” can’t fully embody the violence and  horror of an America grown so fat on its own despotic idea of democracy  that its “ravening eagle” knows no bounds and cannot satiate its  destructive hunger for human flesh. The horror that Duncan perceives in  contemporary foreign policy tests the principle of hermetic vision even  as it contributes to his understanding of the texture and meaning of  such vision through struggle and conflict.
 
Conclusions
 
The lament that opens Bending the Bow mourns the destruction  of form as evolutionary process and discursive embodiment. Such form  attests to the importance of permeable boundaries and an ethic rooted in  the relationship between self and other. We have seen how and why Blake  mattered to Duncan in this context, in terms of both poetic texture and  political engagement, and how Duncan makes us think differently about  Blake’s dicta and violence as a result. Duncan comes into his creative  potential thinking about Blake in terms of touch. And touch defines the  boundary of self both by reinscribing it as a real and tangible  distinction and by offering a way of transgressing that distinction. In  this way Duncan takes our understanding of Blake beyond the personal and  poetic implications of myth toward an intensely ethical and political  engagement.
 
The dialogue that Duncan has with Blake is part of a larger pattern  in Blake’s American reception, where the English poet-painter both  matters to a Whitmanesque tradition of mythic self-definition and helps  expose the tensions inherent in that tradition. For Duncan, poetry, and  particularly the romantic prophet-artist, needed to address and restore  the meaning of American democracy. Filtered through Olson’s lens, Blake  becomes part of the restoration of a Whitmanesque dream. Contemporary  democracy, with its troubling exclusion of the other and a perceived  tendency toward individual stultification as opposed to liberation and  expansion, seems monstrous by comparison. In his experiment in  life-writing, titled The H.D. Book, Duncan claimed: “Where  a democracy is composed of a people in which the individual conscience  and nature is not liberated, so that a common standard or consensus of  the majority rules and not the union of each in free volition, the state  is already totalitarian.”“From The H.D. Book, Part II, Chapter 5,” Sagetrieb: Robert Duncan Special Issue 4.2-3 (fall and winter 1985): 42-43.  Duncan maintains the importance of the prophet-artist in the  preservation of democratic individualism at a time when the very values  of democracy and community seem hijacked by commercial and technocratic  interest. He writes: 

The beauty of the poem, the  poet’s sense of beauty, in itself, that cannot be bought and sold.  Beauty, in a society based upon commodity-profit is ambivalently praised  and despised. The popular mistrust, the industrial and commercial  mistrust, opposes and destroys where it can individual sensitivity, as  out of place in the “democracy” of big party politics or in the  “community” of the modern city as individualist architecture with its  romantic and expressive form, even ornament, is in the plans of the new  functionalism.“From The H.D. Book, Part II, Chapter 5” 49.
 Duncan’s use of quotation marks around “democracy” and “community”  indicates the corruption of the terms he holds in such high esteem. For  it is in democracy and community realized in the intimacy and density of  his poetry that Duncan finds hope for society. And while it is fair to  say that he participates in the making of an American myth of Blake that  is fundamentally optimistic in its desire to co-opt the English  painter-poet into a restorative romantic vision, Duncan is also  sensitive to the limitations of that vision and, like Blake and Whitman,  he has doubts as to the capability of the prophet-artist to work within society and effect social change.Whitman’s concerns appear strongest in his 1871 work Democratic Vistas. Blake’s anxieties surface throughout his canon but perhaps the best example is in Vala, where the prophetic function is recognized as a “delusive Phantom.” “… in what image?” he asks his admired Blake, can we begin to embody and therefore address the grotesque state of our nation? 
After Duncan published Bending the Bow he pledged to keep  away from the world of publication for fifteen years. His friend and  contemporary poet Michael Palmer explained the decision in the following  way: 

The story is well-known in poetry  circles: around 1968, disgusted by his difficulties with publishers and  by what he perceived as the careerist strategies of many poets, Duncan  vowed not to publish a new collection for fifteen years. (There would be  chapbooks along the way.) He felt that this decision would free him to  listen to the demands of his (supremely demanding) poetics and would  liberate the architecture of his work from all compromised  considerations.Michael Palmer, “Ground Work: On Robert Duncan,” http://​jacketmagazine.​com/​29/​palmer-duncan.​html (last accessed 19 July 2011).
 This move reveals “My Mother Would Be a Falconress” to be as much about  Duncan’s frustrations at restrictions on his poetic freedom as it is  homage to the revelatory power of the prophetic voice. Perhaps in  retreating from publication, and therefore implicitly from society,  Duncan felt he could better serve it in the end. But such a move also  illustrates an inability to realize the dialectic between spirit and  society that was fundamental to his sense of himself as a poet of  hermetic vision, and also to his identification with Blake. This anxiety  haunts Duncan’s reading of Blake, as perhaps it haunts the Whitmanesque  myth of America that Blake helps Duncan reimagine, shadowing the  visionary enterprise with the struggle and disillusionment felt by the  very poets who most wanted to sustain it.

The Responses of William Blake and Joseph Priestley to Two Swedenborgian Ideas
 
By J. B. Mertz
 
J. B. Mertz (jeffrey_mertz@hotmail.com)  is an adjunct professor of English at Lindenwood University. He is  currently preparing an article about Blake’s works of the mid-1790s and  the publications of Joseph Johnson.
 
 
  
As a “prerequisite to attendance”I  am grateful to G. E. Bentley, Jr., Bryonie Carter, Brendan Fleming, and  this journal’s anonymous reader for their comments on a draft of this  article. at the general conference of the New Jerusalem Church in  April 1789, William Blake and his wife, Catherine, signed a document  stating the following: 

We whose Names are hereunto  subscribed, do each of us approve of the Theological Writings of Emanuel  Swedenborg, believing that the Doctrines contained therein are genuine  Truths, revealed from Heaven, and that the New Jerusalem Church ought to  be established, distinct and separate from the Old Church.G. E. Bentley, Jr., Blake Records, 2nd ed. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) 50.
 Given the Blakes’ association with the New Jerusalem Church in 1789, it  is tempting to argue that the critique of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772)  in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (possibly completed as early as the final months of 1790)There is disagreement about the date of completion of The Marriage.  The traditional dating of 1790-93 derives mainly from David Erdman’s  argument regarding how Blake formed the lowercase letter “g” in various  works (whether with a conventional ear or an idiosyncratic leftward ear  on the upper bowl of the letter). See David V. Erdman, “Dating Blake’s  Script: The ‘g’ Hypothesis,” Blake 3.1 (1969): 8-13. As Joseph Viscomi observes, The Marriage  does not refer to literary works or historical events that can be dated  later than 1790, and copy F contains Blake’s handwritten reference to  the year 1790 above the text on plate 3. See Joseph Viscomi, Blake and the Idea of the Book  (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993) 233-34 and 237. Further  arguments for 1790 as the year of completion can be found in Viscomi,  “The Evolution of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,” Huntington Library Quarterly 58 (1997): 284-85; Viscomi, “The Lessons of Swedenborg; or, The Origin of William Blake’s The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,” Lessons of Romanticism: A Critical Companion, ed. Thomas Pfau and Robert F. Gleckner (Durham: Duke University Press, 1998) 176-81; and William Blake, The Early Illuminated Books,  ed. Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi (Princeton:  Princeton University Press/William Blake Trust, 1993) 113-15. For a  detailed argument that The Marriage “made its first public appearance in 1793 rather than 1790,” see William Blake, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, ed. with an introduction and commentary by Michael Phillips (Oxford: Bodleian Library, 2011) 32-44 (quotation at 42). anticipates Joseph Priestley’s expostulation with the Swedenborgians in his Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church. (Priestley’s Letters were not published until the second half of 1791, delayed several weeks by the mob’s burning of his home in Birmingham.)See Joseph Priestley, Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church, Formed by Baron Swedenborg (Birmingham, 1791) iv-v. While Jon Mee has pointed out that Priestley’s “rationalism is often presented as making [him] irrelevant to Blake studies,”Jon Mee, Dangerous Enthusiasm: William Blake and the Culture of Radicalism in the 1790s (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992) 6.  I should like to explore what seem to be meaningful similarities  between the responses of Blake and Priestley to specific details of  Swedenborg’s writing. 
An important early juxtaposition of The Marriage and Priestley appears in John Howard’s essay on Blake and Swedenborgianism: “The Marriage  was not the sole attack on the Swedenborgians; Blake was joined by  other members of the [Joseph] Johnson circle, and by Joseph Priestl[e]y  in particular.”John Howard, “An Audience for The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,” Blake Studies 3 (1970): 23. However, it might be more accurate to view The Marriage  in the broader context of Priestley’s long-standing campaign against  corruptions and error in Christianity, as Marilyn Butler proposes: “The satirical attack of The Marriage  draws strength from the political, intellectual leadership offered by  the whole of Priestley’s career, that thirty-year campaign in favour of  individualism and against priestcraft, authority, and ‘corruptions.’”Marilyn Butler, Romantics, Rebels and Reactionaries: English Literature and Its Background, 1760-1830 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1981) 47. Blake’s language in The Marriage does exhibit notable affinities with Priestley’s earlier Disquisitions Relating to Matter and Spirit (1777), as Morton Paley and Graham Pechey have observed.Paley suggests that “Priestley’s denial of the dichotomy of soul and body” in Disquisitions is a view “very close” to that expressed by Blake’s “voice of the Devil” (Energy and the Imagination: A Study of the Development of Blake’s Thought  [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1970] 8-9). Pechey traces Blake’s polemic  “against the dichotomies of metaphysics which inform [Swedenborg’s]  discourse” to Disquisitions (“The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: A Text and Its Conjuncture,” Oxford Literary Review 3 [1979]: 57). In Disquisitions as well as An History of the Corruptions of Christianity (1782), Priestley argues against an immaterial soul existing independent of the body. He  maintains that “we have no reason to suppose that there are in man two  substances so distinct from each other” as “matter” and “spirit,” and  seeks to demonstrate that “the doctrine of a soul is altogether unphilosophical, and unscriptural.”Priestley, Disquisitions Relating to Matter and Spirit.  To Which Is Added the History of the Philosophical Doctrine Concerning  the Origin of the Soul, and the Nature of Matter; with Its Influence on  Christianity, Especially with Respect to the Doctrine of the  Pre-existence of Christ, 2nd ed. (Birmingham, 1782) 1: ii, 270 (emphasis in original). In both works, he suggests the derivative nature of the soul, i.e., he always speaks of the “soul distinct from the body,”Priestley, Disquisitions 1: 271-72, 278. See also An History of the Corruptions of Christianity (Birmingham, 1782) 1: 330, 345. while in The Marriage Blake twice avers that man has no “body distinct from his soul,” as if partly affirming and partly amending Priestley.The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, ed. David V. Erdman, newly rev. ed. (New York: Anchor–Random House, 1988) [hereafter “E”] 34, pl. 4, and 39, pl. 14. Mee observes that “the proximity of [Priestley’s] language [in Corruptions of Christianity] to Blake’s on Plate 4 of The Marriage suggests that Priestley may well have been a direct source in this instance.”Mee 138. It should be emphasized, however, that Blake may just as well have known these concepts from Priestley’s Disquisitions. See note 7, above.
 
Notwithstanding critical observations of affinities between Blake’s  and Priestley’s language, two Swedenborgian ideas to which Blake and  Priestley both respond in The Marriage and Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church seem to have been overlooked: Swedenborg’s contention that there is no space in the spiritual worldSee Emanuel Swedenborg, The Wisdom of Angels, Concerning Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, [trans. Nathaniel Tucker] (London, 1788) nn. 7-10 and 69-72. Blake’s annotations to these sections of Divine Love and Divine Wisdom  do not indicate any immediate disagreement with Swedenborg’s ideas of  space. Howard discusses Blake’s criticism of Swedenborg’s idea of space  in connection with Priestley’s Letters, but solely in terms of Swedenborg’s ignorance of Georgium Sidus (the planet Uranus), which was discovered by William Herschel in 1781 (Howard 47-48). and his claim to have seen God.In an extract from True Christian Religion  read at the opening of the general conference of the New Jerusalem  Church, Swedenborg defends his “Memorable Relations” against the charge  “that they are the Fictions of Imagination” by claiming, “it hath  pleased the Lord to manifest Himself to me, and to send me to teach the  Things relating to his New Church” (Anon., Minutes of a General  Conference of the Members of the New Church, Signified by the New  Jerusalem in the Revelation: Held in Great East Cheap, London, from the  13th to the 17th of April, 1789 [London, 1789] 16). See also proposition XL: “This Second Coming of the Lord is effected by Means of his Servant Emanuel Swedenborg, before whom he hath manifested himself in Person” (Minutes 29).  In the fourth “Memorable Fancy,” after Blake’s narrating devil and his  “friend the Angel” have visited “the infinite Abyss” and the mill at the  end of a “church vault” (E 41-42, pls. 17-19), the devil proposes to  show the angel his “eternal lot”: 

he laughd at my proposal: but I by force suddenly caught  him in my arms, and flew westerly thro’ the night, till we were  elevated above the earths shadow: then I flung myself with him directly  into the body of the sun, here I clothed myself in white, and taking  in my hand Swedenborgs volumes sunk from the glorious clime, and passed  all the planets till we came to saturn, here I staid to rest and then  leap’d into the void, between saturn and the fixed stars. Here said I! is your lot, in this space, if space it may be calld. (E 42, pl. 19)
 The angel dismisses the episode as a “phantasy” imposed upon him (E 42,  pl. 20), but Blake’s description of outer space, including “the earths  shadow,” “the body of the sun,” “the planets,” “saturn,” and “the fixed  stars,” together with his mocking reference to “space, if space it may  be calld,” suggests the absurdity of Swedenborg’s claim that “in the spiritual world there are not spaces, but appearances of spaces.”Swedenborg, The Delights of Wisdom Respecting Conjugal Love. After Which Follow the Pleasures of Insanity Respecting Scortatory Love, [trans. Henry Servanté] (London, 1790) n. 50. Priestley answers Swedenborg’s claims respecting space by noting that “it is impossible for us to exclude the ideas of space, or duration”Priestley, Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church 49 (emphasis in original). from the idea of God, and also suggests that Swedenborg has mistaken his dreams for visions: 
His idea of there being no space  in the spiritual world, but only the appearance of it, was suggested to  him by what was represented to his mind in those visions. For,  continuing in the same place, he fancied himself to be transported to a  great distance, and after conversing with the inhabitants of one world,  he sometimes instantly found himself in another. All this passing in his  own mind, he naturally concluded, that the objects which seemed to  occupy real space, in what he calls the Spiritual World … had no real bulk, but only the appearance of it.Priestley, Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church 52 (emphasis in original).
 While Blake bluntly ridicules Swedenborg and Priestley attempts to  account rationally for Swedenborg’s claim, both nonetheless identify as  problematic a specific idea in Swedenborg’s writing. 
Although the similarity with Priestley is somewhat weaker in this  instance, the discussion between Blake’s devil and the prophets seems to  answer the claim that God “hath manifested himself in Person” to Swedenborg.See note 13, above. In The Marriage, Blake’s narrator demands of Ezekiel and Isaiah 

how they dared so roundly to assert. that God spake to  them; and whether they did not think at the time, that they would be  misunderstood, and so be the cause of imposition. Isaiah answer’d. I saw no God. nor  heard any, in a finite organical perception; but my senses discover’d  the infinite in every thing. (E 38, pl. 12)
 To assert that God “spake” to the prophets is obviously not the same  thing as Swedenborg’s claim, but in both cases God communicates  personally and directly with man. In his Letters, Priestley reprints without comment an extract from A Short Account of the Honourable Emanuel Swedenborg (1787) in which Swedenborg says that “the Lord himself … was graciously pleased to manifest himself to me.”Priestley, Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church xvi-xvii. Elsewhere in the Letters, Priestley states the Unitarian belief that God is “invisible and omnipresent” and “not the object of any of our senses.”Priestley, Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church 63, 61.  Blake’s manner of articulating his idea of God obviously differs from  Priestley’s more temperate expression, yet Isaiah’s claim that God  cannot be seen “in a finite organical perception” but rather as “the  infinite in every thing” invites comparison with Priestley’s “invisible  and omnipresent” God. Ultimately, however, it is important to bear in  mind the essential difference between Blake and Priestley. It should be noted that Priestley’s overall purpose in his Letters is to emphasize what Unitarianism and Swedenborgianism have in commonSee Priestley, Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church 2: “We are even agreed with respect to many of the most important particulars of the corruptions of christian doctrine.” and to persuade Swedenborgians to become Unitarians. Blake criticizes Swedenborg as insufficiently visionary, while  Priestley finds fault with the irrational aspects of Swedenborg’s  writings and entreats Swedenborgians to “re-examine these things, and  believe no man in contradiction to your own reason.”Priestley, Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church 61. Priestley would also have been uncomfortable with the visionary dimensions of The Marriage.See Michael Scrivener, “A Swedenborgian Visionary and The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,” Blake 21.3 (winter 1987-88): 102: “The Marriage  runs counter in essential ways to the Rational Dissent of the Johnson  circle” and “positions itself against … Priestley,” particularly on  account of “Rational Dissent’s hostility to all varieties of ‘religious  enthusiasm.’” 
Butler is correct to point out that “Blake’s quarrel with the Swedenborgians is far less doctrinal than Priestley’s.”Butler 47.  Although Blake and Priestley do not agree exactly in their responses to  Swedenborg’s assertions, together they resist Swedenborg as a potential  “cause of imposition” (E 38, pl. 12) and source of further corruptions  of Christianity. It should come as no surprise that Blake may have had  Priestley’s writings in mind while he worked on The Marriage, given Priestley’s stature and intellectual prestige among the authors published by Joseph Johnson (for whom Blake produced eighty-three engravings during the period 1790-95).See Bentley 817-19.  I acknowledge patent differences in social standing between Priestley  (a prominent scientist, philosopher, biblical scholar, and theologian)  and Blake (an obscure engraver, printmaker, artist, and poet), but I  suggest that the two men are not so far apart in ideas as modern  scholarship would sometimes have us believe. That is not to say that  Priestley’s writings alone could have informed Blake’s response to  Swedenborg in The Marriage, but given their shared professional  associations in the Johnson circle, such similarities in their writings  seem more than merely coincidental.

William Blake’s Visionary Landscape near Felpham
 
By Jonathan Roberts
 
Jonathan Roberts (roberts@liv.ac.uk) is senior lecturer in the School of English, University of Liverpool.
 
 
 
Perhaps the most striking account of a  religious vision that Blake offers is a poem enclosed in an 1800 letter  to his friend and patron Thomas Butts. This rare moment of  autobiographical verse, usually referred to by its first line, “To my  Friend Butts,” describes Blake’s vision on the beach at Felpham. The  poem is well known beyond Blake studies, as it occurs more frequently in  anthologies of mysticism than any other passage from his work (with the  possible exception of the opening lines of “Auguries of Innocence”).  Yet within Blake studies it has received comparatively little scholarly  attention. This may be due in part to its anomalous character, something  that it shares with another work from the same period and place:  Blake’s pencil and watercolor sketch Landscape near Felpham. I  argue below that there is a significant and demonstrable relationship  between these two works, and that this connection offers a valuable  resource for reflection on our treatment of the relationship between the  material and the transcendent in our discussion of Blake.
 
My argument will be in three parts. Part I connects “To my Friend  Butts” to its biographical and biblical contexts and shows the ways in  which it is in dialogue with Butts’s own overlooked poem to Blake. Part  II provides a detailed analysis of Landscape near Felpham,  establishing Blake’s position and perspective when making the sketch,  demonstrating its visual accuracy, then dating it by relating its  minutiae (foliage, tide, weather, and so on) to historical records. I  thereby show that although they are not usually linked, the poem and the  sketch were probably made on the same morning, on the shore at Felpham  on one of the days leading up to Thursday, 2 October 1800. Part III  looks at the broader correspondence of the period, in which Blake draws  on Genesis 28 (Jacob’s ladder) to negotiate his new life situation, and I  use his watercolor of that story to reflect on the poem to Butts and  the Felpham sketch. I then connect the vision of God/Jesus at Felpham to  its surprising reappearance as a vision of Satan in Milton. I  conclude by reflecting on these different elements and by suggesting  that the popular and academic reception of Blake’s religion is at odds  with the hermeneutic of his Christological “fourfold vision.”  

I. “To my Friend Butts”
 
Blake’s three-yearFrom September 1800 to September 1803; his subsequent trial was held in Chichester on 11 January 1804 (see Bentley, Blake Records 179).  stay at Felpham has long been considered a turning point in his life,  through disillusionment, depression, the incident with Schofield the  soldier, and through what Jean H. Hagstrum called  a “genuine conversion” whereby “anger, energy, action” impelled him to  “become once again the dedicated artist-prophet.”Hagstrum 322.  Blake and his wife, Catherine, moved from their London home to Felpham  on Thursday, 18 September 1800. On 23 September Blake sent a letter to  Butts recounting the “chearfulness and welcome” of the journey, the  beautiful countryside, glorious weather, and, in some detail, the  excellence of their cottage. The villagers, air, wind, trees, and birds  are all mentioned, and in the days following their arrival Blake’s wife  and sister, conscious of the fashion for bathing at nearby Bognor,Blake to George Cumberland, 1 Sept. 1800 (Bentley, Blake Records  95-96). Alternatively, they may have been prompted by William Hayley:  Catherine had “Exhausted her strength” (Blake to Hayley, 16 Sept. 1800  [E 709]), and Hayley, on “any and every occasion, … would ‘plunge into  the ocean’, and he would, moreover, encourage others to plunge. What is  more, he would thus plunge at periods which, to our softer ideas, seem  positively inhumane. October bathing, for instance, was nothing to him”  (Bishop 96). Bognor would later become Bognor Regis when George V went  there to convalesce in 1929, as it was thought that the sea air would,  likewise, be good for his health (see, for example, http://​www.​bognorregis.​gov.​uk, under “History”). had already visited the seashore “courting Neptune for an Embrace.”Blake to Butts, 23 Sept. 1800 (E 711).  Butts replied within a week with a letter that Basil De Selincourt  rightly describes as “a cordial, jocular epistle,” adding, however, that  it is “in not too perfect taste,”De Selincourt 274.  presumably due to Butts’s preoccupation with imagining Mrs. Blake in  the heated embraces of Blake, of Neptune, and of Butts himself. Butts  writes: 

I am well pleased with your pleasures, feeling no small  interest in your Happiness, and it cannot fail to be highly gratifying  to me and my affectionate Partner to know that a Corner of your Mansion  of Peace is asylumed to Her, and when invalided and rendered unfit  for service who shall say she may not be quarter’d on your Cot—but for  the present she is for active Duty and satisfied with requesting that if  there is a Snug Berth unoccupied in any Chamber of your warm Heart,  that her Portrait may be suspended there, at the same time well aware  that you, like me, prefer the Original to the Copy. Your good Wife will  permit, and I hope may benefit from, the Embraces of Neptune, but she  will presently distinguish betwixt the warmth of his Embraces and  yours, and court the former with caution. I suppose you do not admit  of a third in that concern, or I would offer her mine even at this  distance. Allow me before I draw a Veil over this interesting Subject to  lament the frailty of the fairest Sex, for who alas! of us, my good  Friend, could have thought … So Virtuous a Woman would ever have fled from Hercules Buildings to Neptune’s Bed?Hercules  Buildings was the Blakes’ residence in London. Butts returns to the  image at the end of the letter: “Mrs Butts greets your Wife and  charming Sister with a holy Kiss and I, with old Neptune, bestow my  Embraces there also” (Butts to Blake, Sept. 1800 [Letters 25-27]).
 The couplet is the finale to Butts’s struggling attempt to stage-manage  the sustained innuendo concerning Mrs. Blake; he is more at ease with  the metaphors drawn from his job as chief clerk to the commissary  general of musters. 
Alongside this giggly flirtation, Butts includes a well-meant poem  blessing Blake and Catherine, wishing them long life and visions, and  imagining their ascent, after death, to heaven: 

Happy, happy, happy Pair, On Earth, in Sea, or eke in Air, In morn, at noon, and thro’ the Night From Visions fair receiving light, Long may ye live, your Guardians’ Care, And when ye die may not a Hair Fall to the lot of Demons black, Be singed by Fire, or heard to crack, But may your faithful Spirit upward bear Your gentle Souls to Him whose care Is ever sure and ever nigh Those who on Providence rely, And in his Paradise above Where all is Beauty, Truth and Love, O May ye be allowed to chuse For your firm Friend a Heaven-born Muse, From purest Fountains sip delight, Be cloathed in Glory burning bright, For ever blest, for ever free, The loveliest Blossoms on Life’s Tree.Letters 26-27.
 These are strange images to communicate to a friend, because by hoping  that Blake’s and Catherine’s bodies will not singe or crack in demonic  fires, Butts has imagined that very scenario. G.  E. Bentley, Jr., who has contributed so much to our knowledge of Butts,  depicts him as a “white collar Maecenas” who, in “the grey years when  reputation and even employment were hidden to Blake, … befriended and  supported perhaps the most independent and extraordinary genius that  ever offered wisdom for sale in the empty market place where none come  to buy.”Bentley, “Thomas Butts, White Collar Maecenas” 1066.  The homily is entirely justified, but, like Wordsworth’s epitaphic  paradigm of “truth hallowed by love—the joint offspring of the worth of  the dead and the affections of the living” (Essays upon Epitaphs),  it can occlude intriguing aspects of Butts’s character. In particular,  it is interesting to ponder what enabled Butts—unlike so many  contemporaries—to recognize the genius of Blake’s work. It may well be that in this one surviving letter from ButtsThe original is not extant; Butts, however, retained the draft and kept it with the letters he received from Blake (Letters  27n1). It is, as Bentley puts it, “an undated draft which begins in a  beautiful, clerkly copperplate hand and degenerates, through many  deletions … to hasty pencil at the end … later darkened in ink” (Blake Records 102fn).  we have an answer: he himself had a barely containable imagination that  even in a single correspondence is entertaining a ménage à trois with  his friends, their consummation in hellfire, and their ascent into  heaven. 
Blake’s reply of 2 October, like Butts’s original, mixes humor with  seriousness, reflecting the contractual relationship between the two  men, the literary aspirations of each (they both enclose poems), their  fondness for each other and each other’s wives, and the desire that they  have to impress one another. As Bentley puts it,  the “relationship revealed in these letters is one of close mutual  friendship and cordiality, with every sign of having been established  for some time.”Bentley, “Thomas Butts, White Collar Maecenas” 1055. The exchange is reciprocal: Butts, who would later buy a copy of Songs,  may well be nodding to “The Tyger” in his line “cloathed in Glory  burning bright,” while Blake’s gentle, jovial reply in turn picks up  images and ideas from Butts’s letter, with Blake describing himself as  “the determined advocate of Religion and Humility”—tongue in cheek, I  suspect—in response to what Bentley calls the “somewhat fulsome moral advice” offered by Butts.Bentley, “Thomas Butts, White Collar Maecenas” 1055.  After mentioning settling into the new cottage and apologizing for not  having completed Butts’s recent commissions, Blake offers his “return of  verses” that constitute the poem “To my Friend Butts.” The poem  describes Blake’s “first Vision of Light” while sitting on the sands at  Felpham. Gazing at the sea, he sees the particles of the sun’s light  revealed as human forms—“Heavenly Men”—who beckon to him and illuminate  the human reality of all natural phenomena (“Cloud Meteor and Star /  Are Men Seen Afar”). Approaching—or perhaps following—them, Blake finds  himself looking down upon the village from above, seeing “Felpham sweet /  Beneath my bright feet” (emphasis mine), sensing there the  “Shadows” of himself, his wife, sister, and friend, and reflecting that  we “like Infants descend / … on Earth.” The heavenly men eventually  coalesce as one divine man, who enfolds Blake to his bosom. The poem  ends, and without further comment, Blake’s letter returns to the matter  of commissions, the cottage, the weather, and so on, before concluding  with a second, much shorter verse, addressed to Mrs. Butts. The poem and  the containing letter are appended to this article, but the section of the poem that is most commonly anthologized is the opening: 



To my Friend Butts I write
 
My first Vision of Light
 
On the yellow sands sitting
 
The Sun was Emitting
 
His Glorious beams
 
From Heavens high Streams
 
Over Sea over Land
 
My Eyes did Expand
 
Into regions of air
 
Away from all Care
 
Into regions of fire
 
Remote from Desire
 
The Light of the Morning
 
Heavens Mountains adorning
 
In particles bright
 
The jewels of Light
 
Distinct shone and clear—
 
Amazd and in fear
 
I each particle gazed
 
Astonishd Amazed
 
For each was a Man
 
Human formd. Swift I ran
 
For they beckond to me
 
Remote by the Sea
 
Saying. Each grain of Sand
 
Every Stone on the Land
 
Each rock and each hill
 
Each fountain and rill
 
Each herb and each tree
 
Mountain hill Earth and Sea
 
Cloud Meteor and Star
 
Are Men Seen Afar


 The less frequently quoted ascent into the divine bosom that follows is described in this way: 


I stood in the Streams
 
Of Heavens bright beams
 
And Saw Felpham sweet
 
Beneath my bright feet
 
In soft Female charms
 
And in her fair arms
 
My Shadow I knew
 
And my wifes shadow too
 
And My Sister and Friend.
 
We like Infants descend
 
In our Shadows on Earth
 
Like a weak mortal birth
 
My Eyes more and more
 
Like a Sea without shore
 
Continue Expanding
 
The Heavens commanding
 
Till the Jewels of Light
 
Heavenly Men beaming bright
 
Appeard as One Man
 
Who Complacent began
 
My limbs to infold
 
In his beams of bright gold
 
Like dross purgd away
 
All my mire and my clay
 
Soft consumd in delight
 
In his bosom sun bright
 
I remaind. Soft he smild
 
And I heard his voice Mild
 
Saying This is My Fold
 
O thou Ram hornd with gold
 
Who awakest from sleep
 
On the sides of the Deep
 
On the Mountains around
 
The roarings resound
 
Of the lion and wolf
 
The loud sea and deep gulf
 
These are guards of My Fold
 
O thou Ram hornd with gold
 
And the voice faded mild
 
I remaind as a Child
 
All I ever had known
 
Before me bright Shone
 
I saw you and your wife
 
By the fountains of Life
 
Such the Vision to me
 
Appeard on the SeaBlake to Butts, 2 Oct. 1800 (E 712-13).


 
This unique lyric vision offers a poetic  report of a personal religious epiphany in a specific locale, which took  place, presumably, in the days immediately preceding the composition of  the letter.The poem picks up imagery from  Butts’s letter, which, although undated, must have been written between  24 September (after receipt of Blake’s, postmarked 23 September) and 30  September (to have been delivered in time for Blake to have composed a  reply by 2 October); see also Bentley, Blake Records 102fn.  The poem owes its first-person, loco-descriptive character, so unusual  in Blake, to its occurrence halfway through a letter to a friend. It has  other notable features too: it refers to the poet’s wife, sister, and  friend, and the catalyst to the vision is an experience of the natural  world. All these are characteristics that we might expect of, say, a  conversation poem, and in the wider romantic context, none of them is  unusual. We are quite used to this sort of setup in the work of other  poets of the period (Wordsworth’s “Lines Written a Few Miles above  Tintern Abbey” and Coleridge’s “The Eolian Harp” are obvious examples).  In Blake, however, it is a rarity. Elsewhere, we have many reports of  Blake’s visions; individuals such as Henry Crabb Robinson and Alexander  Gilchrist recount tales about the boy Blake’s being terrified by God  poking his head in at a window or delighted by finding angels up a tree.  But as a firsthand, to-the-moment account of being caught up into  heaven from Felpham and looking down at the village from above, this  poem is unique among Blake’s writings. Moreover, the first-person  narrative voice is different from that of the Blake to whom quotations  are often attributed, for this is neither the voice of the devil, nor a  song of innocence, nor the dramatized narrator of one of the prophecies.  It was not written for publication, but is more like the semi-private  effusion of Wordsworth’s “Distressful gift! this Book receives.” Its  intimate character gives it a special place in his oeuvre, and,  consistent with the letter in which it is found, its privacy and  inwardness show us things less often seen in Blake.
 
Our understanding of “To my Friend Butts” may be enhanced by  considering its companion piece, the rarely discussed poem for Mrs.  Butts that Blake encloses in the same letter. “Mrs Butts,” he writes, “will Excuse the following lines”: 

Wife of the Friend of those I most revere. Recieve this tribute from a Harp sincere Go on in Virtuous Seed sowing on Mold Of Human Vegetation and Behold Your Harvest Springing to Eternal life Parent of Youthful Minds and happy Wife
 One way to read this overlooked poem is as a disarming of Butts’s bit of  innuendo. Declining to sustain the banter about embracing Neptune,  Blake instead writes a rather chaste verse about Mrs. Butts, reasserting  her proper place as the wife of his revered friend. With that  established, he is able to praise her pedagogical,“Betsy  [Butts] had a boarding school for girls at 9 Great Marlborough Street  at which Blake may have taught and which was decorated with his  drawings” (Bentley, Blake Records 90). maternal, and matriarchal fruitfulness—all this in the language of fertility—without turning his verse to her body or sexuality.A  final note on the tenor of the poem. Blake, perhaps unsurprisingly  given his new setting—by the sea and cornfields—uses images of water and  of harvest. The mention of “Springing to Eternal life” echoes John 4.14  (“whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never  thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of  water springing up into everlasting life”). Likewise, the invocation to  “Go on in Virtuous Seed sowing … / … and Behold / Your Harvest  Springing to Eternal life” evokes numerous New Testament passages, not  least the parable of the sower in Matthew 13.2-9, a passage that—with a  wonderful appropriateness given the context—is immediately preceded by  the line “The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea  side.” All quotations from the Bible are from the Authorized (King James) Version.  This response may provide a helpful cue for thinking about how “To my  Friend Butts” is responding to Butts’s “Happy … Pair.” Butts’s poem is  surprisingly carnal in its imagined burning of his friends’ flesh, and  just as Blake’s verse to Mrs. Butts seeks to limit the sexual life of  his friend’s letter, so “To my Friend Butts” may likewise be  neutralizing the apocalyptic elements of Butts’s vision by bringing that  vision out of the future into the present and out of heaven and hell  back to Felpham. There may be both an element of good-humored visionary  one-upmanship here and a practical demonstration by Blake of what vision  is. There is also, though it goes against the  grain of a widely cherished image of Blake, a unique instance of the  great champion of unfettered imagination and supposed advocate of free  love attempting to tone down and rein in the fantasies of his patron and  friend.Even Val, the renegade of Marilyn French’s The Women’s Room,  who “saw the whole world in terms of” sex, “used to say that only Blake  had known what the world was really about” and “read Blake at night:  the book lay always on her bedside table” (chapter 16). The situation is only  complicated by (i) Blake’s later (1809) picture of the whore of Babylon,  which bears a striking resemblance to Mrs. Butts, although Bentley  decides this “must be coincidental” (caption to pl. 75, The Stranger from Paradise),  and (ii) the romantic overtones of Blake’s “The Phoenix to Mrs Butts.”  Joseph Viscomi notes that perhaps “it is not a coincidence that the  couplets of Blake’s other verses have three or five beats to the line,  whereas those of ‘The Phoenix’ have four, the same number of accents as  in the couplets of Thomas Butts’s poem to Blake.” Moreover, he says that  “Mr. Butts also wrote Blake a poem, included in a September 1800  letter, explicitly acknowledging his affection for Catherine Blake and  Blake’s affection for Mrs. Butts—acknowledgments not without double  entendres” (Viscomi 15). The affection that Viscomi mentions is  expressed in the letter rather than the poem. What is  certain is that the two poems are in dialogue, and that our  understanding of “To my Friend Butts” can be deepened through  consideration of its response to the narrative and imagery of Butts’s  “Happy … Pair.” 
This dialogue is especially evident in the shared religious (and  specifically biblical) imagery that the two men deploy, which both  provides common ground and marks out their differences. Butts’s  poem uses the second person in an imagined future and draws on the book  of Revelation to narrate his hope that after their deaths the Blakes  will ascend to heavenHe uses “Paradise  above” rather than “heaven,” but the synonymity is clear from the other  details and has biblical precedents in, for example, the crucifixion  narrative of Luke 23.42-43: “And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me  when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say  unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.” and be  united with God. The narrative structure—judgment and burning, ascent  and glory—also echoes the final chapters of the New Testament, in which  the casting of the devil into the lake of fire and brimstone in chapter  20 is followed by the description of the new heaven and earth in  chapters 21 and 22. The picture of heaven that  Butts unfolds, in which the Blakes will from “purest Fountains sip  delight” and become the “loveliest Blossoms on Life’s Tree,” appears to  be drawn from the crystal-clear river and tree of life of Revelation  22.1-2.“And he shewed me a pure river of  water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and  of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of  the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of  fruits ….” Likewise, Butts’s hope that the Blakes will be  “cloathed in Glory” may relate to the martyrs in Revelation 6.9-11, who  are given “white robes,” which also feature in Revelation 7.9-17. He may also be drawing on 1 Corinthians 15 at this point,“For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality” (1 Corinthians 15.53).  a discussion in which Paul, like Butts, is emphatically concerned with  death and resurrection, kinds of glory, and being clothed anew. Blake,  by contrast, works with a different paradigm of the transformation being  wrought on the individual, as he presents not new clothing in his poem,  but a bodily union with the “One Man” who enfolds his limbs. Blake, like Butts, has biblical precedents here,For  example, Philippians 3.20-21, in which Jesus “shall change our vile  body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body.” but  his account has a freshness and intimacy with the divine, in comparison  with which Butts’s offer of a future encounter with a God “known by his Attributes”“Him  whose care / Is ever sure and ever nigh / Those who on Providence  rely”; the quotation in the text is from Blake’s critique of Newton’s  vision of God in The Everlasting Gospel (E 519). seems  like an ideal in a picture book. This shift epitomizes the way in which  Blake’s poem fulfills or reimagines the hopes of Butts’s verse: Butts  wishes Blake “Visions fair receiving light,” and Blake responds with his  own “first Vision of Light”; Butts hopes that after death Blake’s soul  will be borne up to heaven, and Blake responds with a full-blown account  of how this has already happened, being taken up into God’s bosom as a  present reality, not as an imagined afterlife. Butts concludes by  wishing that the Blakes will from “purest Fountains sip delight”; Blake  closes by recounting how he “saw you [Butts] and your wife / By the  fountains of Life.” In sum, Blake reclaims Butts’s narrative by  retelling it in the present, in the first person, and by offering an  immediate, earthly realization of the eschatological promises of Butts’s  poem. This is a marked contrast from Butts’s  vision because, for Blake, our place in heaven does not have to come at  the expense of our place in the world.I will return to this continuity of the eternal and the everyday when discussing the relationship of the poem to the sketch.
 
Acknowledgment of this biblical dialogue is important because it has largely been lost in the reception history of the poem.The  poem occasionally appears in scholarly publications, but is usually  discussed in passing, often in the demonstration of some larger theory  of Blake’s work (see, for example, Frye 42). Kathleen Raine picks it up  in a footnote in Blake and Tradition, linking Blake’s imagery of the “One Man” (line 51) to the work of Swedenborg, speculating that Blake may have read Newton’s Opticks  during his residence at Felpham, and noting that the particles of light  (line 19) have Newtonian resonances (Raine 1: 420-22). In one of the  few sustained discussions of the poem, Donald Ault’s Visionary Physics relates these resonances to Blake’s theory of fourfold vision, a theme also discussed by David Wells in A Study of William Blake’s Letters. De Selincourt provides some helpful observations on the poem in William Blake,  and Stephen D. Cox, who looks at the visionary logic of the poem,  suggests it is “the clearest, least mediated, literary record we have of  a Blakean vision” (Cox 31). In Symbol and Truth in Blake’s Myth,  Leopold Damrosch, Jr., provides perhaps the fullest reading of the poem  as the testimony of a biographical event and attempts to analyze the  kind of experience that Blake is recounting. My earlier discussion of  the biblical imagery of “To my Friend Butts” is in Blake. Wordsworth. Religion. 75-80. “To my Friend Butts” has remained a staple of popular anthologies of mystical verse over the last century, from The Oxford Book of English Mystical Verse (1917) to Poetry for the Spirit (2002), and, as the title of the latter suggests, has been widely admired in what might be called new-age publications.See, for example, the 1963 article in the Theosophist journal,  which quotes the poem and then comments, “To know ourselves fully as  the One Heavenly Man is the goal of our return journey. On the outward  journey, the Monad through the Ego discovers the circumference, the  not-Self, the many. On the return journey he rediscovers that the many  are the One” (Galloway 92). This has been facilitated by the abridgment of the second half of the poem, an abridgment that foregrounds the generic mystical featuresI mean the sorts of characteristics categorized by William James (see James 329). while obscuring the biblical dialogue that is taking place. Recovering this dialogue enriches and clarifies the meanings of the poem,As Robert N. Essick and Viscomi write about Milton, “much of the code of Milton remains obscure unless we attend to the Bible” (Essick and Viscomi 13). as two instances will demonstrate. First, Blake’s ascent above Felpham. Appearing  initially in the third-person stories of Enoch (Genesis 5.24) and  Elijah (2 Kings 2.11), accounts of being taken in vision up into heaven  are given in the first person by Ezekiel, Paul the Apostle, and John of  Patmos.For a fuller discussion of Blake’s  interest in Enoch and the ascent of Enoch through the palaces of heaven  in 1 Enoch, see Rowland. Ezekiel, for example, is lifted up by the spirit and taken into vision,“And  he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head;  and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and  brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem” (Ezekiel 8.3). and Paul and John record comparable experiences in 2 Corinthians“I  will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. I knew a man in  Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or  whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one  caught up to the third heaven. And I knew … how that he was caught up  into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a  man to utter” (2 Corinthians 12.1-4). and in Revelation.“After  this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first  voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which  said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be  hereafter. And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne  was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne” (Revelation 4.1-2).  Blake’s poem participates in this tradition, sharing the elements of  being taken up into heaven or paradise and hearing God speak, then  returning to earth to report the news.
 
Second, the union with (and identity of) the “One Man.” Geoffrey Keynes is only partially right in his assumption that this is “Los, the Spirit of Prophecy.”See Letters 29n1. Keynes derives this from Sloss and Wallis. I will discuss the connection to Los more closely (with reference to Milton) in the final section.  The “One Man” often appears in Blake’s work, whether as the “Universal  Family” (E 180, 311), “Universal Humanity” (E 377), or as Jesus (E 116,  143). In “To my Friend Butts” the extensive biblical allusions make the  identification clear, for although God and Jesus are not explicitly  named, there are numerous associations. The “One Man,” like God and  Jesus, is figured as a shepherdSee, for example, Psalms 23.1 and John 10.11. (he refers twice to the earth as his “Fold,” and addresses Blake as his “Ram”).The language of mountain, sea, wolf, and sheep in the poem is also found in Isaiah 11, which anticipates the Messiah.  Blake’s encounter with him is, moreover, personal and intimate: Blake  rests in his “bosom” just as Lazarus rests in the bosom of Abraham (Luke  16.22) and as the beloved disciple rests in the bosom of Jesus at the  Last Supper (John 13.23). The passage itself has a baptismal character,  as Blake’s “mire” and “clay” are “Like dross purgd away,” and the  central vision of light reflects visionary encounters with God and Jesus  found throughout the Bible. The visions of Ezekiel, Paul, and John mentioned above are likewise all associated with light;The  spirit that lifts Ezekiel is “a likeness as the appearance of fire:  from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins  even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber”  (Ezekiel 8.2). During Paul’s conversion near Damascus “suddenly there  shined round about him a light from heaven” (Acts 9.3), and Jesus  Christ, who appears to John, is described in these words: “His head and  his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a  flame of fire” (Revelation 1.14). Moses’s encounter with God  leaves his face shining (Exodus 34.29ff.), an image recapitulated in the  transfiguration of Jesus, whose “face did shine as the sun” and whose  “raiment was white as the light” (Matthew 17.2), and by Blake in the  preface to Milton, which asks (about Jesus) “did the Countenance Divine, / Shine forth upon our clouded hills?” (E 95). The association of Jesus with light is also central to the Gospel of John.“In  the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was  God. … In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the  light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. … That  was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world”  (John 1.1-9).
 
In sum, “To my Friend Butts” is suffused with biblical imagery, and  that imagery is not limited to the poetic moment but is part of a wider  discussion that carries through into Blake’s correspondence of this  period. In part III I will be extending this discussion to look at the  central organizational metaphor of this poem and of Blake’s wider  correspondence, before relating it to Blake’s contemporary sketch Landscape near Felpham, to which I now turn.  

II. Landscape near Felpham
 
 
1. William Blake, Landscape near Felpham, c. 1800. See enlargement. © Tate, London 2013.

 
Landscape near Felpham (illus. 1) is a sketch in pencil with  a watercolor wash. It depicts the view toward Felpham from the south,  looking across cornfields to (from left to right) White Mill and an outbuilding,This  was perhaps the largest smock mill ever built in Sussex (a smock mill  is typically wooden, tapered, and hexagonal or octagonal in plan). See  Blythman 45. Including the cap and two-storey base, it appears to have  been seven storeys tall. the tower and church of St. Mary the Virgin, Hayley’s new villa, the Turret (later known as Turret House), and, to the right, the Blakes’ cottage.The identification is made in Butlin 1: 313 (#368).  The sketch is faint, but the mill, trees, tower, church, and cottage  are all quite clear. Some details are less obvious. The rough  brushstrokes in the foreground represent the sea, and there is the most  elementary boat to the right, with a large oblong shape over it that is  difficult to make out: it might represent a cow grazing, or possibly a  shrub (at the bottom right of this unpainted rectangle is a pencil  detail that could depict either an animal’s legs or the stems of a  plant). In the left foreground there is vegetation on the shoreline. A  fence runs across the field, and a little right of center is a rider on a  horse (riding right to left). Between the rider and the mill two  figures, perhaps, stand against the fence. On the right of the field,  and slightly more distant, might be another figure or animal. There are  clouds and sunshine, with rays of light falling on the cottage. The  pencil elements of the sketch are naturalistic and attentive to detail:  the original winding device of the mill and the abat-son (although not  the crenellation) of the church tower, for example, are both visible.
 
The Felpham sketch is, in some respects, Blake’s most ordinary picture, prompting Raymond Lister to write that the scene “amply  demonstrates what the main body of his work has led some to doubt, that  he was capable of painting straightforward landscapes.”Lister pl. 25. Blake, as far as we know, rarely sketched his surroundings. The  examples that we do have are principally of Hayley’s previous house, at  Eartham, and appear to have been made for the latter’s records.In  Butlin there are a number of sketches from c. 1801 that were probably  made on the same day as one another when Blake visited Eartham (see 1:  313-14, #369-73). Yet the oddness of this “straightforward”  romantic landscape sketch only really becomes apparent against the wider  backdrop of Blake’s visual art. In the 1990s, the Blake room at the  Tate was dominated by the great color prints that include Elohim Creating Adam, The Good and Evil Angels, Newton, and Nebuchadnezzar, and the temperas of The Spiritual Form of Nelson Guiding Leviathan and The Ghost of a Flea. Then—in a sudden departure from this apocalyptic cosmos—there was Landscape near Felpham.  It is a work that seems to step out of Blake’s mythological world and  into his everyday life, and like the letter and poem to Butts, it is a  private work that discloses a rarely seen side of his character and art.  Certainly by the end of the decade, Blake would not have hung the  Felpham sketch in an exhibition. The very different kind of public artist that he later wished to be is clear from the 1809 catalogue of his “Exhibition of Paintings in Fresco, Poetical and Historical Inventions.”For  example, “if Art is the glory of a Nation, if Genius and Inspiration  are the great Origin and Bond of Society, the distinction my Works have  obtained from those who best understand such things, calls for my  Exhibition as the greatest of Duties to my Country” (E 528). See also  David Blayney Brown and Martin Myrone’s discussion in “William Blake’s  1809 Exhibition.”
 
The central similarity between “To my Friend Butts” and Landscape near Felpham  is an obvious one: both describe an experience on the beach at Felpham.  Moreover, the relationship of the sketch to Blake’s wider visual oeuvre  is similar to the relationship of the poem to his wider literary  oeuvre: both offer an atypical first-person account of a local scene,  and both forego the characteristic polemical and dramatic elements of  Blake’s art. Put in these terms, one might expect the two to have been linked critically, yet they have not.Although  the poem and sketch have long been recognized as works from  approximately the same place and time, their apparent experiential  disparity seems to have discouraged critical investigation of their  actual connection. So, for example, when discussing the sketch, Lister  (pl. 25) does quote part of the poem, but does not suggest that the two  may represent the same moment. Butlin writes that it is “tempting to see  this watercolour as Blake’s first reaction to the prospect that opened  up with his move to Felpham,” and quotes the letter to Flaxman  concerning “Celestial inhabitants” (see paragraph 24, below), but takes this intuition no further (1: 313). I discuss the connection between the sketch and poem in Blake. Wordsworth. Religion. 7-15 and 34-36. So what historical evidence is there that the sketch and poem are two sides of the same coin?
 
Given the first-person character of these pieces, it is worth  beginning with Blake’s location: where was he when he made the sketch,  and when did he make it? Frederick Tatham, who vouchsafed the picture,  added “subject not known. perhaps near Felpham”; in fact, there is no  question of the location, as this is certainly Felpham itself, the  village seen from a viewpoint that can be located to within a few  meters. The scene can no longer be viewed, not only because the mill and  turret no longer exist, but because of the extensive twentieth-century  housing that now fills the landscape. Nonetheless, the four fixed points  in the sketch—the mill, the church, the turret, and the cottage—are visible on the first edition of the Ordnance Survey County Series map,Ordnance  Survey County Series 1:2500, 1st ed. (1854–1901), “Sussex County.” The  layout of Turret House can be established from surviving architectural  plans and pictures; see Crosby, “The Sketch on the Verso of Blake’s  Self-Portrait: An Identification.” and their coordinates can be cross-referenced with modern satellite imagery such as that provided by Google Earth. The exact positions of the buildings can thereby be established,Mill: 50.785652, -0.654725; church: 50.790731, -0.654655; turret: 50.790617, -0.652571; cottage: 50.788670, -0.652510. These coordinates can be pasted directly into the search bar of Google Earth. as can the distances between them,Mill–church: 560.7 m; mill–turret: 572.8 m; mill–cottage: 362.7 m; church–turret: 149 m; church–cottage: 272.5 m. and this information can be related to their relative positions within the sketch itself. Blake’s position when drawing the sketch can then be estimated using triangulation.We  imagine Blake standing facing the scene he is painting, with his  sketchbook in front of him. Visual angles between landmarks in the scene  will be represented as distances between them on his canvas. Although  we can’t know the scale of this representation, given three landmarks we  can look for locations where the relative angles between adjacent pairs  of landmarks are in the same proportions as those Blake has depicted.  This leads to an equation whose solution is a one-dimensional curve on  the map. In the painting there are four prominent landmarks, so that we  have two such curves, and we conclude that Blake was standing where  these curves intersect. There is only one such point from which the  landmarks would also be in the same order, left to right, as in Blake’s  painting.
 
So where was Blake standing (or sitting)? The main evidence comes  from the sketch itself: in the foreground are waves and a boat,  suggesting that Blake himself must have been in a boat, a little out to  sea, when he drew the scene. Further out from the shore Felpham beach  slopes very gradually; close to the shoreline it shelves steeply, as can  be seen in illus. 2, yet Blake has a high eyeline  on the scene before him. There are numerous groynes on the beach, but  (again, as illus. 2 shows) these would still not provide sufficient  elevation for the given eyeline. This suggests that the sketch must have  been made at full tide—anything less would have provided insufficient  elevation—and indeed the tide appears full in the image. Blake’s approximate position, triangulated from the sketch,50.785471, -0.654257.  is a little out to sea, although this evidence is only suggestive, as  early nineteenth-century maps of the scene lack detail of the shoreline,  and the shore has eroded substantially since 1800, eventually taking the mill with it.Blythman 44. The erosion is quite evident when the Ordnance Survey map is overlaid on a modern satellite image of Felpham.  Although the mill was dismantled in 1879, there are a number of  surviving images of the building from the nineteenth century. The  erosion of the shore can be seen in illus. 2 (Percy Thomas’s 1878  etching), and the sheer size of the mill can be seen by looking at the  human figures in illus. 3.

 What these images offer is a perhaps unique opportunity to establish the  facility and accuracy with which Blake was able to draw  three-dimensional architectural objects from life. Of particular  interest is a mid-nineteenth-century photograph of White Mill alongside  Blake’s sketch (from a different angle) of the same (illus. 3).

 Illus. 3 provides an interesting contrast to illus. 4, in which Blake’s depiction of his cottage in Milton (pl. 36) is juxtaposed with an early twentieth-century photograph.The similarities between the cottage in Landscape near Felpham and the Milton image have been noted by Butlin (1: 313); see also the 1979 photograph of Allen Ginsberg wielding the Milton image in front of the cottage http://​www.​allenginsberg.​org/​index.php?page=blake-s-cottage-at-felpham.  A painstakingly detailed account of the original structure of the  cottage can be found in Crosby, “‘The sweetest spot on earth’:  Reconstructing Blake’s Cottage at Felpham, Sussex.”

 The Milton cottage is presumably drawn from memory at a later date, and is naive compared to the simple, confident, and accurate lines of the mill.Landscape near Felpham and Milton are in different media; nonetheless, the proportions of the mill appear to be much more accurate than those of the cottage.  This difference is also evident in the detail of the waves and the boat  in the Felpham sketch. The picture is unfinished, but the waves bear  little resemblance to the surface of any sea, and the boat, which looks  unlike any contemporary (or seaworthy) vessel, is, however, similar to  the moon boats in Jerusalem (see illus. 5).

 This difference in style and medium suggests that the boat and watercolor wash are later additions to the sketch.They  seem to me to be visual annotations rather than part of a two-stage  composition process in which the image is developed. They are roughly  done, and in a medium that will not allow them to be overpainted. Part of  the singular character of the sketch is that Blake is relaxed enough to  drop his principled opposition to copying from nature, which he  elsewhere treats as “the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me,” claiming that  “Natural Objects always did and now do Weaken deaden and obliterate  Imagination.”A Vision of the Last Judgment (E 565); annotations to Wordsworth’s Poems (E 665). See also the discussion in Milton  of “the murderers / Of Jesus, who deny the Faith and mock at Eternal  Life: / Who pretend to Poetry that they may destroy Imagination; / By  imitation of Natures Images drawn from Remembrance” (E 142). 
In summary, Landscape near Felpham provides a number of  distinct, though related, kinds of accuracy that can be cross-checked  with nineteenth-century maps and photographs. It demonstrates (as  perhaps no other work by Blake does) that he could and did sketch  landscapes accurately from life, and that he could do so with an  impressive precision in terms of spatial relationships, perspective,  proportion, and visual detail. This mimetic accuracy offers, moreover,  an unusual opportunity in Blake criticism to attempt to date the  composition by careful consideration of the other details (tidal,  meteorological, botanical) of the picture. Working with the hypothesis  that this is a record of a real scene (i.e., as seen by Blake on a  particular day at a particular time), we can relate the conditions that  are evident in the sketch (i) to one another, (ii) to details in Blake’s  correspondence, and (iii) to other sources, such as contemporary  newspapers. The date that we derive from this specific combination of  temporal details can then be related to the composition date of “To my  Friend Butts.”
 
Let us begin with the year of composition. There are only four  possibilities: 1800, 1801, 1802, 1803, as Blake was not in Felpham  either before or after these dates. Unlike the letter, the sketch is undated, but has been designated as 1800,Butlin dates the sketch c. 1800 (1: 312).  and the logic here seems just: the picture is full of optimism with its  open skies and fields and the sunbeams falling on the cottage. The  cheerful mood and the uncharacteristic interest in the subject matter  are concomitant with the effusive delight over his cottage and setting  that Blake expresses in his letters in the weeks before and after his  arrival in Felpham. That delight is not present in later correspondence,The  one later exception is “Felpham Cottage / of Cottages the prettiest,”  11 Sept. 1801 (E 717). Hayley says, “Our good Blake grows more and  more attach’d to this pleasant marine village” (to Flaxman, 18 Oct. 1801  [Letters 37]), but this is part of a pair of open letters that includes content from Blake, who doesn’t pick up on the comment.  and this is not simply due to the shine wearing off his surroundings.  Blake became unhappy quite quickly, and Catherine was ill for a long  period, almost from arrival. Whereas the 1800 letters are full of  optimism and delight, the letters of 1801 and 1802 are, as David Bindman  puts it, “full of impassioned distress.”Bindman 135. By  22 November 1802 Blake explains to Butts that he has “been very Unhappy  and could not think of troubling you about it or any of my real  Friends (I have written many letters to you which I burnd and did not  send).”E 719. That  dark mood carries from the letters into the poetry of the later period,  and is manifest in another rare loco-descriptive poem of this time,  which offers a fascinating point of comparison to “To my Friend Butts.”In  his second letter to Butts of 22 November 1802, Blake specifically  states that he has written a poem while walking: “I will bore you more  with some Verses which My Wife desires me to Copy out and send you  with her kind love and Respect they were Composed above a  twelvemonth ago [in a] while Walking from Felpham to Lavant to meet my Sister” (E 720). It is a poem that starts in a mood similar to that of 2 October 1800: 

With happiness stretchd across the hills In a cloud that dewy sweetness distills With a blue sky spread over with wings And a mild sun that mounts and sings
 But like a dark counterpart to Felpham’s “Heavenly Men,” it is the dead  who show up, as the pleasant scene of nature rapidly degenerates into  visionary horrors: 
With my Father hovering upon the wind And my Brother Robert just behind And my Brother John the evil one In a black cloud making his mone Tho dead they appear upon my path Notwithstanding my terrible wrath They beg they intreat they drop their tears Filld full of hopes filld full of fears
 
The visceral force of this later writing is unmistakable, and for  these reasons the year of composition of the sketch seems certain to be  1800. But what about the month? We are fortunate in this respect that  the sketch shows both trees and crops, and this is consistent with the  letters of this period, in which Blake is uncharacteristically detailed  about his surroundings. He writes to Cumberland: 

I have taken a Cottage at Felpham on the Sea Shore of Sussex between Arundel and Chichester. Mr  Hayley the Poet is soon to be my neighbour[;] he is now my friend; to  him I owe the happy suggestion, for it was on a visit to him that I fell  in love with my Cottage. … We lie on a Pleasant shore[;] it is within a  mile of Bognor to which our Fashionables resort[.] My Cottage faces the  South about a Quarter of a Mile from the Sea, only corn fields between.Blake to Cumberland, 1 Sept. 1800 (Bentley, Blake Records 95-96).
 These are the same fields portrayed in the sketch, but there they do not depict acres of waving corn;Blake could draw corn; see, for example, The Blighted Corn in Lister pl. 63(i).  rather, they appear to be bare. A rider on a horse trots across the  field, and there are no stalks, leaves, or ears of corn visible either  generally or around, for example, the base of the fences. This indicates that the sketch was not made during Blake’s initial visit to Felpham in July 1800,He  was in Felpham for most of July 1800: “On 5 July 1800, Flaxman sent  with Blake a letter and gifts to Hayley, and on 16 July Hayley wrote to  Flaxman that ‘our good enthusiastic Friend Blake will … extend the time  of his Residence in the south a little longer than we at first  proposed’” (Bentley, Stranger from Paradise 208fn). a time at which the corn would have been fully grown. The early harvest was brought in during August,“Agriculture—Monthly  report for August. From the uncommon fineness of the weather during the  whole of the last month, and the greatest part of the present, the  harvest in most places commenced a fortnight or three weeks sooner than  usual, and in many of the southern and western districts, on this  account, much of the crops have been already secured” (Hampshire Chronicle 8 Sept. 1800).  after Blake had gone back to London; therefore the sketch must have  been made after he returned to Felpham in mid-September, by which time  the fields were being prepared for the following year. Indeed, one of  the first events recorded by Blake after his return is seeing the  ploughman: “A roller and two harrows lie before  my window. I met a plow on my first going out at my gate the first  morning after my arrival and the Plowboy said to the Plowman. ‘Father  The Gate is Open.’”Blake to Butts, 23 Sept. 1800 (E 711). 
This gives us 19 September 1800—the Blakes’ first full day in  Felpham—as the earliest date for the sketch, but what is the latest  possible date? Here the foliage provides an answer. The trees that are  visible in the sketch (and which can be identified on the Ordnance  Survey map) are a line of boundary trees. From the sketch, they appear  to be deciduous hardwoods, quite possibly the same types of large  spreading trees that still grow in the same location today: beech, oak,  and horse chestnut. Although these trees would  still have been in full leaf in September, the seasonal defoliation  would have been quite advanced by the end of October, and given that  there are no visible branches or other signs of defoliation in the  sketch, it seems reasonable to take the end of October as the latest  possible date for the picture’s composition.As  the weather had been unseasonably mild, the trees might have held their  leaves a little longer. Even so, there are no branches visible on any  of the trees in the picture. Certainly all leaves (and many branches)  would have been gone by Sunday, 9 November, when a hurricane blew down  houses, a mill, a barn, and uprooted 200 “stately oaks” at Glynde Bourne  (Hampshire Chronicle 17 Nov. 1800). This establishes a  six-week window within which the sketch might have been made, between  Friday, 19 September 1800 and Friday, 31 October 1800 (by which time  arboreal defoliation would have been clearly visible). Narrowing the  timeframe further requires working with a combination of tidal and solar  information. The visibility of crepuscular rays  in the sketch makes it possible to estimate the position of the sun, as  the point of convergence of the rays can be located toward the top right  of the picture.“In real skies the  crepuscular rays (the bright and dark beams apparently radiating from  the sun when blocked by clouds) help one considerably to guess where the  sun is, because they cross one another at the solar position. This  phenomenon makes it very easy to locate the sun” (Barta et al. 1032).  The sketch is made facing north, and the sun is shown to be in the  east/southeast in the image, so this is certainly morning, and the  elevation of the sun would suggest mid-morning. For the purposes of this  discussion I am therefore giving the broad parameters of a time of  composition at least an hour after dawn and at least an hour before  noon. This timeframe can then be related to the tidal conditions in  order to narrow further the date. As I demonstrated earlier, for the  sketch to have been made the tide must have been full, and indeed we see  it lapping against the field’s edge. The dates  on which high water occurred between one hour after dawn and eleven in  the morning during the period from 19 September to 31 October are as  follows: (i) Tuesday, 30 September to Thursday, 2 October inclusive;  (ii) Wednesday, 15 October to Saturday, 18 October inclusive; and (iii)  Wednesday, 29 October.Tide timetables  (which include times of sunrise and sunset) are available for Bognor for  this period, along with tide heights. See http://​easytide.​ukho.​gov.​uk.  The last date is the least likely due to the probability of visible  defoliation (of which the sketch shows no evidence). We are left with  only two 3-4 day periods during Blake’s three-year stay in Felpham when  the sketch could have been made. The first (30 September to 2 October)  exactly coincides with the composition of the poem and letter to Butts. The  probability of this particular timeframe (rather than the later date)  corresponding to the composition of the sketch is further increased, as  the details of weather (sunshine and clouds) described in both the  letter and the poem it contains coincide with what we see in the  picture.Blake writes, “Our Cottage looks  more and more beautiful. And tho the weather is wet, the Air is very  Mild. much Milder than it was in London when we came away” (to Butts, 2  Oct. 1800 [E 713-14]). On top of this, of course, we know that  Blake had been at the location of the sketch at this time because his  presence there is the subject of the poem.
 
What can we conclude from this? It is highly probable that the sketch  of Felpham and the poem to Butts were composed within the same  three-day period, and it is probable (given consistency of internal  details regarding weather and time of day) that the scene they describe  refers to the same day. Might they be the visual and literary  manifestations of the same biographical experience? At first it seems  not, as the sketch indicates that Blake was on a boat, whereas the poem  has him on “the yellow sands sitting.” It is difficult to be certain how  the shoreline looked in 1800, but today, at least, the “yellow sands”  are not visible when the tide is full, as the upper shore is shale. It  is possible, of course, that Blake was “on the yellow shale sitting” or  “on the yellow shingle sitting” but that he preferred to use “sand,”There  is a poetic latitude in the description of the clouds as “Heavens  Mountains,” for example. We have no record of Blake’s using the terms  “shale” or “shingle” elsewhere. which is such a significant term elsewhere in his work.He  uses the word in poems that bear a significant thematic relationship to  the subject under discussion; see, for example, the “World in a Grain  of Sand” of “Auguries of Innocence” (E 490), and the sands of the  seashore (and particles of light) that reflect the “beams divine” and  that blow into atheist eyes in “Mock on Mock on Voltaire Rousseau” (E  477). Such an argument need only be made, however, if it is  assumed that the epiphany took place in a moment. Yet this is not what  the poem narrates. Blake recounts an experience that takes place over  time, and that starts out as a vision by the sea, but ends with a vision on  it: “Such the Vision to me / Appeard on the Sea” concludes the poem.  Perhaps, then, Blake’s vision began on the shore and ended on a boat.  But wouldn’t he have mentioned putting out in a boat? Not necessarily,  as he makes no explicit acknowledgment of his position in the sketch of  the same scene. Perhaps so, but does “on the Sea” mean that Blake was on  the sea, or just the vision? Granted, this is  ambiguous, though the prepositional structure echoes the opening of the  poem, which locates Blake and his “Vision of Light / On the yellow  sands.”The poem is more difficult to  locate in space and time. The extempore character of the sketch and its  visual accuracy indicate that there was no chronological space between  the events depicted and the recording of those events, but this is not  necessarily the case with the poem. Blake might have written the poem  sitting on the beach or on the boat. But he might equally have composed  it as part of his letter to Butts back at the cottage later the same  day, or a day or two later, though the phrasing of the letter suggests  that the poem was already written, as Blake “cannot resist the  temptation” of sending it to Butts. No firm conclusions can be  drawn here; rather, the subject opens out the great difficulty of  discussing recorded “religious” experience: such visions may be  autobiographical, but they are also inextricably textual. It is these  textual parameters and the continuity of metaphor and image with Blake’s  correspondence in this period that I now wish to consider in more  detail. 

III. Stairway to Heaven
 
Essick and Viscomi write in their introduction to Milton  that “Blake was so fully imbued with the language of the Bible that it  is frequently difficult to separate purposeful allusion from the  unselfconscious repetition of habitual patterns in many of Blake’s  poems.”Essick and Viscomi 13.  Indeed, throughout his art and correspondence, the Bible is not so much a  subject of discussion as a means to understanding. It is not a static,  self-interpreting monolith (the very thing his art contests), but a  heuristic resource to understand his own life situation. This is  especially evident in the correspondence surrounding the move to  Felpham, which shows that the central tropes that Blake employs in “To  my Friend Butts”—the ascent to heaven and return to earth, and the  interaction of heavenly and earthly beings—neither begin nor end with  the correspondence to his patron, but are a more widespread element of  his thought at this time, and may be found in the letters that date back  to his preliminary journey to Felpham in July.
 
In July, Blake had written to Cumberland “I begin to Emerge from a Deep pit of Melancholy,”Blake to Cumberland, 2 July 1800 (E 706). and by the time he had reached Felpham in September, he could write “And Now Begins a New life. because another covering of Earth is shaken off.”Blake to Flaxman, 21 Sept. 1800 (E 710).  In his letters of this period these images of ascent—of release from  the pit, of resurrection, of shaking off the earth—eventually take the  form of a specific and repeated biblical topos that derives from Genesis  28: 

And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward  Haran. And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night,  because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and  put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. And he  dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it  reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending  on it. And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD  God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou  liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as  the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to  the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy  seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. And, behold, I am  with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will  bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I  have done that which I have spoken to thee of. And Jacob awaked out of  his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it  not. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is  none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.  (Genesis 28.10-17)
 This passage shares with the visions discussed earlier (of Ezekiel,  Paul, John, and of Blake himself) the possibility of ascent into heaven  and of encounter with the divine. The passage  also narrates Jacob’s exile and wandering, and the establishment of a  new covenant between him and God, which Blake appropriates to  conceptualize his own changed circumstances as he moves from the  political and religious ferment of 1790s London to beginning a new  century in this quiet, south-coast seaside village.For Blake’s visceral response to contemporary London, see the letter to Cumberland, 1 Sept. 1800 (Bentley, Blake Records 95-97).  This new covenant characterizes Blake’s new life in his reestablished  connections with God, with friendships, and with artistic inspiration. 
In the correspondence of this period Blake clearly envisages Jacob’s  ladder as beginning in heaven and descending in a spiral over Felpham,  winding around the Turret (his new place of work) to arrive at his own  cottage door. In verses enclosed in a letter to Anna Flaxman, he writes: 

Away to Sweet Felpham for Heaven is there The Ladder of Angels descends thro the air On the Turret its spiral does softly descend Thro’ the village then winds at My Cot i[t] does end  You stand in the village and look up to heaven The precious stones glitter on flights seventy seven And My Brother is there and My Friend and Thine Descend and Ascend with the Bread and the Wine  The Bread of sweet Thought and the Wine of Delight Feeds the Village of Felpham by day and by night And at his own door the blessd Hermit does stand Dispensing Unceasing to all the whole LandMrs. Blake to Mrs. Flaxman, 14 Sept. 1800 (E 709).
 Blake’s mention of his “Brother” could refer to Hayley,Hayley is, presumably, the “blessd Hermit” of the penultimate line.  but in this inspirational context, with angels ascending and descending  from heaven, it seems more likely to refer to his dead brother Robert,  with whom Blake continues to “converse daily and hourly in the Spirit.”Blake to Hayley, 6 May 1800 (E 705). The imagery of the new covenant is emphasized through the bread and wine elements of the Last Supper,Matthew 26.26-29; Mark 14.22-25; Luke 22.13-20. and the “seventy seven” flights of steps perhaps correspond to the forgiveness of sins that Blake considers central to Christianity.“Then  came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against  me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say  not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven”  (Matthew 18.21-22); Blake: “Forgiveness of Sins This alone is the Gospel  and this is the Life and Immortality brought to light by Jesus” (E  875). The “precious stones” may relate to the stones of Genesis  28.11, while the “house of God” and the “gate of heaven” of Genesis  28.17 are likewise, Blake suggests, to be found in Felpham itself: 
Felpham is a sweet place for Study.  because it is more Spiritual than London  Heaven opens here on  all sides her golden Gates  her windows are not obstructed by  vapours.  voices of Celestial inhabitants are more distinctly  heard and their forms more distinctly seen and my Cottage is also a  Shadow of their houses.Blake to Flaxman, 21 Sept. 1800 (E 710).
 
Blake’s particular uses of Jacob’s ladder in  the correspondence of this period have a striking visual counterpart in  his undated watercolor Jacob’s Ladder.He exhibited the picture as both Jacob’s Dream and Jacob’s Ladder; see Butlin 1: 338 (#438).

 The subject is not new, as there is a long-standing iconographical  tradition depicting this famous biblical scene, in which Jacob is  typically presented as lying asleep, with the ladder taking the form of a  beam of light leading up into the sun. Blake is certainly conscious of such works,See, for example, Ludovico Cardi da Cigoli’s Jacob’s Dream (1593); Johann Wilhelm Baur’s Jacob’s Dream (c. 1600-40); Michael Willmann’s Landscape with the Dream of Jacob (1691); Aert de Gelder’s Jacob’s Dream (c. 1710-15). Blake certainly knew Raphael’s painting of this subject (see Beer 31-32).  and in characteristic fashion he follows the tradition, but also  recasts it: his use of a spiral staircase in this context is, as Anthony  Blunt puts it, “a complete novelty in the iconography of this subject.”Quoted in Paley 200.  Yet it is not a complete novelty in Blake’s work because it is the very  image used in the poem to Anna Flaxman. Like the painting, his poem  describes not a “Ladder” with rungs, but one with seventy-seven  “flights” of stairs glittering with precious stones and—as in his  painting—that staircase is specifically “spiral.” Moreover, at the  bottom of the staircase in the painting are two angels carrying a basket  of bread (with some grapes and vine leaves) and a pitcher of what is  presumably wine; again these are not part of the iconographical  tradition of the subject (nor of the Genesis narrative), yet they  correlate to the poem, in which “My Friend and Thine / Descend and Ascend with the Bread and the Wine.”This  Eucharistic inflection may derive from Jesus’s apparent reference to  the Genesis passage when he proclaims “Hereafter ye shall see heaven  open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of  man” (John 1.51). Blake also includes not just angels but humans  (including friends, lovers, infants, and children) on his ladder, a  populous world which, like the letters of this period, is full of  angels. Blake calls Hayley “Leader of My Angels” (16 Sept. 1800 [E  709]); his “Dear Flaxman” is “a Sublime Archangel” (21 Sept. 1800 [E  710]); Butts is the “Dear Friend of My Angels” (23 Sept. 1800 [E 711]);  “the time is now arrivd when Men shall again converse in Heaven and  walk with Angels” (to Flaxman, 12 Sept. 1800 [E 707]); and, in one of  the more flighty passages, Blake is “more famed in Heaven” for his works  than he “could well concieve” because in his brain “are studies and  Chambers filld with books and pictures of old,” which he “wrote and  painted in ages of Eternity” before his mortal life, and those “works  are the delight and Study of Archangels” (to Flaxman, 21 Sept. 1800 [E  710]). 
This continuity between Blake’s painting and his poem to Mrs. Flaxman  is striking. It is more than just his painting a subject that is a  presiding metaphor in his correspondence at this time: his images and  letters share certain specifics that are part of neither the original  Genesis narrative nor the iconographical tradition of the subject, and  that do not occur together elsewhere in his corpus. Their  conjugation suggests, although does not prove, that the painting may  have been composed around the time of Blake’s move to Felpham.It  is currently dated c. 1799-1806 by the British Museum and c. 1805 by  Butlin. The continuity has been noted by Keynes, among others (Letters 21n3). What  is certain is that Blake had the same imagery in his mind at the time  of his relocation and at the time of the composition of the painting.In  the painting, Jacob is lying on the shore of the ocean, a detail that  again is not part of the biblical text or the iconographical tradition,  but is relevant to Blake’s Felpham setting. The painting suggests a  universality through its visual gestures to space, sky, earth, shore,  and sea, indicated respectively by the stars, the clouds immediately  above Jacob’s left arm and staff, the curve of the globe to the right of  his foot, the rocks immediately under his right arm and side, and the  waves lapping against those rocks to the bottom left of the picture (the  waves resemble, for example, those in pl. 1 of Visions of the Daughters of Albion [copy O] and pl. 10 of The Marriage [copy H]).  This contiguity of imagery allows us to ask what light the shared  elements of Blake’s painting and the poem to Mrs. Flaxman might shed on Landscape near Felpham and “To my Friend Butts,” for the image of Jacob’s ladder has strong resonances in those works.
 
As I mentioned earlier, the iconographical tradition of the Jacob  story typically presents the ladder as a crepuscular ray, and this is  echoed in the naturalistic Landscape near Felpham, in which the rays descend from the sun to the cottage, just as the ladder “at My Cot” “does end” in the poem to Anna Flaxman. In  “To my Friend Butts” there is, likewise, a great emphasis on the rays  of the sun: not only the “Glorious beams” pouring from “Heavens high  Streams”These “streams” in heaven may also echo the fountains and river of Revelation and Butts’s poem discussed earlier.  and “the Streams / Of Heavens bright beams” that Blake stands in  immediately prior to finding himself above Felpham, but also the “beams  of bright gold” that enfold his limbs. The  correlation to the iconographical tradition discussed above is clear:  Blake’s journey with the particles of light into the sky above Felpham  and into the bosom of God/Jesus is a figuration of the ascent of Jacob’s  ladder among angels, who for Blake—as many of his paintings show—were  beings of light.See, for example, his c. 1803-05 watercolor Angel of the Revelation.  “To my Friend Butts” reconfirms numerous other elements anticipated in  the letters: the transformation of Felpham into a gateway to heaven; the  focus on the immediacy of firsthand experience; the glittering stones  (anticipating the “particles bright”); and the vision of Blake’s  “Brother” and “Friend” (in “To my Friend Butts” Blake sees his “Sister  and Friend”).
 
This material is characterized by the coexistence and interplay of naturalistic and symbolic elements. In Blake’s Jacob’s Ladder,  a painting rich in symbolism, we might expect to find “the Lord”  standing above the top of the ladder as the text states (Genesis 28.13),  but instead we find a comparatively naturalistic sun (from which rays  emanate, but they do not form the staircase); in Landscape near Felpham,  the rays of sunshine that fall on Blake’s cottage may be naturalistic,  but, as Lister notes, they also seem to serve a symbolic function.Lister (pl. 25) suggests that the “sunbeam” is “perhaps meant to denote the light of inspiration shining on his home.”  Again, in “To my Friend Butts” the richly symbolic narrative of Blake’s  ascent into the bosom of God/Jesus to be purged of the “mire” and the  “clay” resonates with the language of baptism, resurrection, and  transfiguration. Yet it can also be read as a naturalistic account of a  man sitting on the beach enjoying the wonderful sensation of basking in  sunshine. Neither reading negates the other, as this body of work is  monistic: it is simultaneously earthly and heavenly, and there is no  dividing line between naturalistic and symbolic content, or between  material and spiritual elements.
 
This continuity is still more fully realized in Milton, the  prophetic poem that reaches its climax with Blake’s vision of Milton in  his cottage garden at Felpham. The vision is complicated, so I will  first recap some of its key (bewildering) events. Blake is in his garden  when Ololon (approximately Milton’s emanation) descends in the form of  “a Virgin of twelve years” and speaks to him (36.17, E 137). Milton’s  Shadow also descends, though his form is rather more complex, as he is  the Covering Cherub, appearing as “the Wicker Man of Scandinavia”  (37.11, E 137). He is large and contains multitudes: inside him is  Satan, and inside Satan is Rahab. Also inside him are the “Monstrous  Churches of Beulah” and “the Gods of Ulro dark” (37.16, E 137), yet he  nonetheless appears as the Puritan of tradition, dressed in black (38.8,  E 138). While this is happening, the Spectre of Satan is roaring on the  sea “upon mild Felpham shore” (38.13, E 139) and rolling his thunders  against Milton. Rather than describing Satan from the vantage point of  his cottage garden, Blake enters into Satan’s bosom (38.15, E 139), and  from there shows Satan as a “ruind building of God not made with hands”  (38.16, E 139) where Mystery Babylon dwells and where Jerusalem is bound  in chains. Milton now addresses Satan, announcing that he (Milton) is  come in self-annihilation, an act that will simultaneously annihilate  Satan. Satan counters aggressively with the claim that he himself is  “God the judge of all,” and that Milton must fall down and worship him  (39.51-53, E 139).
 
Events now intensify. The “Starry Seven” are burning on Blake’s path,  making it “a solid fire, as bright / As the clear Sun” as “Milton  silent” comes down upon it (39.3-5, E 140). Calling on Albion to awake,  “Forms / Human” go forth from the limbs of the Starry Seven, forming a  “mighty Column of Fire / Surrounding Felphams Vale, reaching to the  Mundane Shell” (39.8-10, E 140). Meanwhile, Satan is “Howling in his  Spectre” (39.18, E 140), and in this final stage of the confrontation  with Milton extends his claim to divinity by appearing in the likeness  of God, surrounded by inversions of the four beasts or ZoasSee, for example, Ezekiel chapter 1 and Revelation chapter 4.  (Satan’s are Chaos, Sin, Death, and Ancient Night [39.22-30, E 140]).  Albion hears the call of the Starry Seven, but has not the strength to  respond. Seeing in Satan his own “embodied Spectre” he tries to “walk  into the Deep” at Felpham (his left foot is on the nearby “Rocks of  Bognor”), but his strength fails and “with dreadful groans” he sinks  back onto his couch (39.46-51, E 141).
 
Ololon speaks conciliatory words to Milton, confessing her own part  in creating a destructive natural religion (Rahab), and immediately  Rahab Babylon herself appears in Satan’s bosom (40.17-20, E 141). Milton  replies to Ololon that he has come in self-annihilation and to renounce  the “Selfhood, which must be put off and annihilated alway / To  cleanse the Face of my Spirit by Self-examination” (40.36-37, E 142).  His sixfold emanations (in one sense the wives and daughters he was alienated from during his earthly life)“Those three females whom his Wives, and those three whom his Daughters / Had represented and containd” (17.1-2, E 110).  now separate from Ololon and reenter Milton’s Shadow, thereby  rehumanizing him (42.3-6, E 143). The Starry Seven of earlier in the  scene have now become a “Starry Eight” through the reintegration of  Milton. Ololon as “a Moony Ark” descends “to Felphams Vale,” while the  Starry Eight are transfigured into “One Man Jesus the Saviour” and the  “Clouds of Ololon” fold round his limbs “as a Garment dipped in blood”  (42.10-12, E 143). Jesus walks forth from Felpham’s vale to enter  Albion’s bosom, while Blake falls outstretched on his path (much as John  of Patmos falls at Jesus’s feet in Revelation 1.17); the lark mounts  with a loud trill (the moment of dawn), and among final apocalyptic  images, the poem ends (42.19-20, 25, 29, E 143).
 
Like the works discussed earlier, Milton consistently  expresses continuities between the naturalistic and symbolic and the  material and spiritual, not least through its characters, who are (among  other things) both psychic forces and natural phenomena: Los appears as the sun,In  Blake’s second letter to Butts of 22 November 1802, mentioned above,  the verses include a description of Los as the sun: “Then Los appeard in  all his power / In the Sun he appeard descending before / My face in  fierce flames in my double sight / Twas outward a Sun: inward Los in his  might” (E 722). In Milton there is a corresponding passage:  “Los descended to me: / And Los behind me stood; a terrible flaming Sun:  just close / Behind my back; I turned round in terror, and behold. /  Los stood in that fierce glowing fire” (22 [24].5-8, E 116-17). This  bears a resemblance to the union with the “One Man” of “To my Friend  Butts,” and perhaps explains why Sloss and Wallis identify this figure  as Los (see note 31, above). Ololon as the moon  (42.7, E 143), Milton as lightning (20.26, E 114), as a cloud (21.36, E  116), and so on. Yet there is a still closer association to the earlier  Felpham material, again centered on the topos of Jacob’s ladder. The  connection is brought to light by the phrase “paved work,” which occurs  three times in Milton’s climactic scene (38.6, E 138; 39.24, E  140; 40.18, E 141). What is this “paved work”? Behind the vision of  Satan stands a biblical vision of the lawgiver God of Exodus. Exodus  24.10 states that the Israelites “saw the God of Israel: and there was  under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it  were the body of heaven in his clearness.”God  promises the “tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have  written” to Moses just two verses later (Exodus 24.12). The image of  Satan “Coming in a Cloud with Trumpets and with Fiery Flame” (39.23, E  140) points us to neighboring passages such as Exodus 19.16-20.  Blake (like many interpreters) takes the clear blue “paved work” as the  sky itself. Milton “descend[s]” on this paved work, and it offers a  passage between heaven and earth in the same manner as Jacob’s ladder: 

Milton collecting all his fibres into impregnable strength Descended down a Paved work of all kinds of precious stones Out from the eastern sky; descending down into my Cottage Garden: clothed in black, severe and silent he descended. (38.5-8, E 138)
 Here the “Paved work” corresponds to the night  sky, and the “precious stones” are the stars, something we have seen  before in the letter to Mrs. Flaxman, where the “precious stones”  glitter on the “flights” of steps.In book 1 of Milton, Satan turns the translucent “paved terraces” of his interior into the blackness of space as he shuts out the divine vision: Thus Satan rag’d amidst the Assembly! and his bosom grew Opake against the Divine Vision: the paved terraces of His bosom inwards shone with fires, but the stones becoming opake! Hid him from sight, in an extreme blackness and darkness, And there a World of deeper Ulro was open’d, in the midst Of the Assembly. In Satans bosom a vast unfathomable Abyss. (9.30-35, E 103) The stars are also depicted in Blake’s painting of Jacob’s ladder surrounding the lower flights of the stairs, and in two of the major Milton  images (pls. 29 and 33) we see stars about to enter the feet of Blake  and his brother Robert, who stand next to what looks like—as Erdman  points out—“the lower steps of Jacob’s ladder in Blake’s watercolor.”“We  see that the stones of Satan’s paved terraces that had grown opaque  have in an instant recovered their original glory as a luminous  hewn-stone ladder of returning and going forth. They may properly remind  us of the lower steps of Jacob’s ladder in Blake’s watercolor” (Erdman,  “The Steps” 82). 
Satan too stands on this “bright Paved-work / Of precious stones,” again in darkness: 

Loud Satan thunderd, loud and dark upon mild Felphams Shore Coming in a Cloud with Trumpets and with Fiery Flame An awful Form eastward from midst of a bright Paved-work Of precious stones by Cherubim surrounded: so permitted (Lest he should fall apart in his Eternal Death) to imitate  The Eternal Great Humanity Divine surrounded by His Cherubim and Seraphim in ever happy Eternity Beneath sat Chaos: Sin on his right hand Death on his left And Ancient Night spread over all the heavn his Mantle of Laws. (39.22-30, E 140)
 The paved work of Exodus also appears as the sky of day, as we see in  its final iteration when Rahab-Babylon appears as the sun in the east: 
Rahab Babylon appeard Eastward upon the Paved work across Europe and Asia  Glorious as the midday Sun in Satans bosom glowing. (40.17-19, E 141)
 In Milton then, the “paved work”  corresponds to the skies of both day and night, and this too is  consistent with Blake’s watercolor of Jacob’s ladder, in the lower half  of which it is night and stars shine, while in the upper half the sun  blazes its glorious rays.The similarity of the “paved work” to the ladder of Blake’s picture does not extend to its taking a spiral form, yet Milton  is nonetheless full of spiral images. Los (himself the sun) has taken  Blake from Lambeth to Felpham in a “whirlwind” (36.21, E 137); the  flight of the lark is a spiral ascent; the “Ears in close volutions /  Shot spiring out in the deep darkness” (3.17-18, E 97); and infinity is  described as a “vortex” that is expressly linked to the sun, moon, and  stars: The nature of infinity is this: That every thing has its Own Vortex; and when once a traveller thro Eternity. Has passd that Vortex, he percieves it roll backward behind His path, into a globe itself infolding; like a sun: Or like a moon, or like a universe of starry majesty. (15.21-25, E 109) 
The same luminescent passage to the heavens springs up from Blake’s garden in the climax to Milton,  as the Starry Seven take on “Forms / Human” and stand “in a mighty  Column of Fire” reaching from Felpham to the sky (39.8-9, E 140).The  “Column of Fire” is yet another human-formed connection between heaven  and earth, and also evokes the “pillar of fire” found in Exodus 13.21-22  and elsewhere. As they do so, they integrate with Milton, and  thereby become “One Man Jesus the Saviour” (42.11, E 143). This column  of shining human forms is strongly reminiscent of the “Heavenly Men  beaming bright” who likewise appear as “One Man” who enfolds Blake in  his “bosom sun bright” and makes himself known to Blake, as I suggested  earlier, as Jesus. Yet what is so extraordinary about Blake’s  redeployment of the Felpham vision in Milton is that he not only uses it in his vision of Jesus, but also in his vision of Satan: 

The Spectre of Satan stood upon the roaring sea and beheld Milton within his sleeping Humanity! trembling and shuddring He stood upon the waves a Twenty-seven-fold mighty Demon Gorgeous and beautiful: loud roll his thunders against Milton Loud Satan thunderd, loud and dark upon mild Felpham shore Not daring to touch one fibre he howld round upon the Sea.  I also stood in Satans bosom and beheld its desolations! A ruind Man: a ruind building of God not made with hands; Its plains of burning sand, its mountains of marble terrible: Its pits and declivities flowing with molten ore and fountains Of pitch and nitre: its ruind palaces and cities and mighty works; Its furnaces of affliction in which his Angels and Emanations Labour with blackend visages among its stupendous ruins Arches and pyramids and porches colonades and domes: In which dwells Mystery Babylon, here is her secret place From hence she comes forth on the Churches in delight Here is her Cup filld with its poisons, in these horrid vales And here her scarlet Veil woven in pestilence and war: Here is Jerusalem bound in chains, in the Dens of Babylon. (38.9-27, E 139)
 As in “To my Friend Butts,” Blake sees an anthropomorphic vision over  the sea at Felpham and enters into its bosom. The view from that bosom  likewise opens onto sands and mountains, but they are “burning” and  “terrible,” and rather than “Felpham sweet,” Blake sees “ruind palaces  and cities.” This is no longer the mountain of the Lord as imagined by IsaiahSee note 33, above. and “To my Friend Butts,” but the mountain of the God of Exodus, the Hell of Paradise Lost,  and the dwelling place of Babylon where Jerusalem is bound in chains.  The beings of light are now “Angels and Emanations” with “blackend  visages,” and the journey into the sun is not a journey into God, but  into Rahab Babylon, who appears “Glorious as the midday Sun in Satans  bosom glowing.” 
Why do this? It seems extraordinary that rather than keeping the  divine vision of “To my Friend Butts” in his heart, safe from  contamination, Blake redeploys it as a vision of Satan that is so  appalling, so sublime, that the reiteration is not even immediately  obvious. One possibility is that he felt he had been deluded by Felpham and wished to revoke his vision,There are lines in Milton  that would support this idea. The poem provides a sustained critique of  “Natural Religion,” and it may be that Blake felt that he had been  deceived by nature at Felpham, committing to its delights in a way that  subsequently betrayed him (he was initially delighted by it, but  Catherine became ill and things fell apart): My Vegetated portion was hurried from Lambeths shades He set me down in Felphams Vale and prepard a beautiful Cottage for me that in three years I might write all these Visions To display Natures cruel holiness: the deceits of Natural Religion[.] (36.22-25, E 137)  but the redeployment seems to me entirely consistent with Blake’s wider  work. As he never tires of showing, meaning cannot be legislated or  restricted by narratives. Blake’s “infernal” readings of Paradise Lost and the book of Job in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell and of the early chapters of Genesis in The Book of Urizen  offer striking examples of this. Throughout his work, he draws our  attention to the fact that art provides us not with meanings, but with  narrative—or imaginative—structures (such as those of Paradise Lost  and the Bible) wherein meaning may be sought, contested, found, or  relinquished. This applies even to his own work, such that the Felpham  “Vision of Light” can be renarrated as an instance of “Single vision  and Newtons sleep,” disclosing, among other things, the apocalyptic  horror of an England that has come to regard reason as the only true  understanding, and materialism as its core (and only) reality.
 
Blake develops this hermeneutic through his  concept of fourfold vision, whereby the difference between being a  haunted failure living in a dead universe and becoming an individual who  has “traveld thro Perils and Darkness not unlike a Champion” to  conquer and to “Go on Conquering … among the Stars of God and in the  Abysses of the Accuser” is not about living in different worlds, but  about seeing the same world at a more fully human level.The  move from the former to the latter is enacted autobiographically in  “With happiness stretchd across the hills,” the poem from the second  letter to Butts of 22 November 1802, which narrates Blake’s recovery  from depression to fourfold vision (E 720-22). The quotations in the  text are from another letter to Butts of the same day (E 720). He  suggests that our lives, our experiences, just as much as our art, are  narrative structures, and that the content of those structures is not  fixed. Salvation from the satanic nightmare, Blake suggests, involves  ascending Jacob’s ladder, being raised to the divine-human level of  vision through the incorporation and integration of the different  aspects of our humanity, both individual and corporate. Hence the  redemption of Milton—who has become dehumanized through his estrangement  from his emanation—depends on his being restored to the fullness of his  personhood. This is a familiar theme in Blake’s works, in which  Albion’s redemption depends on the reintegration of his four Zoas and  their emanations.
 
This process of redemption is not incidental to Blake’s work; it is  its central theme and its method, as his art enacts the ongoing labor of  reopening and reconnecting closed-off aspects of our humanity (both as  individuals and as societies). Yet it is a difficult topic to discuss,  and the satanic (fallen) and divine (redeemed) versions of the Felpham  vision bring into clear focus the challenge raised in any account of  Blake’s “religion”: however preferable the latter  is to the former, the two cannot be permanently split apart, as they  constitute different aspects of what we are.Even  at a formal level their continuity is evident. They cannot be divided  along an earthly-heavenly axis, as they are equally biblical, epiphanic,  and “religious.” Like “To my Friend Butts,” the Milton passage  is couched in the language and imagery of Revelation, which is drawn on  to depict Babylon’s dominion over the churches. In Revelation 13.1  John, like Blake, “stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise  up out of the sea.” The complexity of Blake’s prophetic books  suggests how difficult it is to hold on to this central truth, and it  has proved evasive in the reception history of his work. That reception  is characterized by an antagonistic division of “religious” and  “secular” outlooks, and a bifurcation of “transcendent” and  “materialist” interpretations into two worldviews that have little  interest in one another. Hence, in the case of “To my Friend Butts,” I  suggested earlier that the transcendent character of the poem has  assured its sustained presence in non-academic appropriations of Blake  (particularly in anthologies of mystical writing), and that this has  evolved with a concomitant disregard for the material context of the  vision (the abridged poem is invariably presented as a self-sufficient  and self-explanatory entity). In academic  studies, the reverse has been true: the scholarly discussion of Blake  and religion continues to flourish, and since the early 1990s in  particular has sought a more detailed understanding of the material and  cultural contexts of Blake’s religion,Blake is at the heart of the ferment of interest in London’s dissenting subcultures catalyzed by Jon Mee’s Dangerous Enthusiasm (1992) and discussed in a range of subsequent works, including E. P. Thompson’s Witness against the Beast (1993), Robert Rix’s William Blake and the Cultures of Radical Christianity (2007), Magnus Ankarsjö’s William Blake and Religion (2009), and a host of essay collections and journal articles.  which has often been cast as a historical concern with his  denominational affiliations (Anglican, Moravian, Muggletonian,  Swedenborgian). This conversation has been correspondingly less engaged  with the transcendent aspects of Blake’s work, and “To my Friend Butts”  has not featured in it. The depth and pervasiveness of this  religious/secular binary can be seen in the astonishing claim made  in one recent critical work that Blake “flaunted his secular  religiousness deliberately by constantly writing of God and Christ even  though he was an atheist and an unbeliever.”See Quinney 25-26. This  is the same Blake who wrote in one of the letters to Butts discussed  earlier, “I still and shall to Eternity Embrace Christianity and Adore  him who is the Express image of God,” and for whom Milton is  the means to “cast off” “the destroyers of Jerusalem … the murderers /  Of Jesus, who deny the Faith and mock at Eternal Life.”22 Nov. 1802 (E 720); Milton 41.12, 21-22 (E 142).
 
My aim in showing the range of literary and biographical contexts  within which “To my Friend Butts” occurs has been to reconnect its  material and transcendent aspects. By giving a different perspective on  this material, I have tried to show that the sketch and poem (and the  later reworking in Milton) offer an account of the undoing, or  integration, of the material/transcendent dyad, as Blake’s religious  experience turns out to be neither material nor transcendent but both,  because the two entities are ultimately revealed to be different aspects  of the same human-divine reality. How so? Let me recap. Blake begins a  new life in Felpham in 1800. He conceptualizes that change through a  small group of biblical topoi that center on new life through a divine  covenant. He is so deeply grounded in the Bible that the  conceptualization is, as it were, natural to his self-understanding, and  fills his correspondence to friends at the time. Shortly after  beginning this life he experiences a vision that constitutes a  fulfillment of the anticipated covenant. He reports this epiphany among  the domestic details of an affectionate letter to a friend. The vision  is expressed in the same relaxed, amicable, first-person voice as the  correspondence in which it appears. In comparison with the author’s  other work, it betrays few signs of intellectual struggle or rhetorical  forcefulness. Nonetheless, it gently engages the local landscape, the  visions and poetry of his correspondent, his own readings from  Swedenborg and Newton, and a wide range of biblical texts, while  bringing together the living, the dead, the past, and the future. It  provides an integration of past time into the present (“All I ever had  known / Before me bright Shone”); an integration of God and the  individual as the narrator is incorporated into the divine humanity (“In  his bosom sun bright / I remaind”); an integration of humanity and  natural phenomena (stones, rocks, hills, herbs, trees become men, “Human  formd”); an integration of epistemology (Newtonian physics,  Swedenborgian theology, and biblical narrative are harmonized); and an  experiential integration in the narrator (the transcendent elements are  inseparable from the domestic context and affections). In addition to  all this, the vision has a visual counterpart, a sketch that is realist  in execution, yet which shares the same quiet joy. The continuity of  material and transcendent elements across the two works testifies that  earth and heaven, humanity and God constitute a single reality for Blake  at this time. In sum, the trauma of a divided universe—elsewhere the  great drama of Blake’s work—is healed for a moment with a wonderful  lightness of touch as the poem performs the work of integration. That  lightness may come from all the things that the poem and sketch are  willing to relinquish: in their mildness they let go of the vatic  authorial persona of Milton and Jerusalem; of the dramatis personae of the prophecies; of the political, social, and psychological critique of the Songs; of the theological polemic of The Marriage;  and of the righteous indignation of the letter to Dr. Trusler.  Paradoxically, Blake’s most intimate, autobiographical lyric and its  visual counterpart are the least “Blakean” instances of his art that we  possess.
 
Yet Blake does not enshrine this quiet vision, but instead gives its  life to a prophetic poem in which it can also stand as a structure of  ruination. By doing so, he reminds us that the sacred and the secular  must not be used as categories to split the universe in two, for if we  encounter them in the fullness of our humanity, they are not divisible  phenomena outside us, but living continuities within. Similarly, the act  of separating and reifying single aspects of life—whether biographical,  natural, rational, sexual, political, religious, material, historical,  or whatever—constitutes, in Blake’s terms, the error of the unredeemed  Milton, of Urizen, of the twenty-seven churches, and, as the preface to Milton puts it, of the hirelings in the camp, the court, and (more than ever) the university. It is, to borrow from The Marriage,  to take portions of existence and fancy that the whole. What then is  Blake’s alternative? He is an unrelenting critic of the Bible, of  religion, and of the churches, but he is also a Christological“Christological” is not really the right word, as his concern is principally with Jesus, but “Jesusological” seems awkward.  artist, for whom Christianity meant the integration of what we have  culturally divided into the human and the divine, the material and the  transcendent. His work is everywhere concerned with human integration  (both within individuals and between people), which is to say building  Jerusalem and restoring Albion. However, as for Wordsworth, developing a  unified vision of the world requires labor, and Blake’s Christianity is  emphatically not constituted by passive intellectual assent to a static  corpus of propositions. Rather, it is concerned with striving to  participate in a living body of humanity that Blake calls “the Divine  Body of the Lord Jesus” (Milton 3.4, E 96). The work of that  process of integration is—in Blake’s terms—the work of art: “Prayer is  the Study of Art / Praise is the Practise of Art,” as he would later  write in Laocoön (E 274), and this process of building Jerusalem also means—as Milton  shows—rehumanizing the material universe so that it is no longer the  alienated “Newtonian Voids between the Substances of Creation” (37.46, E  138). Blake’s work calls for, and exemplifies, a life that is not  reduced either to separate categories of the material and the  transcendent, or to the disciplinary divisions of academia. So, where  then do “visions and revelations” such as that of “To my Friend Butts”  take place? They occur where the separation of human and divine, spirit  and body is relinquished; to borrow from Paul the Apostle’s own account,  “whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I  cannot tell: God knoweth” (2 Corinthians 12.1-2).

To my Friend Butts I write
 
My first Vision of Light
 
On the yellow sands sitting
 
The Sun was Emitting
 
His Glorious beams
 
From Heavens high Streams
 
Over Sea over Land
 
My Eyes did Expand
 
Into regions of air
 
Away from all Care
 
Into regions of fire
 
Remote from Desire
 
The Light of the Morning
 
Heavens Mountains adorning
 
In particles bright
 
The jewels of Light
 
Distinct shone and clear—
 
Amazd and in fear
 
I each particle gazed
 
Astonishd Amazed
 
For each was a Man
 
Human formd. Swift I ran
 
For they beckond to me
 
Remote by the Sea
 
Saying. Each grain of Sand
 
Every Stone on the Land
 
Each rock and each hill
 
Each fountain and rill
 
Each herb and each tree
 
Mountain hill Earth and Sea
 
Cloud Meteor and Star
 
Are Men Seen Afar
 
I stood in the Streams
 
Of Heavens bright beams
 
And Saw Felpham sweet
 
Beneath my bright feet
 
In soft Female charms
 
And in her fair arms
 
My Shadow I knew
 
And my wifes shadow too
 
And My Sister and Friend.
 
We like Infants descend
 
In our Shadows on Earth
 
Like a weak mortal birth
 
My Eyes more and more
 
Like a Sea without shore
 
Continue Expanding
 
The Heavens commanding
 
Till the Jewels of Light
 
Heavenly Men beaming bright
 
Appeard as One Man
 
Who Complacent began
 
My limbs to infold
 
In his beams of bright gold
 
Like dross purgd away
 
All my mire and my clay
 
Soft consumd in delight
 
In his bosom sun bright
 
I remaind. Soft he smild
 
And I heard his voice Mild
 
Saying This is My Fold
 
O thou Ram hornd with gold
 
Who awakest from sleep
 
On the sides of the Deep
 
On the Mountains around
 
The roarings resound
 
Of the lion and wolf
 
The loud sea and deep gulf
 
These are guards of My Fold
 
O thou Ram hornd with gold
 
And the voice faded mild
 
I remaind as a Child
 
All I ever had known
 
Before me bright Shone

R. Paul Yoder (rpyoder@ualr.edu)  is a professor of English at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.  He is the author of articles on Milton, Alexander Pope, Samuel  Richardson, Thomas Gray, Blake, and Wordsworth.  His book, The Narrative Structure of William Blake’s Poem Jerusalem: A Revisionist Interpretation, was published by the Edwin Mellen Press in 2010.  He has also co-edited, with Wallace Jackson, two essay collections on Pope.
 
 
 
Every reader brings his or her own strengths to Blake’s Jerusalem. Susanne Sklar’s strength lies in her biblical and theological background, and in Blake’s Jerusalem as Visionary Theatre: Entering the Divine Body,  she identifies an extensive range of biblical references and echoes in  Blake’s masterpiece, while she also embeds the poem in the context of  various eighteenth-century social and religious movements, including  Freemasonry, Moravianism, and the Messianism of Joanna Southcott. Sklar  also wants to use the notion of “visionary theatre” to show that Jerusalem  can be read both synchronically (holistically, like a painting) and  diachronically (for its story and plot). However, she is more successful  at deploying the biblical and theological context than with applying  the visionary theatre aspect, and the result is a discussion without a  clear overall thesis.
 
It is worth noting at the outset that Sklar uses copy E of Jerusalem as the base text for her reading, rather than the more commonly used copy A. As most readers know, Jerusalem  exists in two forms: copies A, C, and F exhibit one sequence of plates  in chapter 2, while copies D and E exhibit another. For many years,  David Erdman’s edition of Blake’s work has been the standard critical  text, and since he uses the A-C-F sequence, most discussions of Jerusalem have been based on that. However, twenty years ago, Joseph Viscomi showed that the copy D-E sequence is in fact Blake’s final intention for the poem.Joseph Viscomi, Blake and the Idea of the Book (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993) 339-41.  Nonetheless, the ready availability and authority of Erdman’s edition  have meant that most work on the poem is still based on the A-C-F  sequence. Thus Sklar’s decision reflects a shift in the textual  assumptions underpinning critical approaches to the poem. This shift has  been encouraged by the increasing availability of facsimiles of copy E,  both in the Blake Trust edition of 1991 and in the online Blake Archive.  Indeed, Sklar suggests that the reader keep the facsimile open while  reading her commentary. This advice is useful because she makes more  effort than most to integrate interpretations of the illuminations with  the interpretations of the text. Also, much of her commentary refers to  conversations she had about the illuminations with other scholars while  working with copy E itself at the Yale Center for British Art.
 
The book opens with an introduction that includes what is now a fairly standard review of the literary criticism of Jerusalem.  She covers most of the important critics (Ellis and Yeats, Gilchrist,  Damon, Frye, Erdman, Wittreich, Mitchell, Paley, Doskow, Witke, and  Dortort), as well as some more theologically oriented writers such as J.  G. Davies and Thomas Altizer, and a good number of others. After the  introduction, the book is divided into two major parts: Part I:  Perspectives, Characters, Settings, and Part II: The Commentary. Part I  introduces the notion of “Visionary Theatre” and the related issue of  “Dramatis Personae” before focusing more specifically on “Jerusalem: Her  Character and Context,” “Jerusalem’s Jesus,” and “Shifting  Settings—Building Projects.” Part II offers a chapter-by-chapter  discussion of Blake’s poem, leading up to an “Encore” that somewhat  belatedly returns to the issue of the synchronic reading of Jerusalem.
 
Part I sets up an admirable context that promises much for the more  detailed reading of the poem. The strengths here lie in the extensive  detail that Sklar brings to the context she creates for the poem. For  example, like Morton Paley and Vincent De Luca, she makes much of the  influence of Joseph Mede’s Clavis Apocalyptica (Key to the Revelation) on Jerusalem,  partly by way of Milton. Paley cites in general terms Joseph  Wittreich’s work on Mede’s influence on Milton, but Sklar includes the  juicy tidbit that Mede was “one of [Milton’s] Cambridge tutors” and that  Clavis Apocalyptica was published “during Milton’s second year  at Christ’s College” (22). Similarly, while the influence of  Freemasonry on Blake has been discussed by earlier critics such as  Stuart Peterfreund, Sklar emphasizes the influence via Blake’s master  during his apprenticeship, James Basire, noting both the assertion by  Hamill and Gilbert that “Basire was ‘certainly a member of the Craft’”  (although she admits to having found “no documentary evidence to support  this”) (36) and the fact that the dedication and consecration of the  Freemasons’ Tavern and Hall were “done with pomp and circumstance  directly opposite Basire’s studio and home on Great Queen Street” (37).  In her examination of the character of Jerusalem, Sklar compares her to  Christ, while also creating a context for Blake’s depiction that  includes Jacob Boehme’s Sophia and the evangelist Southcott. In  discussing Blake’s Jesus, she examines the similarities and differences  between Blake’s poem and Edward Young’s Night Thoughts, the epistles of St. Paul, the Moravian Church, and the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg.
 
It is in Sklar’s focus on visionary theatre that her book holds the  most promise. The synchronic readings that have dominated criticism of Jerusalem  for years commonly invoke the notion of “visionary theatre” as it was  applied to Revelation by David Pareus and Mede in the seventeenth  century, but these approaches are now being called into question by a  variety of critics (including myself). Sklar states early that  “visionary theatre allows us to engage with Blake’s composite art both  sequentially and synchronically” (3). This effort to bring the  synchronic and diachronic readings into interplay is an important focus  for future discussions of Jerusalem: it has become increasingly  clear that the synchronic approach does not address important issues in  the poem, such as what constitutes a synchronic fragment, or why Blake  oscillated between two different sequences in chapter 2. Nonetheless,  the synchronic readings cannot simply be dismissed, and at least early  in her book, Sklar tries harder than most to bring the synchronic and  diachronic possibilities of Jerusalem into proximity. Moreover,  she rightly argues that the emphasis on visionary theatre should draw  the reader’s attention to issues of character, motive, dramatic scene or  episode, and setting, elements often ignored in the drive to read Jerusalem as a set of synchronic fragments of a single event.
 
Despite Sklar’s intent to engage the poem both sequentially and  synchronically, her discussion in part I of the characters and their  relationships tends to collapse Blake’s time scheme in a way that  finally misrepresents the drama and action of the poem. For example, she  describes the “erotic spirituality” of Jesus in Jerusalem,  saying that Jerusalem (the character) “flies into the arms of her  bridegroom, who makes her his wife (J20:35-41), and they experience  ‘holy raptures’ on their heavenly couch in their ‘secret chamber’ in  Spain, spreading joy throughout the world (J79)” (107). Sklar is  certainly correct that Blake connected eroticism and spirituality, and  the two quotations she cites are textually accurate, but those  quotations come from scenes at opposite ends of the poem. Moreover, her  description ignores the dramatic context because the actions she  specifies do not happen in the narrative present of the poem. On plate  20, Jerusalem does say that “The Lamb of God … made me his Bride and  Wife” (20.39-40), but this statement occurs in the middle of a scene in  which Jerusalem and Vala are talking about sin, guilt, and forgiveness,  including the latter’s response to what may have been a rape by Albion,  as Jerusalem describes to Vala how he “rent thy Veil,” yet “thou  forgavest his furious love” (20.36-37). Similarly, in the second scene  noted by Sklar in this passage, Jerusalem does describe her love with  the Saviour, but again, that scene is not in the narrative present.  Instead, on plate 79 Jerusalem describes her situation in terms  recalling Ezekiel’s account of the Babylonian exile, especially Ezekiel  chapter 33, in which he reports the destruction of the city of  Jerusalem. Jerusalem’s statements depict that time when she was happier,  before the destruction of the city and the exile of the people. Within  the context of the poem, Sklar’s statements about these relationships  focus on the lost past and a possible future, but not the situation that  confronts Blake’s characters in the drama of Jerusalem’s visionary theatre.
 
The problem is that Sklar lacks an adequate working definition of  “visionary theatre.” She devotes an early chapter to “Visionary  Theatre—Apocalyptic Images,” in which she brings together with Pareus  and Mede the book of Revelation, musicals, alchemy, Boehme, Freemasonry,  and Blake’s oft-noted reference to “Sublime Allegory” (see his letter  to Thomas Butts of 6 July 1803) to construct a web of possible  connections and influences. However, she is more interested in the  “visionary” than the “theatre.” She is more concerned with the  possibility of seeing past, present, and future all at once (22) and  with the characters as “windows to eternity” (43) than with identifying  theatrical scenes that unfold a plot in a narrative present. Following  the chapter on visionary theatre, the bulk of part I is largely a matter  of definitions, using Jerusalem, Jesus, and Blake’s cosmology to  introduce key terms and motifs in the poem. That makes a good  introduction, even though there is little consideration of the details  of the development of the drama. We expect that those details will come  in “The Commentary” of part II.
 
Unfortunately, they do not. Part II should explain how the concept of  visionary theatre helps the reader to identify and interpret individual  scenes and their interrelationships. Instead, the concept mainly serves  to authorize a variety of theatrical metaphors (overture, encore,  curtain call). Ideas about dramatic context, characterization, and  motive introduced in part I, ideas that should be clarified and  crystallized in their application to the sequential details of the poem,  are left vague and ill defined. In part II Sklar provides summaries of  what the characters say without much attention to who is speaking to  whom, where, when, and why. In part I, following the four-point outline  of Revelation suggested by Pareus, Sklar does say, 

When I apply these “vision-divisions” to Jerusalem  I see the structure of its story: Chapter One depicts the calamity of  Albion rejecting the Saviour’s song and Jerusalem’s love; in Chapter  Two, Albion’s cities, friends, and immortals offer comforts; in Chapter  Three, calamities amplify … and in Chapter Four, the Spectrous Selfhood,  or “Anti-christ accursed” (J89:10) is overcome. (21)
 She repeats this outline several times throughout the book, but we  hardly need Pareus, Mede, or any of the modern critics she mentions to  grasp this general chain of events. When Sklar gets down to the  particulars of the drama, she divides Jerusalem’s chapters 1  and 4 into six scenes, and chapters 2 and 3 into seven scenes (plus a  preface and “interval” for each chapter), but she does not explain her  rationale for these divisions, nor does she consider more than in  passing how one set of events relates to the ones that come before and  after it. Part II is basically a paraphrase of the actions described by  the characters in the text; it is not an analysis of those conversations  as dramatic events. 
Sklar provides a fairly detailed sequential summary of the poem, but  she does not explain what defines the dramatic scenes she uses in that  summary. Without a sense of what constitutes a scene change, she fails  to consider how the action of the drama develops. For example, she  offers fairly extensive discussions of the final scenes in Beulah in  chapters 1 and 2 of Jerusalem, but she makes no comment on the  similarity or difference between the cry from Beulah asking the “Lamb of  God” to “take away the imputation of Sin” in chapter 1 (25.12) and the  cry from Beulah in chapter 2 for the “Lamb of God” to “take away the  remembrance of Sin” (50.24, 30). Similarly, she does not comment on the  increase in the arrogance and power of the Spectre evident in the change  from his self-identification—“I am your Rational Power”—in chapter 2,  where he is merely “Worshipd as God” (33.5, 18), to his claim in chapter  3 that “I am God” (54.16). It is in these sorts of progressions that  the details of Jerusalem’s unfolding drama are most evident.  Thus she dismisses as “banal bickering” the important scene in chapter 4  in which the problems of jealousy finally infiltrate into Los’s own  family, despite the fact that the scene parallels Jerusalem’s taking of  the foaming cup from Vala and immediately precedes Los’s consolidation  of error that culminates in the awakening of Albion. That scene is not  banal; it is the climax of the poem.
 
Sklar’s book is a valuable resource for the “prophetic, poetic, and historical sources” (43) informing Jerusalem;  I would add theological sources as well. But the book is also a missed  opportunity to tell us something even more valuable about the structure  of Blake’s masterpiece. Sklar does stipulate at the beginning of her  part II, “I am not arguing that Jerusalem is visionary  theatre or creating a theory about it; I am using this notion as an  approach to the text, an imaginative way of reading that clarifies how  characters, settings, imagery, and action interrelate” (148). I’m just  not convinced that’s enough. Her theatrical metaphors do (or should)  carry meaningful implications for the text to which they are applied.  Why is “visionary theatre” a better way to approach the poem than some  other? I’m still not sure.

With his letter of 18 December 1804, Blake sent two engravings to his Sussex patron, William Hayley. These were proof impressions of “the Shipwreck,” after George Romney’s now lost The Shipwreck at the Cape of Good Hope, and “the Portrait,” a portrait engraving of Romney.The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, ed. David V. Erdman, newly rev. ed. (New York: Anchor–Random House, 1988) [hereafter cited as E] 758. Both were commissioned by Hayley to illustrate his Life of George Romney (1809). Only Blake’s “Sketch of a Shipwreck after Romney,” however, was included in the published biography.Hayley’s Life of Romney  includes twelve engravings, seven by Caroline Watson and the other five  by Blake, Abraham Raimbach, Robert Mitchell Meadows, William Haines,  and Robert Cooper. For Blake’s involvement with the biography, see  Morton D. Paley, “William Blake, George Romney, and The Life of George Romney, Esq.,” Blake 45.2 (fall 2011): 50-65.  Untraced since the 1939 Blake exhibition in Philadelphia, the rejected  portrait engraving derives from Romney’s large, unfinished self-portrait  executed in his forty-ninth year, which is now in the National Portrait Gallery, London.The  evidence that Blake’s engraving is based on this self-portrait by  Romney is set forth in Mark Crosby and Robert N. Essick, “‘the fiends of  Commerce’: Blake’s Letter to William Hayley, 7 August 1804,” Blake 44.2 (fall 2010): 61-63.  The brief catalogue entry for the Philadelphia exhibition describes  Blake’s “portrait of Romney” as a “line engraving” that was “lent by Lessing J. Rosenwald.”William  Blake 1757–1827: A Descriptive Catalogue of an Exhibition of the Works  of William Blake Selected from Collections in the United States (Philadelphia: Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1939) 59, no. 104. Unfortunately, no such print has been located in the Rosenwald Collection, which is now divided between the Library of Congress and the National Gallery of Art, Washington.Ruthven  Todd also refers to this print’s being in the Rosenwald Collection in  his edition of Alexander Gilchrist’s biography of Blake. See Gilchrist, Life of William Blake,  ed. Todd (London: J. M. Dent and Sons; New York: E. P. Dutton, 1942)  380. He repeats this information in his revised edition of 1945 (381).  In a typescript catalogue of Blake’s paintings and drawings, Todd also  claims that “a copy of this rejected plate” is “in the collection of Mr.  Lessing J. Rosenwald … shewn at Philadelphia in 1939” (catalogue now in  the Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress). For the suggestion that  Todd’s statements are based on the entry in the Philadelphia exhibition  catalogue, see Crosby and Essick 63 and n30.
 
An anonymous engraving of Romney after his unfinished self-portrait has come to light.The  print was purchased in 2011 from Grosvenor Prints, London, by the book  dealer John Windle acting for Robert N. Essick. In their online  catalogue, Grosvenor attributed the print to Watson based on her  frontispiece to Hayley’s Life of Romney, which includes a  stipple engraving of the portrait. Watson’s version is very different  from the anonymous print discussed here. This recently discovered print is before all letters, suggesting that it is a proof impression. 

 
1. “George Romney,” line and stipple engraving after Romney’s self-portrait aged forty-nine (see enlargement). Collection of Robert N. Essick.

 The print (illus. 1) is on wove paper that has been trimmed inside the platemark.There is no watermark. For full bibliographical information, see Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2011,” Blake 45.4 (spring 2012): 141.  The image has been heavily worked using a variety of etching/engraving  techniques, including line and stipple. Below the image is the pencil  inscription “George Romney, the Portrait Painter Self-Portrait” in an  unknown but probably modern hand. The graphic syntax (the linear  patterns, dots, and flicks used to represent objects, textures, and  tonality) recalls engravings of the second half of the eighteenth  century, which suggests that it was executed no later than c. 1820.  Indeed, the physical, technical, and aesthetic properties of the print  are consistent with other eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century  reproductive engravings, including those by Blake. 
Significantly, the model for the  print—Romney’s unfinished self-portrait—was in Hayley’s possession until  it passed to Romney’s son, John, around 1820.John  Romney claims that Hayley “did not allow him [George Romney] to finish  it, but hurried it off to Eartham without delay” (John Romney, Memoirs of the Life and Works of George Romney [London: Baldwin and Cradock, 1830] 192). For John Romney’s acquisition of the painting, see note 9, below.  The only visual sources for this painting that were in public  circulation prior to 1820 were Blake’s portrait miniature of Romney that  Hayley had given to William Long (now untraced), an engraving by  William Ridley after Blake’s miniature, published as the frontispiece to  the April 1803 issue of the European Magazine, and London Review, and Watson’s frontispiece to Hayley’s Life of Romney, published in 1809.For  Blake’s miniature of Romney given to Long and Ridley’s engraving, see  Blake to Hayley, 16 March 1804 (E 744) and Crosby and Essick 62-63. Alex  Kidson suggests that the self-portrait was presented to John Romney by  Hayley “about 1820” (Kidson, George Romney 1734–1802 [London:  National Portrait Gallery Publications, 2002] 180). An undated stipple  engraving by Thomas Wright after Romney’s unfinished self-portrait is  the frontispiece for John Romney’s Memoirs. For a list of Romney’s self-portraits and engravings deriving from them, see Humphry Ward and W. Roberts, Romney: A Biographical and Critical Essay with a Catalogue Raisonné of His Works, vol. 2 (London: Agnew and Sons; New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1904) 134.  A number of crucial differences between the Ridley and Watson  engravings and the recently discovered print, particularly in the  delineation of the background, clothing, and character of Romney’s face,  discount them as sources.For  example, the anonymous print depicts a smile line extending vertically  from the left side of the mouth, consistent with the original painting.  The Ridley and Watson prints do not show this line. The lapel of  Romney’s coat also differs from Ridley’s and Watson’s prints. If  the print was produced in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth  century, as suggested by the graphic syntax, then whoever was  responsible for its execution had access to the original painting. Apart  from Watson, before 1820 only one engraver had direct access to, and  more importantly was commissioned to engrave, this painting. That  engraver was William Blake.
 
In Blake’s correspondence there are more references to a portrait  engraving of Romney than to any other reproductive engraving he  executed. The epistolary evidence indicates that he began the engraving  during the final months of his stay in Felpham and continued to work on  the plate until at least late 1804. In a letter  to John Flaxman of 7 August 1803, Hayley reveals that Blake had “made  two excellent drawings of Romney” after the unfinished self-portrait and  Thomas Alphonso Hayley’s medallion, and that he intends for both to be  “engraved for a single quarto volume of [Romney’s] Life.”G. E. Bentley, Jr., Blake Records, 2nd ed. (New Haven: Yale UP, 2004) [hereafter cited as BR(2)] 157. An  initial fee of thirty guineas was agreed for the engraving after the  self-portrait before Blake increased his fee to forty guineas.Hayley  relates his negotiations with Blake to Flaxman: “Blake surprised me a  little in saying (after we had settled the price of 30 Guineas for the  first [portrait engraving of Romney] the price which He had for the  Cowper) that Romneys head would require much Labor and he must have 40  for it—startled as I was I replied I will not stint you in behalf of  Romney” (BR[2] 157). Because of this rise and the amount  Blake had asked for engraving the medallion, Hayley did not finalize  the medallion commission. Shortly after he returned to London, Blake  wrote to Hayley, “I lose no moment to complete Romney to satisfaction”  (7 October 1803, E 736). Over the next few weeks he appears to have made  significant progress: “I go on finishing Romney with spirit” (26  October, E 738). In a letter of 13 December, he implies that the plate  was sufficiently finished for proofs to be taken: “Mr Romney[s] Portrait goes on with spirit. I do not send a proof because I cannot get one the Printers [being]  having been this afternoon unable or unwilling and my Press  not yet being put up” (E 739). On 16 March 1804, Blake sent Ridley’s  engraving of Romney to Hayley, describing it as “a copy from that  Miniature; you kindly sufferd me to make, from the Picture of Romney  which I am now Engraving” (E 744). By the  beginning of May, Blake had either assembled his own press or convinced  the previously unable/unwilling copperplate printer to pull a proof  impression of the plate, which was shown to one of Romney’s oldest  friends, Adam Walker:For Romney and Walker, see Paley, “William Blake, George Romney, and The Life of George Romney, Esq.” 54-55. I have seen the elder Mr. Walker. He knew and  admired without any preface my print of Romney, and when his daughter  came in he gave the print into her hand without a word, and she  immediately said, “Ah! Romney! younger than I have known him, but very like indeed.” (E 748) Despite these testimonials, Blake did not send a proof to Hayley for  another two months. On 22 June he offered an update on his progress,  citing his former business partner, James Parker, to emphasize the  quality of the engraving: “Head of Romney is in very great forwardness.  Parker commends it highly. Flaxman has not yet seen it. but shall soon,  and then you shall have a Proof of it for your remarks also” (E 753).  Flaxman may have seen the print shortly afterward, for on 16 July Blake  sent a proof, “still [in] an unfinishd state” (E 753), to Hayley.
 
Part of Blake’s dilatoriness may be explained by other projects he  was then working on for Hayley, such as the two plates for the third  volume of The Life of Cowper (1803–04), as well as other commercial work, including the frontispiece to Prince Hoare’s Academic Correspondence (1804).Blake  appears to have prioritized the two Cowper plates over the Romney  portrait engraving, probably beginning work on them at the beginning of  1804; on 23 February, he informed Hayley that the Cowper plates “are  both in great forwardness” (E 742). They were published on 25 March. In a  letter to Hoare of 25 December 1803 (BR[2] 174-75), Flaxman recommended Blake for the Academic Correspondence engraving, which was evidently finished by the beginning of February 1804, for a review of the pamphlet in the Literary Journal opines that “the Royal Academy of England might have offered an engraving worthy of the subject, and of the country” (BR[2] 190). For the Cowper and Hoare plates, see Robert N. Essick, William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1991) 89-91.  In addition, Blake was acting as Hayley’s representative in London,  locating, inspecting, and, with Flaxman’s help, compiling a list of  paintings to be engraved as illustrations for the biography of Romney.  During this period, he also began relief-etching his two epic poems, Milton and Jerusalem, according to the 1804 dates on their title pages.
 
Almost a month before Blake sent a proof, Hayley had solicited Flaxman’s advice on hiring other engravers to work on the prospective illustrations for the biography.In a letter to Flaxman of 18 June 1804, Hayley seeks advice on employing “your Freand Cromak” (BR[2] 196). Flaxman had earlier advised against employing Watson for book illustrations (see BR[2] 194). By August, Blake was aware that Hayley was considering Watson, whose delicate stippling style appealed to fashionable tastes, to engrave Thomas Alphonso’s medallion of Romney.On  23 February 1804, Blake relates Daniel Braithwaite’s “wish that you  [Hayley] would give the Public an Engraving of that Medallion by your  Sons matchless hand” (E 742). He may have been attempting to revive the  medallion commission, which had been left unresolved in August 1803  owing to his increase in fees (see note 12, above). On 7 August, Blake approves of Watson, stating that “Miss. W. would Engrave your Sons Medallion of Romney most delicately.”For a full transcription of this letter, see Crosby and Essick 53-54. While Hayley’s decision to commission Watson may have been informed by the criticisms that Blake’s engravings for The Life of Cowper and his six plates for The Triumphs of Temper  had received from Lady Hesketh and her circle (Hesketh favored the  softer aesthetic associated with Watson’s style of stippling), there were also practical reasons for his employing other engravers on the Romney biography.For a discussion of contemporary criticisms of Blake’s plates for The Triumphs of Temper, see Crosby, “‘a Ladys Book’: Blake’s Engravings for Hayley’s The Triumphs of Temper,” Blake in Our Time: Essays in Honour of G. E. Bentley Jr., ed. Karen Mulhallen (Toronto: U of Toronto P, 2010) 105-30 (especially 112). See also note 40, below.  During 1804 Hayley, Flaxman, and Blake discussed the logistics of  selecting paintings for reproduction and also the style that would best  replicate Romney’s aesthetic. For example, on 2 January Flaxman suggests  to Hayley that Romney’s chalk drawings “are all well worth etching in a  bold manner which I think Blake is likely to do with great success” (BR[2]  177). In a letter to Hayley of 4 May, Blake proposes altering his  linear style for the Romney commissions: “Mr. Flaxman agrees with me  that somewhat more than outline is necessary to the execution of  Romney’s designs, because his merit is eminent in the art of massing his  lights and shades” (E 749). He goes on to say that he can etch the designs in a stipple manner similar to his 1797 portrait engraving of Leonard Euler.Blake’s engraving is the frontispiece to vol. 1 of Euler’s Elements of Algebra (1797). See Essick, Commercial Book Illustrations 75.  Because of Hayley’s initial deadline of November 1804, however, more  engravers were needed to complete the illustrations. In his letter to  Hayley of 22 June, Blake cites Parker to suggest that even “Eight  different Engravers” (E 752) would not be able to execute by November  the eight designs listed. He revisits this point in his letter of 7  August: “It is certainly necessary that the best Artists that can be  engaged should be Employd in the Work of Romneys Life.” At the beginning of the next paragraph, he describes working on the plates of the Shipwreck and “Romneys Head” with “Spirit and neatness.”See Crosby and Essick 53.
 
Blake was still working on “the Head of Romney” at the end of  September, promising to send a second proof to Hayley: “You shall soon  see a Proof of Him in a very advancd state  I have not yet  proved it but shall soon when I will send you one” (28 September 1804, E  755). The following month, he claims that he will send proofs of “the Head of R and the Shipwreck,  which you shall soon see in a much more perfect state” (23 October, E  756). Later in the same letter, Blake describes a transformative visit  to the Truchsessian Gallery before connecting this experience to “the  plates I am now engraving after Romney”: Dear Sir, excuse my enthusiasm or rather madness,  for I am really drunk with intellectual vision whenever I take a pencil  or graver into my hand, even as I used to be in my youth, and as I have  not been for twenty dark, but very profitable years. I thank God that I  courageously pursued my course through darkness. In a short time I shall  make my assertion good that I am become suddenly as I was at first, by  producing the Head of Romney and the Shipwreck quite another thing from what you or I ever expected them to be. (E 757)For Blake’s experiences at the gallery, see Paley, “The Truchsessian Gallery Revisited,” Studies in Romanticism 16.2 (spring 1977): 165-77. In a letter to Hayley of 4 December, he once more claims that the two  Romney plates exemplify the recuperated artistic vision of his youth:  “Hope in a few days to send Proofs of Plates which I must say are far  beyond Any thing I have ever done. … I have lost my Confusion of Thought  while at work and am as much myself when I take the Pencil or Graver  into my hand as I used to be in my Youth” (E 758).
 
Blake finally sent a second proof of his portrait engraving on 18  December. It appears either that he harbored some concerns about his  patron’s reaction or that Hayley replied in an untraced letter shortly  afterward, for on 28 December Blake offers the following assurances: “I  am very far from shewing the Portrait of Romney as a finishd Proof. be  assured that with our Good Flaxmans good help and with your remarks on  it in addition I hope to make it a Supernaculum” (E 760). He uses the mock Latinate superlative “supernaculum” to anticipate the high quality of his finished print.“Supernaculum” derives from the German phrase “auf den Nagel” (on to the nail) to describe liquor drunk to the last drop. The OED cites Blake’s letter to Hayley for the use of supernaculum to mean an excellent example of its kind.  In a postscript, he reiterates his claim that the engraving required  more work: “I made a very high finishd Drawing of Romney as a  Companion to my drawing of the head of Cowper (you remember)  with which Flaxman is very much satisfied and says that when my Print  is like that I need wish it no better. and I am determind to make it  so at least” (E 760). Hayley apparently responded positively to the  print, or at least to Blake’s commitment to producing a “supernaculum,”  because on 19 January 1805 Blake states: “I feel extremely happy that  you think My Prints will do me Credit” (E 762). This is the final reference in the extant correspondence to his engraving Romney’s unfinished self-portrait.In  the penultimate sentence of the letter, Blake refers to the projected  engravings of Romney’s paintings: “I feel it is necessary to be very  circumspect how we advance with Romney his best Works only, ought to be  engraved for your Work” (E 762). On 11 December 1805, he mentions that  the plate of the shipwreck requires work: “A very few touches will  finish the Shipwreck Those few I have added upon a Proof before I parted  with the Picture. It is a Print that I feel proud of on a New  inspection” (E 767).
 
The epistolary evidence indicates that Blake worked on this portrait  engraving between 7 August 1803 and at least 28 December 1804. He sent  two proof impressions to Hayley: the first on 16 July 1804 and the  second on 18 December. The second one was sent after he knew that Hayley  had Watson in mind to work on at least one illustration for the Romney  biography, and also after his transformative experience at the  Truchsessian Gallery.
 
The evidence also suggests that the engraving was intended to be the frontispiece for the biography. In  his letter to Flaxman of 7 August 1803, Hayley compares Blake’s  portrait engraving of Romney to the frontispiece for the first volume of  The Life of Cowper when discussing prices.See note 12,  above. In addition, Blake’s comparison of his “very high finishd  Drawing of Romney”  (E 760) to the drawing of Cowper after  Romney (the intermediary model for the Cowper frontispiece) in his  letter of 28 December 1804 suggests that the engraving of Romney was  intended to be the frontispiece. Furthermore, the intended placement is supported by several inconsistencies in Hayley’s biography of Romney. In  1806 Hayley invited Watson to Felpham to make preparatory drawings of  the Romney paintings he owned, including three self-portraits.Hayley, Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Hayley, Esq., ed. John Johnson, vol. 2 (London: Henry Colburn, 1823) 59. She engraved them on a single plate for the frontispiece to The Life of Romney.For a discussion of this frontispiece, see Crosby and Essick 60, 63-64, and Paley, “William Blake, George Romney, and The Life of George Romney, Esq.” 60. According to Hayley’s preface, “the Introduction and a considerable part of [the biography], were written in the year 1803.”Hayley, The Life of George Romney, Esq. (Chichester: T. Payne, 1809) n. pag. In his Memoirs, Hayley claims that he began the biography “about the middle of December, 1803” (2: 45). He did not, however, fully correct his text by the time the work was published to take account of Watson’s tripartite frontispiece.According to his Memoirs, Hayley was “retouching the Life of Romney” and revising proofs during the first half of 1808 (2: 66). The directions to the binder, for example, describe the frontispiece as “Portrait of Romney at the age of forty-nine.”Hayley, The Life of George Romney, Esq. [421]. He also refers in the main text to a single image: “The  portrait, that forms a frontispiece to this volume, represents him as  he appeared in the most active season of his existence.”Hayley, The Life of George Romney, Esq. 254.  In both instances, Hayley appears to be referring to Blake’s engraving,  which was commissioned during the period that the majority of the  biography was composed, rather than Watson’s frontispiece. We know that  he initially negotiated a price of thirty guineas for Blake’s  engraving—the same amount Blake received for the Cowper  frontispiece—suggesting a similar size and amount of work for each  plate. The image size of the Cowper frontispiece is 185 x 144 mm. The  image size of the recently discovered print is 184 x 145 mm. The almost  identical dimensions indicate a correspondence in format. Was the  anonymous engraving designed to be the frontispiece for a quarto-sized  volume on George Romney? To help answer this question, we must turn our  attention to its aesthetic qualities.
 
There are significant challenges in attributing unsigned reproductive  engravings to specific engravers. For booksellers and printsellers,  accuracy of replication and uniformity of product were paramount. Professional  copy engravers, such as Blake, possessed a standard armory of graphic  syntax that facilitated the accurate reproduction of original images on  copper, which were then printed as uniform objects: book illustrations  and/or separate prints.For a detailed discussion, see Essick, William Blake Printmaker (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1980) 25-28.  The emphasis on pictorial fidelity via a standardized graphic  vocabulary drastically restricts individual artistic expression, making  it extremely difficult to identify the authors of unsigned reproductive  engravings based on graphic syntax alone. Indeed, it would be very  difficult to identify Blake as the engraver of a number of his  commercial reproductive engravings without a sculpsit inscription. For  example, his portrait engravings of David Hartley (1791), Earl Spencer  (1813), and Robert Hawker (1820) are highly conventional, executed with  the standard linear patterns common to all copy engravers of the period.Another  example is Blake’s “Beggar’s Opera” plate (1790), which Essick  describes as “untouched by Blake’s own personal imagery or graphic  techniques” (Printmaker 59). Without Blake’s signature on these prints, attribution would rely on circumstantial evidence, as is the case for his apprenticeship engravings.According  to Benjamin Heath Malkin, Blake engraved “from those drawings” he made  in Westminster Abbey during his apprenticeship (BR[2] 563).  These engravings, all signed by Blake’s master, James Basire, as was the  conventional practice, include portraits of numerous English kings and  queens. See also Essick, Commercial Book Illustrations 115-20. With this caveat in mind, there are visual clues in the recently discovered print that can help in identifying its author.
 
Unlike the Ridley and Watson engravings, which are pure stipple, the  anonymous engraving evinces an unusual combination of the standard  graphic syntax associated with reproductive engraving. The  background is rendered with dense lines interspersed with heavy  stippling, probably made with a mattoir, or mace-headed tool.For Blake’s use of a mattoir in his commercial engravings, see Essick, Printmaker 56.  Similarly, Romney’s coat is delineated with a bold mix of roulette (a  fine-toothed wheel used to make dotted patterns) and mattoir work and  combinations of heavy lines to achieve a rough texture. Certain areas of  the coat, such as above the right arm and both lapels, are exceedingly  dense. Under magnification, the interstices between the lines merge,  dissolving the graphic syntax into rugged blocks. A combination of fine  stipple and line is used to depict the hair, while sparse stippling  provides form and texture to the necktie. The face is rendered with  exceptionally delicate stippling, and demonstrates a sophisticated  treatment of light and shadow on the forehead, nose, and around the  mouth. This deployment of graphic techniques is  striking, providing a particularly strong contrast between the soft face  and the rougher clothing and background that is very different from the  other engravings after Romney’s self-portrait.Blake  uses a similar combination of delicate stippling to render facial  features and dense linear strokes for clothing in his extant miniature  portraits. See Crosby, “A Minute Skirmish: Blake, Hayley and the Art of  Miniature Painting,” Blake and Conflict, ed. Sarah Haggarty and Jon Mee (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009) 164-84.
 
The techniques discernible in the print were all within Blake’s range of graphic styles. For  example, he uses comparable combinations of line and fine stipple to  delineate hair in his portrait engraving of Edmund Pitts (c. 1793-96)  (illus. 2).For the Pitts engraving, see Essick, The Separate Plates of William Blake (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1983) 178-80. 

 
2. Detail of Blake’s line and stipple engraving of Edmund Pitts  compared with detail of the anonymous line and stipple engraving of  Romney. The Pitts print is from an extra-illustrated copy of Daniel Lysons, Historical Account of the Environs of London  (1796), RB 272584 vol. 10, reproduced by permission of the Huntington  Library, San Marino, California. The Romney print is from the collection  of Robert N. Essick.

  In addition, as with the depiction of Romney’s coat in the anonymous  print, Blake uses extensive roulette and mattoir work to give a rough  texture to Pitts’s coat that is juxtaposed to the subtle stippling on  the face. The width of the roulette lines in the recently discovered  print, approximately 0.9 mm., corresponds to the Pitts portrait. When we  examine Blake’s early commercial engravings for roulette work, we find  the same width of lines in, for example, the roundel borders of “Robin  Hood and Clorinda” (1783), “Calisto” (1784), and “Zephyrus and Flora”  (1784). These early commercial works also exhibit a notable contrast between bold patterns of lines and dots and delicate stippling.For a discussion of these early commercial engravings, see Essick, Printmaker 55-57.  In “Morning Amusement” and “Evening Amusement” (both 1782) after  Watteau, Blake deploys extremely dense linear patterns, with roulette  and mattoir work in the foreground, while the facial features of the  main group of figures, though showing less proficiency in the treatment  of light and shadow than the anonymous portrait engraving, are rendered with fine stippling.For  another example of extremely fine stippling, see “Venus Dissuades  Adonis from Hunting” (1787). In this print, Blake uses coarse stippling  on background foliage and delicate stippling on the central figures. See  also Essick, Separate Plates 145-49. Another such  contrast is evident in “The Idle Laundress” (1788), where dense linear  patterns with heavy roulette and mattoir work on the boy’s coat  represent a rough texture that is juxtaposed to the stipple shading on  the face. 
The technical and stylistic correspondences between the graphic  syntax in the anonymous engraving and Blake’s early commercial prints  prompt us to recall his claim in October 1804 that his experiences at  the Truchsessian Gallery had inspired him to return to his aesthetic of  twenty years earlier. Blake’s rhetoric in his  letter of 23 October may seem hyperbolic, but for much of 1804 he was  attempting to secure engraving commissions from Hayley.See Crosby and Essick, especially 68-72. No doubt recalling Hesketh’s criticism of his Cowper frontispiece (she believed that it hinted at her cousin’s insanity) and The Triumphs of Temper plates, Blake repeatedly informs Hayley that he is capable of altering his linear style to better represent Romney’s designs.Hesketh requested that Hayley not include an engraving of Romney’s portrait of Cowper in The Life of Cowper (BR[2] 105). In his letter to Flaxman of 7 August 1803, Hayley refers to Blake’s plates for The Triumphs of Temper,  “I am sorry to say that the Ladies (and it is a Ladys Book) find  Fault with the Engravings,” before revealing that “the Engravings of  Cowper have also been heavily censur’d” (BR[2] 157). See note 18, above, and Paley, “Cowper as Blake’s Spectre,” Eighteenth-Century Studies 1 (1968): 236-52. In the letter of 4 May 1804, for example, he begins by claiming that he is developing a more fashionable aesthetic: “I  thank you sincerely for Falconer, an admirable poet, and the admirable  prints to it by Fittler. Whether you intended it or not, they have given  me some excellent hints in engraving; his manner of working is what I  shall endeavour to adopt in many points” (E 748).Blake may have been referring to James Fittler’s engraving of a shipwreck in Falconer’s poem. See Essick, Printmaker 173.  By 7 August, he knew that Hayley was considering Watson to engrave  Thomas Alphonso’s medallion. As we have seen, Hayley initially offered  this commission to Blake the previous year. It is  possible that, despite approving of Watson in his letter of 7 August,  Blake may have felt threatened, particularly as her delicate stippling  style was popular with Hayley’s circle.For a  discussion of Watson in the context of Blake’s configuration of “Female  Will,” see Essick, “William Blake’s ‘Female Will’ and Its Biographical  Context,” Studies in English Literature 1500–1900 31 (1991): 615-30.  The similarly delicate and skillful stippling evident in the recently  discovered print certainly evokes Watson, although the clothing and  background are very different from her work.
 
There are a number of idiosyncrasies in the characterization of Romney that are suggestive of Blake’s hand. Unlike the Ridley and Watson engravings, the print depicts him with a symmetrically bowed mouth.In both Watson’s and Ridley’s engravings, Romney has a slightly asymmetrical bowed mouth. The same visual trope can be seen in many of Blake’s paintings, including Adam Naming the Beasts, Eve Naming the Birds, and Christ Blessing.Martin Butlin, The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake, 2 vols. (New Haven: Yale UP, 1981) #667-68, 670, all datable to c. 1810.  In the print, there are lines extending vertically from the left corner  of the mouth, which, combined with the bowed mouth, hint at a playful  smile that is absent from Ridley and Watson. Another distinctive feature  is the enlarged and slightly protruding eyes. These  differ significantly from the Ridley and Watson plates, but are similar  to the prominent eyes in Blake’s own self-portrait of c. 1802.See Essick, “A (Self?) Portrait of William Blake,” Blake 39.3 (winter 2005–06): 126-39.  Rather than the introspective, melancholic subject of the original  painting and the Ridley and Watson engravings, the recently discovered  engraving presents an artist who, if not “drunk with intellectual  vision” (E 757), certainly possesses an outward-looking character.
 
If this print is by Blake, the slightly bulging eyes and bowed mouth may explain why Hayley rejected it. The  expressive character departs not only from Romney’s original, but also  from the tone of Hayley’s biography, which portrays Romney as  melancholic.In his Life of Romney,  Hayley follows the same autobiographical metanarrative that he  establishes in the biography of Cowper, casting himself as curative for  Romney’s increasingly frequent bouts of depression. See, for  example, Life of Romney 255. John Romney addresses this characterization of his father in Memoirs of the Life and Works of George Romney:  “Mr. Romney was naturally of a placid and easy disposition, and it was  only in the decline of life, when his health was impaired by  application, and his feelings ruffled by peculiar circumstances, that he  manifested that morbidness of feeling, which Mr. Hayley has been so  particular in noticing” (246). Hayley may have found the engraving excessive in its depiction of the artist as genius, a personality seized with excited imagination rather than inward reflection.For Hayley’s decision to choose Watson’s frontispiece over Blake’s, see also Paley, “William Blake, George Romney, and The Life of George Romney, Esq.” 58-59.
 
Without a sculpsit inscription, a definitive attribution of  the recently discovered print is not possible, but it is certainly not  improbable that the engraving is by Blake. To summarize the evidence:  the graphic style used to delineate the print, and particularly the  rather old-fashioned treatments of the clothing and background, provide a  terminus ante quem of no later than c. 1820. Prior to 1820,  the model for the print was available only via the following sources:  Romney’s original painting, which was in Hayley’s possession, Blake’s  miniature, which was in Long’s possession, and Ridley’s and Watson’s  engravings. There are significant compositional and stylistic  differences between the print and the Ridley and Watson engravings.  These differences enable us to eliminate them as engravers and their  respective engravings as models. Therefore, whoever executed the  portrait engraving must have had access to the original self-portrait.
 
The correspondence shows that Blake worked on a quarto-sized portrait  engraving of Romney after his own drawing of the painter’s  self-portrait for at least sixteen months and sent Hayley two proof  impressions. The recently discovered print is before all letters,  indicating that it is a proof impression. The image size is within 1 mm. of Blake’s frontispiece for the first volume of Hayley’s quarto edition of The Life of Cowper.Watson engraved the frontispiece for the octavo edition of Hayley’s Life of Cowper  (1806). Hayley consulted Blake, because in a letter of March 1805 Blake  states that “the Idea of Seeing an Engraving of Cowper by the hand of  Caroline Watson is I assure you a pleasing one to me” (E 764). At the  time, Blake was negotiating with the publisher Richard Phillips about an  octavo edition of Hayley’s animal ballads, illustrated with new  engravings. The prospect of producing engravings after his own designs  rather than a reduced version of a copy engraving that had already  attracted significant criticism may have influenced Blake’s generous  reaction to Watson’s gaining the Cowper commission. Until 1806, Blake’s engraving of Romney was intended to be the frontispiece for The Life of Romney, a quarto book.
 
The graphic syntax of the print is within the range of Blake’s  techniques, including both the bold linear, roulette, and mattoir work  on the clothing and the delicate stippling on the facial features. We  know that during 1804 Blake repeatedly offered to adapt his linear style  to include stippling and provided an example—his portrait of Euler—for  how he could execute the Romney plates. By 7 August, he was also aware  that Hayley was considering Watson—one of the most fashionable stipple  engravers of the period—for the Romney biography, suggesting that if the  print is by Blake, it is almost certainly not the proof state sent in  July 1804, but either the later state sent to Hayley in December or an  even more finished state executed in 1805. Finally, after his visit to  the Truchsessian Gallery in October 1804, Blake informed Hayley that he  had reclaimed the “intellectual vision” of his youth, which he had not  experienced “for twenty dark, but very profitable years,” and stated: “I  shall make my assertion good that I am become suddenly as I was at  first, by producing the Head of Romney … quite another thing  from what you or I ever expected [it] to be” (E 757). The recently  discovered print exhibits the same combination of rough linear patterns,  with roulette and mattoir work, contrasted with fine stippling  conspicuous in the commercial engravings that Blake produced  approximately twenty years before his visit to the gallery.
 
Considered together, both circumstantial and graphic evidence make it  probable that the recently discovered print is a proof impression  before all letters of Blake’s portrait engraving of Romney—a plate that  was, in Blake’s own words, “quite another thing from what” both patron  and craftsman expected. Unfortunately for Blake, Hayley appears to have  had different expectations, as well as a different conception of  “supernaculum.”

Blake. Wordsworth. Religion. is the third title in the New Directions in Religion and Literature series, published by Continuum Books. The earlier titles, The New Atheist Novel and Do the Gods Wear Capes?, give some sense of what these new directions might be. So it was comforting to see a stodgy title like Blake. Wordsworth. Religion., even though the scant 100 pages of the book seem undersized for its subject.
 
In fact, Jonathan Roberts has no intention of being comprehensive.  Rather, he focuses on Blake’s verse letter to Thomas Butts, “To my  Friend Butts I write,” and on the Solitary’s vision of the heavenly  Jerusalem in book 2 of Wordsworth’s The Excursion, and uses  them to demonstrate how poetry offers “a different type of engagement  with religion: one that can enrich rather than narrow understanding,  include rather than exclude, and creatively interrelate—rather than  destructively set at odds—different approaches to religion” (1). In his  introduction, Roberts describes his approach in some detail, calling it  experimental and “unusual”: Chapter by chapter I present a range of different  interpretive perspectives, many of which conflict with one another, and I  do so without attempting to reconcile them systematically. … The  conflict is not an analytical inadequacy that must be mastered ….  Rather, the insoluble diversity of critical approaches to these writers  is a mark of their poetry’s rich internal dialogue and hermeneutical  plenitude. (3) Some of these “perspectives” “are recognizably academic,” he asserts, but others are not: I have also included non-scholarly voices, even  when this inclusiveness means that some sections … are distinctly   “unacademic”. My hope is that the different methodologies … will bring  this diversity into focus without using any one approach to trump the  others …. For this reason, I attempt to identify with each of these  positions, but not exclusively with any single one of them. (3-4) So, according to the introduction, we are to expect a book that mixes  the scholarly with the non-academic, one that does not develop a  traditional argument, but instead explores the two poems from a variety  of angles, without privileging any of them. And the aim is not so much  to say something new about Blake or Wordsworth; rather, it is to use  their poems as a way of exploring the nature of religious experience.
 
The subsequent chapters make it even clearer that this is not a  scholarly book, in spite of Roberts’s occasional protestations to the  contrary. Chapter 2, for instance, consists mainly of the texts of the  Blake and Wordsworth passages he will discuss, prefaced by introductions  of the sort one might find in an undergraduate anthology. Thus, in a  book of about 100 pages of critical matter, fifteen percent of the text  is devoted to introducing and supplying texts. When he proceeds to  discuss them, he does so as promised, in a variety of ways. But is this,  as Roberts insists, a “hermeneutical plenitude,” or is it something  else? Chapter 4, for instance, “Autobiography,” purports to give an  autobiographical account of a mescaline trip that happened somewhere  between Windermere and Hawkshead—perhaps across the street from Beatrix  Potter’s home in Near Sawrey. Roberts writes: Ever since that experience … I have had a new,  continuing visual appreciation of all art forms, an appreciation which I  did not have before. Moreover, I have realized that quite literally  everything is Self, everything in the whole field of experience …. Since  this realization, the mystical strand of Blake’s and Wordsworth’s  poetry has a far clearer meaning to me than before. (46) This realization leads Roberts to take up the relationship of “Mysticism  and Psychedelics” (the title of chapter 5), including a catalogue of  famous writers and their experiments with mind-altering drugs, and we  learn, eventually, that the earlier account of his mescaline trip was in  fact a pastiche of Huxley, Ginsberg, Traherne, and one Christopher  Mayhew, MP, and may not have been autobiographical at all (or maybe it  was?). Then, having extolled the ways in which psychedelic drugs lead to  mystical insight, Roberts abruptly changes tune in chapter 6  (“Theology”), asserting that, of course, drugs are bad: they “cause and  sustain wars, lead to violence,” and so on—as if these were things his  readers didn’t know. And here he leaves the texts of Blake and  Wordsworth almost entirely out of the discussion, except to argue that  the two weren’t really mystics anyway (at least according to R. C.  Zaehner, and contra Evelyn Underhill, whom he cites extensively in  chapter 5).
 
Ultimately, this kind of bait and switch is tiresome. Roberts wants  to have everything as many ways as possible, teasing the reader, without  engaging himself seriously with his announced subject. Which leads one  to ask why the book was published at all, especially at such a  prohibitively high price. I can imagine it as a pamphlet or chapbook,  gracing the counter of a San Francisco bookshop in the late 60s, and  read by a handful of locals on their way to the next Doors concert. But  at $90 for the hardcover, about a dollar per page of critical prose,  Continuum Books isn’t selling to that market: they are aiming at  academic libraries and acquisitions librarians who see only a title. To  my mind, this is deeply problematic. At least, advise your libraries not  to order this book automatically, so that we do not become complicit in  publishing ventures of this sort.

In Blake, Deleuzian Aesthetics, and the Digital,  Claire Colebrook pursues the dual theoretical aims of exploring Blakean  textual operations through Deleuzean aesthetics and of grounding  Blake’s aesthetic commitments within the philosophical concepts  associated with Gilles Deleuze. The result of this double procedure,  while perhaps not pleasing to all Blake scholars, nonetheless discloses  the continuing ability of the illuminated canon and its mythopoeic  construction to absorb the most sophisticated critical modes without  exhausting Blake’s evolving vision of subjectivity. In this sense,  Colebrook’s well-written and energetic assessment joins a long tradition  of theoretical discussions that find in the composite textual states in  which Blake works connections to contemporary modes of analysis. As she  states in her conclusion, “Two centuries of Blake criticism have  followed from the working through of those moments in his poetry that  are resistant to synthesis[,] with criticism having to repeat, master,  narrativize, and trace the geneses of the inassimilable” (136). This  historical reading of Blake criticism, as the preface to the work makes  clear, emerges from the nature of Blake’s modes of production, where  “there is both the art of marking, tracing, sculpting, and binding (or  experience’s world of repeated, already-known and fully actualized  matters) and the destruction of any system with an influx of pure powers  (or the openness of innocence)” (xxv).
 
The digital evoked in the title relates to Blake’s textual states in  at least two senses: the fate of the individuated process of textual  production well known to Blake studies (where the hand and its digits  enact the haptic as creative process) and the codification of this  hapticity into digital modes of reproduction (which translates the  unique analogical dimensions of any given work into a system for  consumption). Blakean aesthetics, like that pursued by Deleuze, is  positioned on this ontological fault line, and the Blakean text thereby  “will rehearse … the inherent impossibility and destructiveness of  digitalism, alongside digitalism’s persistent necessity” (xxxv).  Certainly, one of the strengths of this book is its dedication to remain  poised at this juncture, and another is its willingness to resist  enacting a purely mechanical juxtaposition of Blake and Deleuze, which  can be discerned in its swerve away from Deleuze into other forms of  criticism (e.g., that practiced by Jerome McGann) in the later chapters.  Through such a procedure, “tensions or seeming contradictions in  Blake’s work” (xiv) become the center of concern for the emergence of a  “transcendental empiricism” (142) that clearly anticipates Deleuze’s  notion of a “pure immanence” in the work of the same title.
 
Colebrook’s attention to Blake’s mode of production begins with a  recognition that much of his work explores the operations of “a  destructive imagination” necessary to resist creative work simply  inscribing “the same dull round of systemic repetition” while  articulating an “individualized” textuality that resists a fall into  “undifferentiated chaos” (2). What emerges, in her estimation, is a  highly complex form of dynamic contraries beyond the binaries at work in  Blake’s early canon (e.g., innocence and experience or reason and  energy) “composed of a multiplicity of voices and transformations of  single voices from redemptive vision to totalizing despair” that are  both “diagnostic” yet “disturbingly undecidable” (6). Blake’s work  achieves “the creation of an analog language” posited by Deleuze (in  relation to the painter Francis Bacon) capable of resisting any easy  translation into “systems that are not one’s own” (17, 21), which  identifies it as a participant in “a counter-enlightenment tradition”  (38) extending through Nietzsche to Deleuze.
 
The tracks of this tradition point toward an emphasis on the type of  incarnation related to both the theme of Blake’s larger works and his  evolving method of textual production, which unveil the tensions between  bodies expressive of “an actual and richer difference” and the genesis  of “bodies that cover over the fluxes of force” (45). As Colebrook  argues, “This ambivalence regarding the status of the body and its  matter is the very motor of Blake’s poetry and visual work” by exploring  textually and exploring thematically “a productive undecidabilty [sic] whereby form is content”  (47). This ambivalence is encoded in Blake’s work upon numerous planes  of expression, whether in the aesthetics of the hand and the eye, the  interplay between the body and the spirit, or the politics of history  and the psyche, with Colebrook’s analysis consistently connecting these  tensions to a wide range of Blake’s early and late prophetic poems. Some  critics might argue that this perspective, to borrow Blake’s phrase  about Swedenborg from The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, is thus  only “a recapitulation of all superficial opinions” (E 43) filtered  through Deleuzean aesthetics, yet I would argue that such an assessment  is flawed. The analysis breaks open new critical spaces within which to  probe Blake’s continuing, and indeed constantly evolving, relevance in a  world increasingly dedicated to the digital and the erasure of the  analogical precisely by connecting Deleuzean method to that of McGann’s  theory of “texts as acts” (65) and Alain Badiou’s related view of text  as event (67). Read in relation to both McGann and Badiou, the poem  generally and Blake’s poetry in particular are “essentially open” (85).
 
Given the return of the psychoanalytic in romantic criticism,  primarily through the work of Joel Faflak, the degree to which Blake  composed “a symptomatology of the modes of life” (88) has achieved a new  context and adds an intensified context for Colebrook’s analysis. The  inward politics of the psyche and the outward politics of physical  conflict, connected so intensely in the late illuminated prophecies,  provide a vehicle to create in the poetic body “a performative  contradiction” (92), which in Colebrook’s well-chosen phrase is not only  “the very condition of poetry, [but] which is also the condition of  life” (95). Such a view lends to Blake’s work a “counter-vitalist  imperative” much needed in “the twenty-first century” (97). This  emphasis on “life” assumes priority in the closing chapters of  Colebrook’s book, which address Blake’s “[double-edged] attacks on  modernity” (99) and become the primary means to assess the poet’s use of  this counter-vitalist aesthetics as a corrective antidote to “the  challenge of madness” (103) always lurking on the margins of  the last prophetic works. The deployment of Deleuze, then, is also  corrective of traditional forms of psychoanalytic criticism as applied  to Blake’s work, since the often depressive pessimistic analytic modes  of Freud and Lacan are supplemented by recent neuroscientific work to  shift analysis toward “the true nature of life as affective, rather than  cognitive” (113). This places in a better context the Blakean  commitment to self-annihilation, a shift from “self-maintenance” toward  “self-overcoming” (115), which opens onto the thoroughly Blakean view  that “stresses that actual human being and all natural life are already  eternal and infinite” (120).
 
As my review suggests, there is much to admire in Colebrook’s  creative collision of Blakean and Deleuzean aesthetics, yet her analysis  could also be considered somewhat problematic for the last generation  of Blake scholars. Judging from the critical work put into play  throughout the book, it would be easy to assume that this type of  engagement is completely new, yet that would be an error in judgment and  in research, since a number of Blake scholars, including myself, have  sought to position the assessment of Blake upon this same theoretical  ground. While the range of theoretical voices allows “the analog  differences of variation to become audible within the digital system of  phonemes” (139), Colebrook’s inattention to other, more recent critical  analyses has ignored or overlooked precisely the same type of analysis  in Blake criticism itself. One obvious location is Romantic Circles http://​www.​rc.​umd.​edu, which has a special issue dedicated to Romanticism and the New Deleuze  (January 2008), and a number of other recent secondary studies have  explored Blake’s work through analogous analytic frames of reference.  With that said, Colebrook’s work is written with energy and insight and  creates an enriched critical environment to judge anew Blake’s  aesthetics and to account for the curious ability of Blakean modes of  textuality to absorb almost any theoretical apparatus without  exhaustion.

To my list of catalogue references to Blake’s Night Thoughts, which was augmented by G. E. Bentley, Jr.,Wayne C. Ripley, “Printed References to and Known Prices of Blake’s Night Thoughts, 1796–1826,” Blake 43.2 (fall 2009): 72-75; G. E. Bentley, Jr., “Sales and collection records, 1798–1840,” in “William Blake and His Circle: A Checklist of Publications and Discoveries in 2010,” Blake 45.1 (summer 2011): 18-19.  should be added eight new listings. Perhaps the most important is the  February 1800 auction catalogue for the library of George Galwey  Mills: A Catalogue of a Large, Extensive, and Valuable Parcel  of Books, in Every Science, and in Most Languages; Being the Genuine  Library of George Galwey Mills, Esq. (Gone to the West Indies) … Which  Will Be Sold by Auction, by Mr. Jeffery, at No. 11 Pall-Mall, on Monday,  the 24th of February, 1800, and the Twelve Following Days, (Sundays  Excepted.).The text is available via ECCO. The other listings are found in Google Books. Mills is best known as the owner of the Sherborne Missal,Janet Backhouse, The Sherborne Missal (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999) 56-57. which was sold at the 1800 auction for £215. The goal of the auction seems to have been quick cash for Mills’s move to his family’s plantation on St. Christopher.For Mills’s financial situation, see Backhouse 60. Night Thoughts is lot 457: “Young’s Night Thoughts, finely printed, folio 1797,” and the handwritten note in the margin records that it was purchased for 10s. (30).The following item, Granger’s Biographical History of England, is also numbered 457.
 
What is noteworthy in the description of the book is the fact that  Blake’s illustrations are not mentioned. Blake’s edition was the only  folio of Night Thoughts published (and certainly the only one  in 1797). In addition, the book is classified under the category  “Miscellaneous, Including the English Classics” and not under “Natural  History, and Books of Prints,” which includes other well-illustrated  books, most of which are folios. Moreover, because Mills was desperate  for cash, the presence of any plates and other potentially lucrative  bibliographic details are carefully noted in both categories. It is  possible, therefore, that the catalogue describes the unillustrated  state of Night Thoughts, first noticed by Bentley in 1980.Bentley, “Young’s Night Thoughts (London: R. Edwards, 1797): A New Unillustrated State,” Blake 14.1 (summer 1980): 34-35.  Whether or not this is the case, Mills did know at least one of the  Edwardses, and his bookplate is found in a copy of Junius’s Stat nominis umbra, 2 vols. (London: T. Bensley, 1796-97), with the inscription “1796 B[ough]t. of Edwards.”Bloomsbury Auctions: http://​www.​bloomsburyauctions.​com/​cms/​pages/​lot/​352/​263. As Bentley notes, the initials “J / E”, James Edwards, appear on the inner front cover of the unillustrated Night Thoughts. As my discovery of the advertisements for volume 2 suggests, James may have been more involved in the production and distribution of the book than has been recognized.Ripley, “‘In Great Forwardness’?: 1798 Advertisements for Volume Two of William Blake’s Night Thoughts,” Notes and Queries 58.1 (2011): 57-59.  Unfortunately, if Mills did, in fact, own the unillustrated copy, the  sales catalogue explains neither why he did so nor why the copy was  created in the first place.
 
The second new listing occurs in A Catalogue of Books, for the Year 1807, … by Cuthell and Martin, Middle Row, Holborn (London: n.d.). It is lot 960: “Young’s Night Thoughts, beautifully printed, with engravings round the letter press, part I, all that was ever published,  15s — 1797” (39). What is painfully significant here is that Blake’s  name is not mentioned as either the designer or engraver, even as Robert  Cromek was publicly trying to puff up Blake’s status as a designer  while privately denigrating his engraving skills. The catalogue offers  many other editions of Night Thoughts, and the listing for an  1802 reprint of Thomas Stothard’s illustrations does mention his name.  Like the Mills listing, Cuthell and Martin’s listing emphasizes the  beauty of the printing. It also confirms that there were no more  volumes.
 
The third listing appears in A Catalogue of the Library of the Late Sir H [enry]. C [harles]. Englefield, Bart. … Which Will Be Sold by Auction, by Mr. Stanley ([London], 1833). The copy is lot 1135,  and it has a minimal description: “Young’s Night Thoughts, illustrated  by Blake” (52). The Catholic Englefield (1752–1822) belonged to many  scientific and artistic societies, including the Society of Antiquaries,  the Geological Society, and the Society of Dilettanti. He also served  as the antiquary for the Royal Academy, and his works were on display  there between 1787 and 1789 (ODNB).
 
The fourth and fifth references are in the collection catalogues of  Richard Heber and Edward Littledale. Heber’s vast collection was sold at  several auctions, spread over more than a year, and the Night Thoughts listing is found in Bibliotheca  Heberiana. Catalogue of the Library of the Late Richard Heber, Esq.  Part the Seventh, Removed from His House at Pimlico. Which Will Be Sold  by Auction, by Mr. Evans ([London], 1835). It is lot 6789: “Young’s (E.) Night Thoughts, with Blake’s Designs, 1797” (305). Littledale’s copy is in the Catalogue of the Library of the Late Edward Littledale, Esq. … Sold by Auction by Mr. Evans ([London], 1837), lot 2890: “Young’s Night Thoughts, plates by Blake, 1797” (124).
 
Heber’s and Littledale’s copies are significant because both collectors were members of the Roxburghe Club, as were fellow Night Thoughts  owners T. F. Dibdin and Francis Wrangham. Dibdin belonged to the  Roxburghe Club from its founding in 1812 until 1843, and served as the  club’s secretary. He met Blake in 1816 and owned several copies of the  illuminated books, but it is not known which copy of Night Thoughts he owned. Heber was also an original member of the Roxburghe Club, while Littledale joined in 1813. Dibdin  had a great interest in Heber’s collection, and after Heber’s death he  played a major role in organizing and cataloguing the collection until  the latter’s sister dismissed him for unknown reasons.Arnold Hunt, “The Sale of Richard Heber’s Library,” Under the Hammer: Book Auctions since the Seventeenth Century,  ed. Robin Myers, Michael Harris, and Giles Mandelbrote (New Castle  [Delaware]: Oak Knoll Press; London: British Library, 2001) 143-71.
 
Wrangham was a relative latecomer to the club, joining in 1822, but  like Dibdin, he would have brought a great deal of information about  Blake. In addition to his copy of Night Thoughts, Wrangham also owned the Descriptive Catalogue, the illustrations to Hayley’s Designs to a Series of Ballads, Blair’s The Grave, and the engravings of Job.Bentley, Blake Books Supplement (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995) 284. His own copy of Night Thoughts may have been obtained quite early, since he knew Richard Edwards, who published his Reform: A Farce (London, 1792) and sold copies of his Restoration of the Jews (Cambridge, 1795). Reform was a satire of Thomas Paine written under the pseudonym “S[amuel]. Foote, Jr.,”  which shows that Wrangham placed himself in the tradition of the comic  playwright Samuel Foote (bap. 1721–1777), whom Blake would attack in Jerusalem for his parodies of Methodism. In light of Blake’s later enmity to Foote, it may be significant that Reform makes a hostile reference to his and Fuseli’s “Fertilization of Egypt,” which had been published in Erasmus Darwin’s Botanic Garden. Attributing the design to Fuseli alone, Wrangham claims that what he calls “the Fertilization of Nile” was “borrowed from the Jupiter Pluvius of the Columna Antoniniana,” an engraving of which, in Pieter Burman’s Petronii Arbitri Satyricôn (1709), Wrangham reproduces to indicate the obvious borrowings.[Wrangham], Reform: A Farce (London, 1792) 6.  Since he makes no reference to Blake in the passage, however, how much  knowledge he possessed of Blake at this date is unclear. In addition to  his early connections to Edwards, Wrangham was a promoter of Leigh Hunt,  providing moral support at the time of his government prosecutionSee Wrangham’s 29 December 1808 letter of support to Hunt in The Correspondence of Leigh Hunt, vol. 1 (London: Smith, Elder and Co., 1862) 44-45. and making solicitations on behalf of the Examiner (ODNB). Given his interest in the Examiner, it is likely that he read Robert Hunt’s reviews of The Grave  and the 1809 exhibition, which he may have attended, and his Job  impressions suggest that he maintained an interest in collecting Blake’s  commercially available works.
 
Since neither Heber nor Littledale owned other works by Blake, it is  probable that their connection to Dibdin or Wrangham accounts for their  possession of Night Thoughts. Moreover, the ownership of Night Thoughts  by four members of the Roxburghe Club provides a new context for  Dibdin’s widely reprinted remarks on the illustrations. These were first  printed in The Library Companion, published two years after Wrangham had joined the club: Wherefore is it, that I love to read that portion  of the poem, published in a folio form, with bizarre but original and  impressive ornaments by Blake?  At times, the pencil of the artist* attains the sublimity of the poet:  and it is amidst the wild uproar of the wintry elements—when piping  winds are howling for entrance round every corner of the turretted  chamber, and the drifted snow works its way into the window casement,  however closely fastened—it is in moments like these  that I love to open that portion of the text of Young which has been  embellished by the pencil of Blake. My friends will laugh ..  peradventure deride .. but let us all be endured in these venial moments  of hallucination. The soul of poetry itself (we are told) is fiction: and I would feign happiness at such moments.Dibdin, The Library Companion (London, 1824) 734. Dibdin’s note refers to Isaac D’Israeli’s Blake collection: My friend Mr. D’Israeli possesses the largest  collection of any individual of the very extraordinary drawings of Mr.  Blake; and he loves his classical friends to disport with them, beneath  the lighted Argand lamp of his drawing room, while soft music is heard,  upon the several corridores [sic] and recesses of his enchanted staircase. Meanwhile the visitor turns over the contents of the Blakëan portefeuille. Heber, Littledale, Wrangham, and other club members may have been among  the “friends” who derided Dibdin’s dreamy admiration of Blake or among  the visitors who floated about D’Israeli’s private exhibitions of  Blake’s works. Where Heber and Littledale  obtained their copies is unclear, but it may suggest that Alexander  Akehurst’s 1824 claim that copies were “now reposing in the warehouses  of some of the London Booksellers” has some validity.Bentley, Blake Records, 2nd ed. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) 388.
 
The sixth new listing is in an advertisement for the Saturday, 10 November 1838 issue of the Athenaeum,  no. 576. The copy was offered by John Bryant at the Camden’s Head, 9  King William Street, and the advertisement reads: “YOUNG’S NIGHT  THOUGHTS, with Blake’s curious Designs, imp. 4to. large paper, half blue  mor. 1l. 16s. 1797.” Four previous listings had also described the illustrations as “curious.”
 
The seventh listing is in a Sotheby auction catalogue  dated 20 November 1839. Three collections were offered: one of a  deceased clergyman, one of a deceased gentleman, and a third whose owner  is not described. This last was the prize collection, with its key  items, like Audubon’s prints, highlighted on the title page. Blake’s Night Thoughts was in this collection, listed as lot 417: “Young’s Night Thoughts, with engravings after Blake 1797” (15). The error in not attributing the engravings to Blake may suggest that the compiler was familiar with The Grave,  since Blake did not engrave his designs in that work. Coincidentally,  in the copy of the catalogue held by the Bodleian and available through Google Books, the title page contains the signature of “Rev Dr  Bandinel,” the longtime Bodleian librarian, who was also a member of  the Roxburghe Club (1839–58). Bandinel’s membership commenced the year  of the catalogue, and he was also an acquaintance of Isaac D’Israeli.Marc  Vaulbert de Chantilly, “Property of a Distinguished Poisoner: Thomas  Griffiths Wainewright and the Griffiths Family Library,” Under the Hammer 130. I have not been able to access the catalogue of Bandinel’s own extensive collection to see if he owned any Blake items.
 
The final new listing can be found in the literary advertisements to the Gentleman’s Magazine for December 1839. The copy was offered by J. F. Setchel, No. 23 King Street, Covent Garden. It was listed as lot 747: “Young’s Night Thoughts, with Blake’s Designs, fol. 35s. hf.-bd. 1797” (13). This listing also emphasizes Blake’s designs over the engravings.

Blake portrays the Orthodox Jewish ritual for the priestly blessing in plate 17 of Illustrations of the Book of Job. This essay explains the ritual, analyzes Blake’s iconography, and argues why he resorts to this Jewish practice. 

1. Zeitgeist
 
A history describing religion and culture in the England of 1815 observes that the period was “remarkable for its intense [Christian] religious life.”Halévy 1: 387. The study of Hebrew and Greek was encouraged to promote the reading of the Old and New Testaments in their original languages. A man of his time, Blake studied Hebrew and incorporated it into his art.See Shiff.
 
Not appreciated today—and crucial to my argument—is that the  Protestant theologians also encouraged the study of Jewish religious  rituals to understand how the ancient Israelites implemented biblical  commandments. In the introduction to a book explaining Judaism to  Christians, the Methodist theologian and scholar Adam Clarke (c.  1762–1832) urged: I have now reason to hope  that every serious Christian, of whatever denomination, will find this  Volume a faithful and pleasant guide to a thorough understanding of all  the customs and manners, civil and religious, of that people to  whom God originally entrusted the Sacred Oracles. Without a proper  knowledge of these it is impossible to see the reasonableness and  excellency of that worship, and of those ceremonies, which God Himself  originally established among the Israelites ….Clarke vi. The “Volume” that Clarke refers to is a French book on the Jewish religion (based on Johannes Buxtorf’s Juden Schul)  by Abbé Claude Fleury (1640–1723, a member of the French Academy),  first translated into English in 1750. Clarke brought out three  subsequent editions, with the fourth edition of 1820 enhanced and  expanded. From Cromwell’s era there was a continuous immigration of religiously observant Jews to England. Succeeding  generations separated from the Orthodox Jewish tradition into which  they were born and educated, and assimilated into the predominant  society—some converting to Christianity, the ultimate assimilation.In  1943 Abraham Cohen, an English rabbi and scholar, posed the question,  what did Englishmen know about Jews and Judaism two or three centuries  ago? From systematically assembled extracts from diaries, letters, and  books of travel up to the Victorian era, he demonstrates the interest in  Hebrew and Jewish practice and the study of Jewish religious literature  by the clergy in Oxford and Cambridge, even before Cromwell’s time, and  the constant curiosity about Jewish practice wherever Englishmen  encountered Jews in foreign lands. He also gives examples of English  Jews assimilating and converting: “The majority of the Jewish families  which had settled in England under Cromwell, and prospered, disappeared  from the [Jewish] community within a century …” (Cohen, An Anglo-Jewish Scrapbook 221). In cosmopolitan London, Blake  had ready access to knowledge about Jewish religious rituals from  assimilated or converted Jews and from fellow Protestants who studied  Judaism to understand the roots of Christianity and to proselytize.See  Ruderman and also Spector, especially her “Introduction: The Politics  of Religion,” 1-13, and Schuchard’s “William Blake and the Jewish  Swedenborgians.”
 
2. Ritual
 
To make the iconography of the priestly blessing in plate 17 understandable, I begin by explaining the ritual. The priestly duty to bless the children of Israel is a biblical command.Numbers  6.22-27: “22. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying: 23. ‘Speak unto  Aaron and unto his sons, saying: On this wise ye shall bless the  children of Israel; ye shall say unto them: 24. The Lord bless thee, and  keep thee; 25. The Lord make His face to shine upon thee, and be  gracious unto thee; 26. The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee, and  give thee peace. 27. So shall they put My name upon the children of  Israel, and I will bless them’” (Cohen, The Soncino Chumash 825-26). In this ritual, the blessing is from God through the agency of priests. The Hebrew word for priest is kohen (כהן‎). Aaron, the brother of Moses, was the first Jewish kohen,In  the Orthodox tradition, a Jewish male attains the title of rabbi after  completing theological studies. A priest may study to become a rabbi. In  contrast, the title of priest is a birthright, automatically conferred  upon a male whose father is a priest. A rabbi who is not of patrilineal  descent from Aaron may not perform the priestly blessing or any other  role a priest has in the religious life of an Orthodox Jewish community.  A rabbi who happens to be a priest is obligated to observe the priestly  duties. and the blessing mandated of him  and his male descendants is a tradition that continues uninterrupted to  this day by men who are priests by patrilineal descent.Patrilineal  genealogy is embedded in the convention for naming children. Names in  Hebrew for ritual purposes follow the biblical formulation. First is the  individual’s given name﻿(s)﻿, then the relationship to the father,  followed by the father’s given name﻿(s)﻿, e.g., B the son of A, or C the  daughter of A. The honorific title Ha-Kohen (the priest) is  appended to the father’s name if he is a descendant of Aaron. The father  of Moses and Aaron was Amram, who was not a priest. Amram’s two sons  were Moses son of Amram and Aaron son of Amram. After Aaron was  appointed priest, his son was Eleazar son of Aaron the Priest. In turn,  Eleazar’s son was Phinehas son of Eleazar the Priest. This convention  maintains the tradition of priestly patrilineal genealogy. In the Orthodox Jewish tradition, the rite is performed only during certain prayer services to a congregation convened in a quorum.In  the Orthodox tradition, the minimum requirement for a quorum is ten  males who are thirteen or greater. The blessing is given if the quorum  contains one priest at least of age thirteen. At the appropriate point in the service, the priests gather in a group before the assembly and in unison chant words unchanged from biblical times.Among  the oldest biblical writings uncovered in Israel by archaeologists are  amulets with the priestly blessing. For details, see Barkay et al., “The  Challenges of Ketef Hinnom” and “The Amulets from Ketef Hinnom.” During the blessing, priests cover their heads and outstretched arms and hands with the talis (prayer shawl).The Hebrew word for prayer shawl is four letters (טלית‎)  pronounced in two syllables. In Israel, where the Sephardic dialect  predominates, it is pronounced “tah-lit,” while in the Ashkenazic  dialect, whose origin is in eastern Europe and which was spoken by Jews  in Blake’s London (and in which the author is educated), the  pronunciation is “tah-lis.” Today the transliteration is usually spelled  with a single “l” as talis or talit. The Encyclopaedia Judaica uses tallit: Tallit,  prayer shawl. Originally the word meant “gown” or “cloak.” This was a  rectangular mantle that looked like a blanket and was worn by men in  ancient times. At the four corners … tassels were attached in  fulfillment of the biblical commandment … (Num. 15:38-41). … After the  exile of the Jews [after the Romans destroyed the Second Temple] … and  their dispersion, they came to adopt the fashions of their gentile  neighbors …. The tallit was discarded as a daily habit and it became a religious garment for prayer; hence its later meaning of prayer shawl. The tallit is usually white and made either of wool, cotton, or silk …. Strictly observant Jews prefer [the tallit to be] made of coarse half-bleached lamb’s wool.  The congregation stands and faces the priests, but does not gaze  directly at their hands. The Bible does not detail the technical  methodology for performing the blessing. Maimonides (1135–1204), in the Mishneh Torah, his code of Jewish practice, describes the procedure: When the leader of the  congregation [leader of the prayers] reaches the blessing … all the  priests in the synagogue leave their places, proceed forward, and ascend  the duchan [the platform at the front of the synagogue on which is the heichel (ark containing the torah scrolls)]. They stand there, facing the heichel,  with their backs to the congregation …. [Then] they turn their faces to  the people [turn around to face the congregation], spread out their  fingers, lift up their hands shoulder high, and begin reciting ….Maimonides 2: 190-92. Maimonides wrote the Mishneh Torah in  classical Hebrew. He is known as the RAMBAM (pronounced in both Hebrew  and English as two syllables, “Rahm-Bahm”), which is the pronunciation  of the four-letter acronym (RMBM: רמבם‎) of his  Hebrew name: Rabbi Moses ben [son of] Maimon. “Maimonides” is the  Latinized version of “the son of Maimon.” His works translated into  Latin were available to Christian theologians who were not Hebraists.  After Maimonides there were other codes of Jewish law by rabbis of  different communities and traditions, none of which needs to be entered  into for the purposes of this paper. The practice for extending arms, hands, and fingers has several variations, with each priest using the tradition taught to him by his father.Gold  explains that “there are more than a dozen customs on how the Kohanim  [priests] hold their hands. All are equally valid …,” but illustrates  only two (41). Rubenstein shows five positions (23-26). Six are in Katz  (72-75), who advises that his “set of illustrations lists some of the  hand and finger positions in use today.” In Berg’s unpublished thesis  three hand positions are described, but not illustrated (74-75). Because  of duplication, these works portray only six of the multiple  traditional variations. The hands of the priests never touch the persons being blessed—there is no laying on of hands.Ritual  handwashing is required before priests may give the blessing. Touching  any person before completing the blessing renders a priest ritually  impure and unfit to make the benediction, and rewashing is required.  Priests are a clan of the tribe of Levy. In the days of the Temple, the  priests officiated, performing the sacrifices and blessings. The  patrilineal male descendants of Levy who were not of the priestly clan  provided support services, including the purifying ablutions of the  priests, and they are identified by the title Levite. The children of  Levites are named B the son of A, the Levite, or C the daughter of A,  the Levite. Today, in the Orthodox tradition, the obligation of washing  the hands of priests preparatory to the benediction continues for male  Levites.
 
A representation of one of the more common finger configurations is often engraved on the tombstones of priests. Raised hands show fingers extended (see illus. 2).Hands held for blessing is the traditional gravestone emblem for the priest; for the Levite it is a water pitcher. 


2.  An inscription on a tombstone in a New York City cemetery (photo by the  author). The three lines of Hebrew read (Hebrew is read from right to  left):Line 1: A two-letter abbreviation for the phrase “here is interred.” Line 2: The deceased’s two given names, Jacob Chaim.Line  3: A two-letter abbreviation for the phrase “the son of Reb” (Reb is a  general honorific title), the deceased’s father’s single given name,  Mordechai, and the title “the Priest.” The balance of the  inscription (not shown) has the dates of birth and death, the given and  family names in English, and a message appropriate to the memory of the  deceased.

 Because the monument’s surface is vertical, the observer perceives the  hands as held in an absolute upright position, which is not the actual  practice. In the synagogue, the priests hold their arms shoulder high,  fully extended, (near) parallel and horizontal. The hands are fully open  with fingers extended. The palms face down toward the ground. However,  because the priests stand on a platform at some level (if only one step)  above the congregation, the effect is for the palms to be presented  obliquely toward the assembly. 
As shown by the tombstone, the symmetrically arranged hands are in  contact at two points: thumb-tip to thumb-tip and index-finger tip to  index-finger tip. Of the fingers on each hand, some touch along their  full lengths, while others are separated: the thumb is apart from the  index finger; the index and middle fingers touch; the middle finger is  apart from the ring finger; and the ring and little fingers touch. The  religious significance is not in the touching, but in the gaps  established by the symmetrical separations. The gaps represent the lattice fence in the Song of Songs,Song  of Songs 2.9: “9. … Behold, he standeth behind our wall, He looketh in  through the windows, He peereth through the lattice” (Cohen, The Five Megilloth).  here metaphorically formed by the fingers at the ends of a priest’s  outstretched arms, interposed between God and God’s agent—the priest—and  the people receiving the blessing.
 
To summarize, the five characteristics of the ritual are:For  details of the ritual, its history in Orthodox Jewish practice, and the  prayer services during which the priestly blessing is given, see Gold.  After the Enlightenment, Jews in England (and elsewhere) separated from  the Orthodox tradition and adopted reformed religious practices,  including changes to the ritual of the priestly blessing. The Orthodox  practice is pertinent to this paper because the English Reform liturgy  is essentially post-Blake. A: Both arms are extended in parallel. B: Both arms are held horizontal. C: Fingers of both hands are held in a symmetrical pattern to create gaps. D: Palms are toward the recipients of the blessing. E: Recipients of the blessing do not gaze at the priest’s hands. God blesses Job in plate 17. Every one of the five characteristics of the priestly blessing is present.
 
Before I analyze the iconography, two points should be remembered.  First, how easily the ritual is described, especially when accompanied  by a demonstration of the hand position (see illus. 3).  This is all the information Blake would have needed to compose the  blessing scene in plate 17. Second, and more importantly, the technique  is not described in the Bible. Blake could not have known of it from  self-study of the plain text (the words in the Bible without exegetical  commentary).
 
3. Iconography
 
Plate 17 (illus. 1) depicts two sentences from the last chapter in Job. The plain text of Job 42.5 tells of Job’s gazing upon God.Blake  engraved Job 42.5 beneath the image: “I have heard thee with the  hearing of the Ear but now my Eye seeth thee.” The tableau shows Job  kneeling before Blake’s typical depiction of God—a figure with a pensive  expression and flowing hair and beard who radiates glory. Seven sentences further on God blesses Job (42.12).Job  42.12 is engraved beneath the image on plate 21: “So the Lord blessed  the latter end of Job more than the beginning.” Job, restored to  prosperity, is surrounded by his new family—the consequence of God’s  blessing. Blake conflates the two into a single composition to show God in the act of blessing. The five characteristics are present. A: Both arms are extended in parallel. B: Both arms are held horizontal. The first two are obvious in plate 17 and require no analysis. C: Fingers of both hands are held in a symmetrical pattern to create gaps. What Blake engraved requires close examination by magnification. The  configuration of the left hand is obvious, even when not enlarged.  Perceivable only when magnified are the telltale details of the right  hand. First, see illus. 3 for a diagrammatic comparison: the image from  the tombstone is illus. 3a, while illus. 3b is what Blake portrays in  plate 17.

 The enlargement makes evident the finger positions of the right hand and  the gaps created thereby: a mirror image of the left hand. 
In contrast, the hands in the watercolors for Thomas Butts and John  Linnell are not symmetrical (illus. 5-6). Absent in both drawings is the  symmetry of finger gaps, because Blake drew the right hand to be seen  on edge, and did not carefully detail that hand’s gaps (though the red  arrow in illus. 6 indicates one gap). Whatever his reason for not  showing the gaps in the drawings, Blake included this crucial feature in  the engraving.

Two differences between plate 17 and the tombstone require comment.  The first is that Blake shows the hands separated from one another. This  is not a concern, as hands symmetrically positioned but not in contact  is a traditional variation. The second difference is that Blake’s version of the finger gaps is not one of the six portrayed in the references I cited.See note 14.  Two of the five positions in Rubenstein and two of the six in Katz show  hands apart. In all instances, the configurations of hands and fingers  are symmetrical. The simplest assumption to explain Blake’s  configuration of finger gaps is that he never personally observed the  priestly blessing given in a synagogue, and that his source taught him  the positions shown in illus. 3b. Perhaps it is a  variant tradition alluded to but not illustrated in the references, or  it may be Blake’s understanding of a description he read somewhere.
 
Information about the ritual was readily available in books. A 1656 translation of Buxtorf’s Juden Schul gives this description: The Priest, putting on his Talles, which is a course hair cloth,For an explanation of a “talles” (talis) made from “course hair cloth,” see note 12.  which was folded about his neck over his head, so as it may hide his  eyes, blesses the people with the usuall benediction as was commanded Numb. 6.  Which while he pronounces, the people put their hands before their  faces, not daring to look upon his hands, because the spirit of God  rests on them during the benediction, as ’tis written Cant. 2.9. Behold he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the window, shewing himself through the lattesse. that is, God standeth behind the Priest, and looketh through the distances of his fingers.Ross  366. This translation is attributed to the clergyman and scholar  Alexander Ross (1591–1654). Buxtorf (1564–1629) was the preeminent  Protestant Hebraist of his generation, professor of Hebrew at Basel  University, author and publisher of Hebrew lexicons and rabbinic  literature, and the official censor of Hebrew publishing at Basel. He  had extensive contact with Jews at the Frankfurt book fairs and with the  Jewish proofreaders at the Basel press, and corresponded in Hebrew with  Jewish booksellers throughout Europe. For a biography of Buxtorf and  his son of the same name, an eminent Hebraist in his own right, and an  introduction to Protestant Christian Hebraist scholarship, see Burnett.  Buxtorf’s Juden Schul was published in nineteen editions,  translated into Dutch, French, Latin, and English, and became the  sourcebook for Christian theologians about Jewish religious practice. Additional detail is in another translation, from 1663: Then the Priest wrapping a great hair-cloth about  his neck, and drawing it over his head, so far untill it come to the  threshold of his eyes: he blesseth the people according to the ordinary  forme prescribed by Moses, Numbers the 6, the 24, 25, 26, and  27 verses. When he pronounceth the blessing, he stretcheth out his hands  towards the people: they covering their faces with their own; for it is  lawful for no man to look upon the hands of the Priests: because the  spirit of the Lord rests upon them, while he blesseth the Congregation. As it is written, He standeth behinde our wall looking forth at the windows, shewing himself through the grates,  that is to say, God stands at the Priests back, and looks through the  windows and grates, that is to say, through his hands being stretched  out, and his fingers being spread abroad severed one from another.A. B. 235. Versions of Buxtorf were published three times in London between 1734 and 1748.Johann Andreas Eisenmenger’s Entdecktes Judentum  was Englished by John Peter Stehelin and published in London in three  known editions with Buxtorf as an accompanying volume: 1734 (copy in the  New York Public Library); 1743 (Eighteenth Century Collections Online [ECCO] Part II); and 1748 (ECCO).  For Buxtorf’s description of the priestly blessing, see 2: 340. The  title page of the 1734 edition, vol. 1, states that the accompanying  work is “Abridg’d from the Latin of Buxtorff.” However, none of the descriptions gives detailed information about how the hands and fingers are configured.
 
Perhaps Blake adopted what he believed to be a Christian religious equivalent. He favored Albrecht Dürer,“Blake  was a print-seller for a time, and he had an extensive print collection  of his own, started in his boyhood and sold in 1821, when his poverty  was most severe. Nothing is known about what Blake sold or collected  except that his taste ran to Dürer and to sixteenth-century Italian  engravers, out of fashion at the time” (Johnson 154). whose Apocalypse woodcuts have examples of the hand position of illus. 3b (see illus. 7 and 8). If not from Dürer, then of course the model may have been from some other work. An exhaustive review of possible sources is beyond the scope of this paper.Warner  does not describe the hand and finger positions in plate 17, and she  makes no comment about Blake’s portraying the Jewish ritual of the  priestly blessing. She does suggest the possible influence on Blake by  John Bulwer. In 1644, Bulwer published a work describing the conventions  of hand and arm configurations used to embellish vocal orations, with  five charts of woodcuts depicting a subset of the many conventions  discussed. Warner reproduces three of the charts on pp. 50, 51, and 56  of her work. The chart on p. 50 has twenty-four images, of which image  Z, “Benedictione dimittit,” is Bulwer’s representation of the priestly  blessing. In the section of his text entitled Chironomia, Bulwer explains image Z in five pages (59-63): “Canon XLIX. Both Hands modestly extended and erected unto the shoulder points, is a proper forme of publicke benediction, for the Hands  of an Ecclesiasticall Oratour when hee would dismisse his Auditours.”  He then expounds on the significance of the gesture, drawing on the  Bible, Jewish tradition (as he understands it), Buxtorf’s Juden Schul,  Roman Catholic tradition, and the gestures used by Protestant preachers  that he personally observed. Although Bulwer describes the significance  of the finger positions, his visual representation (image Z) fails to  conform to the Jewish ritual, as the arms are vertical and the four  fingers of each hand are not symmetrically separated. The other  two-handed configurations in the chart that superficially resemble what  Blake engraved in plate 17 are described by Bulwer as other than  benedictions or the offering of blessings. Bulwer was not Blake’s  authority for plate 17. Cleary’s  1974 edition of Bulwer begins with a scholarly introduction, modernizes  Bulwer’s English, and translates his Latin quotations. In the notes,  Cleary identifies and lists as fully as possible the source documents  that are cryptic in Bulwer’s marginal notes and the sources for the  Latin quotations, and he also defines obscure terms. He does not,  however, comment on the images in the charts. Bulwer  (1644) and Cleary’s edition of Bulwer (1974) could not have been of any  assistance to Warner in recognizing what Blake did in plate 17.

Immanentistic Emblem
 
Had Blake depicted in plate 17 the finger gaps portrayed in illus. 3a, this alone would make it certain that he emulates the Jewish priestly blessing. Had he depicted the configuration of illus. 3b  in plate 17 and nowhere else, then it would unambiguously be associated  with God’s delivering a blessing. Nowhere, however, do I observe his  using the positions of illus. 3a. Instead, he uses those of illus. 3b in  many compositions, most of which do not obviously show God in the act  of blessing. Four such examples are in illus. 9-12. A  survey of Butlin finds forty-two images with one or more instances of  the positions of illus. 3b in a wide variety of settings and themes.Butlin  pls. 57-58, 102-03, 122, 125, 151, 177, 185, 201, 223, 288, 305-06,  417-18, 497, 506, 508, 511, 522, 535, 557, 560, 570, 588-89, 647, 684,  686-88, 696, 700, 890, 892, 920, 962-63, 965, 1017, and 1095. Pl. 892, Christ Blessing  (c. 1810), has the fingers of both hands configured as in illus. 3b,  but without any of the other characteristics of the Jewish priestly  blessing.
 
Joseph H. Wicksteed provides a solution in describing Blake as an “immanentalist.”“But for an immanentalist like Blake …” (Wicksteed 27). I suggest that Blake (who was steeped in the emblem tradition, as Mary Lynn Johnson explains)See Johnson.  adopted the finger positions of illus. 3b as an emblem. Francis Quarles  (1592–1644) defines the religious meaning of emblems in his Emblemes, which pairs parables expressed in words with their equivalents in woodcut images: TO THE READER. An Embleme is but a silent Parable.  Let not the tender Eye checke, to see the allusion to our blessed  Saviour figured, in these Types. In holy Scripture, He is sometimes  called a Sower; sometimes, a Fisher; sometimes, a Physitian: And why not  presented so, as well to the eye, as to the eare? Before the knowledge  of letters, God was knowne by Hierogliphicks; And, indeed, what are the Heavens, the Earth, nay every Creature, but Hierogliphicks and Emblemes of His Glory?Quarles sig. A3. The hand with fingers configured as in illus. 3b is an immanentistic  emblem that represents God’s ever-present blessing (see illus. 9-12). It  is for this purpose, I suggest, that Blake used it in many  compositions, including plate 17 where it is certain that God is  blessing Job.

Theme in Variation
 
Plate 17 is not alone in showing outstretched arms held parallel, as Blake uses this configuration in three other plates in Illustrations of the Book of Job. Alexander Gilchrist perceives the repetition to be an artistic flaw;“Such  defects as exist in these [Job] designs are of the kind usual with  Blake …. The lifted arms and pointing arms in plates 7 and 10 are pieces  of mannerism to be regretted, the latter even seeming a reminiscence of  Macbeth’s Witches by Fuseli …” (Gilchrist 1: 289). I suggest that it is a theme in variation. In plate 7  (illus. 13) Job’s friends raise parallel arms vertically with fingers  splayed. This is not a blessing but a gesture of alarm and dismay.

 In plate 8  (illus. 14) Job, in profound grief, raises beseeching arms to heaven.  The hands and fingers form symmetrical gaps, but the arms, though  parallel, are vertical. This is Job seeking benediction; he is not  stretching out his arms to give a blessing.

 In plate 10  (illus. 15) Job’s three friends point directly at him with arms parallel  and horizontal, jutting forward from the shoulders.

 Compare plate 10 to another emphatic double-arm pointing gesture, from Night Thoughts  three decades earlier (illus. 16), where we see the expected convention  for a pointing hand—closed fist and extended index finger.

 In contrast, Blake engraves plate 10 with the fingers splayed in  different directions. Extended fingers not held symmetrically to form  the metaphorical lattice fence cannot be a configuration for a blessing,  and in this plate the gesture is an accusatory condemnation. Blake used the same expression of censorious judgment in a sketch for Tiriel Denouncing His Sons and Daughters (c. 1789).Butlin pl. 224. Jeanne Moskal also recognizes the gesture in other works: “This motif [﻿in plate 10﻿] recalls other Blakean portrayals of accusation ….”Moskal 23. Only in plate 17  does Blake bring together arms, hands, and fingers properly configured  for forming the metaphorical lattice fence necessary for the blessing  ritual. 
D: Palms are toward the recipients of the blessing. In plate 17, God’s palms face toward Job—there is no laying on of hands.Blake  depicts God’s hands above Job’s head. There is a custom (not a  biblically ordained commandment) for parents to bless children at home  on Friday evenings at the start of the Jewish Sabbath by the laying on  of hands. The father places his hands on the head of the oldest child  and invokes a blessing (not necessarily using the words of the priestly  blessing), then repeats the process with each child in age order. In  some families the mother does the same. This is not the priestly  blessing, which is restricted to priests in a congregation convened in a  quorum for prayer, and does not utilize the laying on of hands.  The composition places God and Job in close proximity, so Blake could  easily have put the hands of God on Job’s head, had he chosen to do so.  See illus. 17 for an example of Blake’s depicting the laying on of  hands. In contrast, the blessing in plate 17 is from a distance.

E: Recipients of the blessing do not gaze at the priest’s hands. Throughout the Job plates, whenever Blake portrays God and humans in the same tableau, the humans do not look at God’s radiating glory.Plate  2 is composed of two separate tableaus, God in heaven and humans on  earth. The humans are not in the presence of God’s glory. We see the  same in plate 5. Plate 9 depicts a dream discussed by one of Job’s  friends—God is not present, as he is recalled in the dream, which is  shown in a “balloon” of clouds. In plate 13 Blake has Job’s wife and  friends present when God appears (the friends hide their faces, but  Job’s wife does not). The compositional separation is the whirlwind.  Plate 14 shows two tableaus, humans beneath heaven, and God above. Two  tableaus are depicted in plates 15 and 16 also.  In plate 17 Job’s  friends avert their faces (though one attempts to peek), but his wife  does not. Plate 18 has the smoke from the burnt offering on the altar  ascending without turbulence; this is proof of acceptance by God. The  human figures kneel with eyes averted, except for Job, who looks upward  toward the glorious radiance that Blake associates with God. Job does  not look upon God, because God is not portrayed in the tableau. Finally,  in plate 20, God is depicted on a decorative panel behind Job, with the  humans in the panel bowed and not looking at God. God is not in the  foreground with Job, and the daughters have no need to hide their faces.  In the biblical plain text, God blesses Job, with no mention of the  presence of Job’s wife or friends. With artistic liberty, Blake includes  them in plate 17. Job’s friends avert their eyes (though one attempts  to peek). This is consistent with the practice that a congregation does  not look at the priest’s hands during the ritual—the hands form the  representation of the lattice fence, with God’s presence on the far  side. Job also does not look directly upon God (see illus. 18).

 Andrew Wright offers an interpretation for what he perceives as Job’s incongruous behavior.“Before  Job can be accepted [by God] he must be trained to see. The theme is  insistent here, for the numerous texts which appear in the borders have  as their common feature the injunction to look, and the principal  motto—it appears in the lower border—is, ‘I have heard of thee by the  hearing of the ear, but now my eye seeth thee’. And yet Job is not  looking at God, who stands directly above him and his wife; he stares  away, into the middle distance. The vision which he has been taught, and  which now at last he has learned, is inward …” (Wright 43). I  suggest that it is nothing other than Blake’s representing the  traditional synagogue practice of averting one’s gaze so as not to look  at the priest’s hands during the blessing. 
A comparison of the Butts and Linnell drawings confirms that Blake  intended the plate to represent the synagogue ritual. Job avoids gazing  at God in the Butts image (illus. 5), but looks directly at him in the Linnell (illus. 6). Why this difference? The Linnell is in conformance with the biblical plain text of Job 42.5 (see illus. 1):  “I have heard thee with the hearing of the Ear but now my Eye seeth  thee.” The Butts conforms to the synagogue ritual of avoiding gaze.  Blake evaluates the two compositions. The quandary is that he cannot  have it both ways and must choose one over the other for the engraving. He chooses to engrave the synagogue ritual.I  offer no comments on the other differences: (1) In the Butts, God is  erect, whereas he is stooped in the Linnell—the Linnell version is  chosen for the engraving; (2) The three friends kneel forward toward God  in the Butts, and away from him in the Linnell—again Blake chooses the  Linnell version. Not pertinent to this analysis are the pencil sketch  for the design and the New Zealand set (see Illustrations of the Book of Job by William Blake fascicles IV and V and, for the sketch, the William Blake Archive [Drawings and Paintings, Pencil Sketches, Sketchbook Containing Drawings for the Engraved Illustrations to the Book of Job, object 23]).
 
Avoiding gaze is a subtle feature in the watercolor God Blessing the Seventh Day (c. 1803–05) (illus. 19).Keynes dates the painting to “about 1803” (William Blake’s Illustrations to the Bible xii); Butlin (1: 336) suggests c. 1805. 


19. Blake, God Blessing the Seventh Day (c. 1803–05). Private collection.Photo: Art Resource, NY.

 An observer sees a frontal view of God in the act of blessing. The  recipient of the blessing, the seventh day, is not in the composition.  At first impression, Blake apparently places the viewer, who is outside  the composition, in the position of the seventh day, as if God blesses  the observer. 
This is Blake’s typical depiction of God—pensive expression, flowing  hair and beard, radiating glory. Four of the ritual’s characteristics  are obvious. Palms are toward the observer. The hands are symmetrically  held at shoulder height, with fingers arranged as in illus. 3b.  The arms are parallel, but not extended horizontally. I explain the  arms folded at the elbows by assuming artistic liberty—Blake is avoiding  the foreshortening effect that would occur if the arms were horizontal  and fully outstretched, jutting forward at shoulder height into the  observer’s space.
 
The last characteristic, averting gaze, is present but deliberately  not made obvious. W. Graham Robertson, an owner of this painting and an  artist himself, offers this criticism: “The colour throughout is fine, and the design impressive, but the central Figure [God] cannot be considered successful.”Robertson 119. The editor quotes Robertson’s and Rossetti’s descriptions of God Blessing the Seventh Day.  Rossetti described it as “very characteristic and fine”; Robertson,  however, criticized Blake’s portrayal of God. Did Blake really err? The  difficulty, I suggest, is not with Blake’s execution, but with  Robertson’s comprehension. Because he lived in a later zeitgeist,  Robertson more than likely lacked Blake’s knowledge of Jewish religious  practice and was unable to recognize the subtle but critical feature of  averted gaze in a painting whose theme is God in the act of blessing.  The challenge of living in a different zeitgeist also applies to Wright  (see note 37), who did perceive the averted gaze in plate 17 but could not decipher Blake’s intention.  He does not explain what he finds disturbing—I surmise it is the  direction of God’s gaze. God should be looking directly at the seventh  day he is blessing, as in plate 17 where he looks directly at Job. If  the observer is standing in the position supposedly occupied by the  seventh day, there should be eye-to-eye contact when the observer looks  at God’s face. Instead, God appears focused elsewhere. Here Blake  introduces the synagogue practice that those who are receiving the  blessing do not look directly upon God, who is beyond the metaphorical  lattice fence formed by the priest’s fingers. Blake has God focused on  the seventh day, not on the observer. The painting is a depiction of God  blessing the seventh day, just as the title indicates. It is the  seventh day that should avert gaze, not the observer. Thus, there is no  eye-to-eye contact.
 
Finally, observe the six angelic figures flanking God, with all wings  (but two) folded and in which God nestles, as if seated on a throne of  angel feathers. Each angel holds aloft one hand, palm side out, the  fingers of which are in the position of illus. 3b, echoing the blessing theme. (Why six angels? Possibly the six days that precede the seventh day.)
 
In both God Blessing the Seventh Day and plate 17, Blake  depicts the characteristics of the Orthodox Jewish synagogue ritual for  the priestly blessing. The feature he chooses to make subtly obscure  differs, however. In God Blessing the Seventh Day it is an  averted gaze; in plate 17 the hidden feature is the finger gaps of the  right hand. Blake deliberately introduces subtleties. Another example is  in the watercolor Job’s Evil Dreams (Butts set), where three  Hebrew words intended to represent a portion of the Ten Commandments are  not a commandment at all, but a hidden message. “Blake  precisely depicts the plain text of the Bible …. He then adds imagery  not in the Bible …. Blake deliberately made the slogan appear to be a  commandment—a visual illusion.”Shiff pars. 19-20. A future essay will argue why Blake does this.
 
Unanswered is which came first, Blake’s knowledge of the priestly blessing whence he developed the emblematic symbol (illus. 3b),  or his adoption of an existing Christian convention, later to be  incorporated into the compositions where God blesses in plate 17 and God Blessing the Seventh Day. The dating is instructive. God Blessing the Seventh Day is c. 1803–05. “Look What a Fine Morning It Is” (illus. 10), clearly not the depiction of a priestly blessing and just the use of an immanentistic emblem,Arms  are not parallel. Palms are not facing down. The figure is not a Jewish  priest. The setting is not a synagogue with a quorum in attendance. The  full title indicates that the hand gesture is Blake’s emblematic  representation for God’s ever-present blessing: “Look what a fine  morning it is._Insects, Birds, and Animals, are all enjoying  existence.” Not  surveyed for this paper is the earliest occurrence in Blake’s work of  the gesture as a stand-alone emblematic symbol, or its use by other  artists. is 1791. By the end of his stay in Felpham  (1800–03) or soon after, Blake knew and used all of the features  characteristic of the Jewish priestly blessing.
 
4. Verisimilitude
 
Blake painted biblical scenes for his patron Butts, including Zacharias and the Angel (illus. 20).

 The painting depicts the New Testament story (Luke) where an angel  appears before Zacharias while he is performing priestly duties inside  the Temple. Blake’s creative challenge is to draw  upon his artistic imagination to represent convincingly the Temple  scene by portraying the high priest’s garb and the various implements  used in the sacred rites, while faithfully adhering to the Old  Testament’s description of the costume and objects.Baetjer  (“[Item] 88. The Angel Appearing to Zacharias,” 178-80) quotes the  entry from the 1906 Carfax Gallery catalogue: “Blake represents in  minute detail the furniture and vestments ordained by the Law.” The  “Law” refers to the Old Testament. 
Verisimilitude, then, is the critical concept in understanding the iconography of the Bible series and Illustrations of the Book of Job.  However, because there is no description in the Bible as to how God  goes about giving a blessing, or the technique by which the priests are  to perform the rite, Blake must rely on the synagogue practice of the  Jews for a model.
 
The verisimilitude argument raises a problem that may not be ignored.  In plate 17 God’s hands hover above either side of Job’s head. Clearly,  the blessing is for Job alone, and this depiction is consistent with  the Bible’s plain text. Contrary to the biblical story is the presence  of Job’s wife, who is beside him as if also receiving the blessing, and  who gazes directly at God. Why Blake gives her a prominence that is the  antithesis of verisimilitude remains to be explored in a future essay.
 
Conclusion
 
Blake was a religious personality in a Christian zeitgeist that  promoted and encouraged the study of the Israelite implementation of  God’s revealed Law. In cosmopolitan London knowledge about Judaism was  readily available. It should not be surprising that Blake relied upon  the Orthodox Jewish synagogue ritual of the priestly blessing as his  model for depicting how God blesses Job.

“Surely gold-dust may be descried in these notes,” Gilchrist wrote about Blake’s annotations to Lavater’s Aphorisms on Man. “To me they seem mentally physiognomic …. We, as through a casually open window, glance into the artist’s room, and see him meditating at his work, graver in hand” (1: 66-67, cited in Erle 8). Sibylle Erle’s book explores how professional work on Lavater’s publications may have inspired Blake’s meditations as he, “graver in hand,” worked on the Urizen books. What is most impressive about her study is the careful detail on the publication history of Lavater’s work and the personal relationships involved. These practical aspects of the development of physiognomy inform Erle’s theorizing as much as the concept itself does. She uses physiognomy as a framework for thinking through a range of metaphysical and textual relations: original and copy, body and soul, (divine) creator and creature, text and image, work and edition, writer and reader.
  
This is very much a focused study in which Lavater predominates (perhaps even slightly over Blake) and discussion of Blake’s works concentrates on The Book of Urizen. The book is less strong on placing these figures in a wider contemporary context, but it seems unfair to demand this when the restricted focus paradoxically brings Blake out of his familiar geographical context, famously limited to London, except for his “three years slumber on the banks of the Ocean” (E 145) and, of course, frequent forays into Eternity. Erle’s thorough knowledge of the German and British settings puts her in an exceptionally good position to elucidate a Blake connected to international literary, philosophical, and artistic circles, participating in collective publication projects that circulate knowledge between Britain and the Continent. Indeed, one of the most attractive features of the book is its attention to the intellectual exchanges and emotional bonds between men. In Erle’s view of the annotations to Lavater, we see a Blake who is, perhaps surprisingly, as eager to please, heartily agree, and find affinities as he is to denounce Error. As Erle points out, the heart he draws around his name and Lavater’s “is an unusual choice for Blake” (99). We also see, in Lavater’s and Fuseli’s impossibly large-scale ambitions for their work, and their unashamed resentments, that Blake is not the only one who can come across as a crank.
  
The close concentration sometimes leads to exclusive claims, such as “Lavater’s physiognomy prompted Blake to explore the body’s relationship with the soul” (5) and “the publication history of Essays on Physiognomy would have introduced Blake to the idea of a self-reflective author … as well as an open text to which he expects his readers to contribute” (164), as if these things would not have occurred to Blake without Lavater, or from any other source. However, the arguments themselves are more convincing and nuanced than such overstatements suggest. Erle’s prose also has a pleasing directness, but there are abrupt shifts of topic that can be somewhat bewildering, and that leave many enticing suggestions for the reader to extrapolate. Because Erle is placing so much detail in multilevel juxtaposition, there is a sense that she has all the facts and parallels present in her mind, while the reader must gradually catch up as the book builds momentum. And from this there is an eagerness in her readings, a desire to get to the “gold-dust.”
  
The first few chapters seem torn, having their own arguments to make while they must also serve introductory purposes and lay factual and theoretical groundwork. Chapter 1 considers what is a good copy, in light of the problem of an elusive original. Erle introduces parallels between God’s creation of Adam and Eve, Lavater’s search for authentic physiognomical portraits, and Blake’s claim to “copy Imagination” (E 574, quoted in Erle 27). Chapter 2 looks at portraits in book illustration and takes on, with reference to Reynolds, the aesthetic issue of the general versus the particular, clearly crucial to physiognomy, where features of individual faces typify shared character traits. It is in chapter 3 and its accompanying interlude that the book begins to take off. In Physiognomische Fragmente, Lavater chooses to use silhouettes as a faithful and objective form of likeness. Erle describes the “silhouette chair” often used to trace these images, and tracks Lavater’s failed efforts to invent a “Stirnmesser,” or forehead-measuring device, that could be employed by any learner of physiognomy (70). She then ingeniously applies this to The Book of Urizen, reading it as a satire of “Lavater’s attempts at combining perfect likeness with perfect measuring devices” (78): the shadows and nets in the poem are analogous to the silhouettes and the measuring grids imposed upon them in Lavater’s book. When the Eternals look at the “shadow of horror,” name him “Urizen,” and classify him as a “Demon,” they form their estimation of his character based on examining Urizen’s silhouette (79). When Los shapes Urizen with “nets and gins,” these tools do not serve him very well in making good likenesses; the body always resists (82). The implications are intriguing as they apply to Orc’s birth. Since the flaming child emits light, the tent imposed by the Eternals becomes a screen for silhouettes (89). It comes out at the end of Erle’s study that perhaps Orc is not, after all, one of the very few in Blake born in the ordinary way: she argues he is a case of “creation by shadow-casting” (195), with comparison to the Incarnation. While Lavater’s oeuvre moves from silhouette to portrait in a quest for good likeness, Blake shows it is Enitharmon’s body, not Los’s machines, that can turn a shadow into flesh and blood (197).
  
Chapters 4 and 5 are dedicated to Aphorisms on Man, first examining Fuseli’s role as translator and very hands-on editor, justified by his intimate knowledge of the author in this “labour of love” for Lavater (99). It is interesting that the instructions for annotating Aphorisms were an addition by Fuseli (98), turning the text into an interactive exercise also based on fellowship: agreeing or disagreeing amiably with the personality who wrote the aphorisms, and showing the resulting textual physiognomic profile to friends. Chapter 5 analyzes the layers of Blake’s annotations, seeing him as more than merely responding, playing the role of friend and editor, noting not only “where he differs from Lavater” but also “where Lavater failed to understand himself” (121). One notable point made in this chapter is that Nathaniel Tucker, in his translation of Swedenborg’s The Wisdom of Angels, Concerning Divine Love and Divine Wisdom in 1788, refers in a footnote to Aphorisms on Man before Fuseli’s translation was published, revealing an earlier awareness of the book in England, and among Swedenborgians. This is particularly excellent textual history sleuthing, as the “footnote disappeared from the second edition” in 1816. Another fine offering in this chapter is an extended and multifaceted explication of Blake’s rather puzzling biblical reference to the Ark of the Covenant against aphorism number 533. 
  
Erle’s insights on “tensions between text and image” (146) are at their most incisive in chapter 6, tracing the publication project of Henry Hunter’s translation of Essays on Physiognomy. One curious detail is that, in the production of this multi-volume opus, “because the full-page designs were issued as soon as the engravers had finished them, and not necessarily in the same order that the printed text was published, they frequently appear in fascicles with unrelated text” (135), drawing attention to a way in which Blake’s seemingly bizarre disjunctions have more in common with conventional printing than might be expected. Hunter’s edition made much of the improvement of the illustrations from previous versions, but this emphasis, as Erle’s analysis shows, only underscores how often Lavater’s accompanying text criticizes the flaws in the designs. His text is a supplement to correct the image that fails to represent the elusive original. This, of course, is personal, since it affects the reputations of the artists involved (especially Fuseli, as criticism of the previous French translation had targeted his illustrations). Further, personal knowledge is appealed to: where Lavater knows the person being represented, his physiognomical conclusions can be verified, and the inaccuracies of the portrait revealed, by reference to the actual person. Comparisons with the original are invited also in a debate over heads engraved after Raphael (143). In both cases, access is quite exclusive. Blake, for one, was not in the position to test a Raphael engraving against a Raphael.
  
Chapter 7 brings out what is implied in Lavater’s (and Blake’s) taking on the task “to edit and illustrate the sixth day of creation” (173). Like biblical editors such as Alexander Geddes, “physiognomists are obliged to identify and omit” what appears to be corrupt in the received versions of God’s works (182). The overview of Geddes and Lowth, Paine and Priestley seems somewhat obligatory, though the references to Paine emphasize the idea of being able to agree and disagree with the Bible as a text like Aphorisms on Man, and suggest that Lavater’s books on physiognomy might function, in light of Paine’s arguments, as “proof for revelations” or “evidence” that “God created man in his likeness” (173). This chapter adds anatomical illustration as another parallel attempt at accurate representation.  The figures Erle discusses are William Hunter as professor of anatomy at the Royal Academy when Blake studied there, and Lavater’s son Johann Heinrich Lavater, who published an introduction to anatomy for artists in 1824. He visited the Royal Academy in 1789, so Erle imagines Blake might have encountered him then through Fuseli. It is unfortunate that there doesn’t seem to be a definite connection between Blake, or Lavater, and the other figure Erle considers on this topic, Ebenezer Sibly, because the material is intriguing. Also, given her attention to the reputation of physiognomy as a pseudoscience, one would be curious to hear what Erle makes of Sibly’s preoccupation with the occult: the full title of his Key to Physic (given in the bibliography) is A Key to Physic, and the Occult Sciences, Opening to Mental View, the System and Order of the Interior and Exterior Heavens, which sounds as if it would have rather more affinity with Swedenborg’s perspective than William Hunter’s. Erle is most interested in the formation of the bones in the foetus, because of Blake’s foetal skeleton in Urizen, and because of the physiognomical problem of accident and essence, related to the surface and depth structures of flesh and bone. The quotation from Sibly’s Medical Mirror, or Treatise on the Impregnation of the Human Female (1796, frustratingly later than Urizen’s title-page date of 1794) explaining how “the foetus loses its transparency”—“the nucleus of the bone … is … the centre from which ossification proceeds, till it reaches the circumference” (quoted in Erle 179)—begs for a connection to the imagery of center and circumference, translucence and opacity, running through Milton and Jerusalem. For instance: every-thing in Eternity is translucent: The Circumference is Within: Without, is formed the Selfish Center And the Circumference still expands going forward to Eternity. (Jerusalem 71.6-8, E 225)
  
There is also much artistic imagery in the passages from Sibly that could fruitfully be explicated, as the effect of the interior passions and even “material organs” of the body on its appearance is envisioned as a canvas being painted (Sibly, cited in Erle 180). Most remarkably, there is engraving imagery in a quoted passage from Lavater’s own Essays on Physiognomy: It is the pressure … of the muscles, and that of the parts adjoining to the bones, which engrave upon their surface, and even in their substance, all sorts of designs and furrows. On the surface of the scull chiefly are to be found distinct marks of the manner of life followed by the party to whom it belonged. (2: 149, quoted in Erle 179) Erle comments on essence, but there are interpretive possibilities lurking here: the pressure of Blake’s own muscles as he works the metal, as well as Blake’s plates as textual bodies, and the “scull” enclosing each “cavern’d Man” in his own identity. That last sentence of Lavater’s is like a description of the frontispiece to Visions of the Daughters of Albion.
  
The final interlude, along with the conclusion, brings together Erle’s overall interpretation of the Urizen books. The divine original is not perfect or stable; indeed, we do not know what Urizen looked like to start with. Back in the first interlude, Erle points out that “many worried they might be included into Physiognomische Fragmente” as silhouette examples “against their will” (79), a kind of eighteenth-century identity theft that reflects on the intensely unwilling nature of Urizen’s binding. Physiognomy is a two-way street: “identity is confirmed by looking” (189), but as Blake, and Erle, insist, there is always somebody looking back.

Appendix: New Information on Blake’s Engravings
 
 
  
After two hectic years, Blake collectors deserved a respite. It was not to be. January brought to auction Two Visionary Figures (illus. 10) on a leaf from the Smaller Blake-Varley Sketchbook and, for the second time in seven years, The Gambols of Ghosts According with Their Affections Previous to the Final Judgement (illus. 7), one of Blake’s watercolor illustrations to Robert Blair’s The Grave. The estimate range for Gambols was considerably lower than in 2006, when bidders failed to exceed the reserve price. Sotheby’s New York succeeded this time at the top estimate of $600,000 ($722,500 inclusive of the buyer’s premium charged by the auction house).
 
In my 2012 sales review I mentioned Arthur Vershbow’s death and the pending auctions of the wide-ranging collection he and his wife, Charlotte, assembled over many years, including posthumous copy p of Songs of Innocence and of Experience, containing 42 plates, and two drawings by Blake, Colinet and Thenot, with Shepherds’ Crooks and The Waking of Leonora (illus. 3-6, 11). The illuminated book and the illustration to Gottfried Augustus Bürger’s Lenore were offered on 9 April by Christie’s New York. The last posthumous copy of the Songs sold at auction was in 1981, when it fetched $15,000 (copy h, 57 impressions of 54 plates; see Blake 15.1 [summer 1981]: 59-60 and 16.2 [fall 1982]: 87). More recently, single impressions have changed hands at about the same price. Some plates in the Vershbow copy were unevenly inked and printed. The Waking of Leonora had serious condition issues. For these reasons, when I learned in mid-January of Christie’s estimates, I thought that they were optimistic, but was quickly disabused of that notion when the scruffy doodle from the Blake-Varley Sketchbook made its high estimate of $18,000 ($22,500 with the buyer’s premium).
 
I did not attend this first Vershbow auction but watched it on Christie’s webcam. Bidding on the Songs seemed lackluster but managed to achieve a hammer price at the low estimate of $100,000 ($123,750 with the buyer’s premium).Beginning 11 March 2013, Christie’s charged the buyer 25% on amounts up to $75,000, 20% on amounts thereafter to $1.5 million, and 12% on amounts above $1.5 million. Beginning 15 March 2013, Sotheby’s charged 25% on amounts up to $1 million, 20% between $1 and $2 million, and 12% thereafter. Two bidders quickly drove the Leonora watercolor well past the high estimate of $80,000. The work sold for a hammer price of $170,000 ($207,750 with the premium). I have not been able to discover the purchaser of either lot, but both were knocked down to Felix de Marez Oyens, an “international consultant” for Christie’s, probably acting for a private collector or collectors. John Windle suggests that the purchaser of the watercolor may have been a German collector because of the importance of Bürger’s poem to the literary history of that nation.Lenore, first published in 1774, quickly became famous and immensely influential. It was translated into all the major European languages under several variant titles, including Leonora, Leonore, and Ellenore.
 
It was not until 29 October that Christie’s offered Colinet and Thenot (illus. 6), a preliminary drawing for one of Blake’s Virgil wood engravings, and other works by Blake from the Vershbow collection. Blake’s illustrations for Ambrose Philips’s “imitation” of Virgil’s first eclogue are among the most important and influential in the history of British wood engraving. A Virgil drawing (Butlin #769.19) sold at auction in 1992 for $79,750, including the buyer’s premium; two in one lot (Butlin #769.2, 13) fetched £71,900 in 1997. I had expected bidding for the Vershbow example, Butlin #769.3, to race through the $40,000-$60,000 estimate. Thus I was pleasantly surprised when the drawing was acquired by Windle, bidding on my behalf, at $32,000 ($40,000 with the premium).
 
In 1785 Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy a group of three watercolors illustrating the biblical account of Joseph and his brothers (Butlin #155-57, Fitzwilliam Museum). His career as an original artist seemed to be well underway at that time along stylistic lines established by the neoclassicism of Benjamin West and James Barry. A large (for Blake) and vigorous preliminary watercolor for one of the exhibited works, Joseph Ordering Simeon to Be Bound, came to market at Sotheby’s London on 3 July with an estimate of £20,000-30,000 (illus. 8). John Windle, acting for me, appears to have been the only bidder. The drawing was quickly sold at £22,000 (£27,500 including the buyer’s premium). Condition issues may have dissuaded some collectors, yet the problems in this instance were less severe than with the Leonora watercolor. The sales of these two works within a dozen weeks of each other demonstrate how difficult it is to predict the outcome of auctions. The falling prices for Blake’s Virgil drawings—almost a 50% discount between 1992 and 2013—deepen the uncertainties.
 
Two recto/verso plates from The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, untraced since 1938, turned up in early November—see the first entry under Illuminated Books, below, and illus. 1-2.
 
The Blake materials collected by Maurice Sendak remain in his estate.See Blake 46.4 (spring 2013): par. 5. In the list of works in Sendak’s collection I failed to include the clippings from Jerusalem pls. 18/19 and 28/35 (see BBS 87). I had expected that his collection would go to the Rosenbach Museum and Library, Philadelphia, but that may be true only for books. The Blakes, or at least some of them, might come to market in the next few years.
 
Online catalogues continue to surprise with rare prints by and after Blake—see “Zephyrus and Flora” under Separate Plates and the Blair (pl. 4 proof, illus. 15), Bonnycastle, Earle, Hogarth (Quaritch printing), and Wollstonecraft, Marie et Caroline, entries under Letterpress Books with Engravings by and after Blake. While not among Blake’s major achievements, such works help document his career and early reputation. They also provide opportunities for collectors priced out of the market for Blake’s drawings and original graphics. Searching the Internet daily can be tiresome but occasionally rewarding.
 
The section of these marketplace reports devoted to Blake’s Circle and Followers is once again threatening to overwhelm the artist/poet himself. Beginning with this sales review, I will no longer list separate plates and book illustrations for Blake’s circle and followers unless executed by the original artist. Exceptions will be made for particularly important or rare works, such as large separate plates designed by Fuseli, discoveries, and plates by artists, such as Basire, of interest principally for their copy engravings. The coverage of Blake and Interesting Blakeana will remain unchanged.
 
The year of all sales and catalogues in the following lists is 2013 unless indicated otherwise. Most reports about auction catalogues are based on the online versions. Coverage of regional auctions is selective. Dates for dealers’ online catalogues are the dates accessed, not the dates of publication. Works offered online by dealers and previously listed in any one of the last three sales reviews are not repeated here. Most of the auction houses add their purchaser’s surcharge to the hammer price in their price lists. These net amounts are given here, following the official price lists. The value-added tax levied against the buyer’s surcharge in Britain is not included. Late 2013 sales will be covered in the 2014 review. I am grateful for help in compiling this review to G. E. Bentley, Jr., Nancy Bialler, David Bindman, Robert Brandeis, Mark Crosby, Harriet Drummond, Mark Griffith-Jones, Gretchen Hause, Richard Lloyd, Nicholas Lott, Constance McPhee, Alan Parker, William Pressly, Lucy Rosenburgh, Joseph Viscomi, Francis Wahlgren, and John Windle. My special thanks go to Alexander Gourlay for his generosity in keeping me abreast of Internet auctions and catalogues and for help with high-resolution imaging and identifying Blake’s handwriting. Once again, John Sullivan’s digital imaging and Sarah Jones’s editorial expertise have been invaluable.

The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, pls. 5-6 printed recto/verso. Sold by private treaty in Nov. by Commonwealth Books, Boston, to John Windle acting for Essick. See illus. 1-2.
 
 
1. The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, pl. 5 (see enlargement), printed in reddish-brown ink with pl. 6 in red ink on the verso (illus. 2). Relief etching with white-line work and blue watercolor in the design above the text, platemark 15.0 x 10.7 cm. Wove paper without watermark, leaf 16.0 x 11.7 cm. Both pls. probably printed c. 1790. Blake also used ink colors very similar to the reddish-brown of pl. 5 for 14 pls. in copy B of The Marriage, also printed c. 1790. Mounted in a window cut in a leaf of wove paper without watermark, 31.2 x 23.8 cm. and numbered “90” (not shown) in pen and brown ink top right. A framing line is inscribed in brown ink on the mount very close to the edges of the window. This is very probably the mount into which the leaf bearing pls. 5 and 6 was inlaid and the mount in turn bound “about 1853” (BB 337) by George A. Smith with the “Order” of the Songs of Innocence and of Experience and many other prints from Blake’s illuminated books. The number top right probably represents the position of this leaf within the album. These impressions were formerly untraced since their sale at auction in 1938; see BB 287, 301, 338 #54, 341 #M1-2. Eight stabholes, cut into by the left edge of the mount, measure from the top hole 4.0, 3.8, 1.9, 2.5, 4.7, 5.4, and 4.15 cm. apart. A second set of 18 much smaller holes is about 3 mm. within the left edge of the mount; these are all about 1.5 cm. apart. The mount inscribed in pencil below the print, “from Marriage of Heaven and Hell page 5”; the verso inscribed in the same position by the same hand “Heaven and Hell page 6.” Essick collection. Click to show more.
 
 
A label associated with these Marriage pls., probably once pasted to the back of a former mat or frame, bears a pen and ink inscription: “Purchased for John J. Slocum / by Dr. Jacob Schwartz / at the [George C.] Smith Sale, Nov. 2, 1938, [#36] / for $45.00., at Park[e] Bernet galleries / J. J. S. attended Sale with his / Aunt Olivia and Uncle Sherman Flint.” The price recorded on this label apparently includes a $5 fee for Schwartz, since the lot sold for $40. Provenance: As in BB to 1938; acquired at the Smith auction by the dealer Jacob Schwartz acting for the American diplomat and James Joyce bibliographer John J. Slocum (1914-97); by inheritance in 1997 to the person who brought the work, framed and double glazed, to Commonwealth Books, Boston, in Oct.; on consignment with Commonwealth Books, Nov. (not priced); sold Nov. to John Windle acting for Essick.
 
A lightly inked outline curves right of the horse in the design above the text and loops just above the final word in line 1 (“theirs”). A similar shadowy line, even more lightly printed, can be seen above and to the left of the falling figure. This is the escarpment of a plateau created by step etching. After an initial etch, Blake covered the design with acid resist, then etched the uncovered areas to a slightly greater depth. The inking ball caught the edge of the plateau and deposited a little ink. The smudged appearance of these lines suggests that Blake attempted to wipe them clean of ink but did not completely succeed. A similar effort may have extended to the areas between the man’s legs and below the horse’s muzzle, leaving behind a slight brown tone. There is no evidence of the edge of a step between the design and the text; the application of acid resist may have extended over both. If so, then only the large blank areas upper right and left would have been exposed to a second treatment with acid. The ink ball would not have been supported by relief surfaces in these portions of the copperplate; it makes sense to etch them more deeply to prevent foul inking. Some ink also adhered to and printed from the etching dike, particularly along the lower left and right margins. Blake may have cleaned most of the ink from the top and bottom etching dikes, although parts of their inner edges can still be seen. The serpent above the 3rd line of text from the end does not show the white-line stippling, deployed to indicate scales, clearly visible in copy B of The Marriage. I suspect that the white-line work was present on the copperplate when this impression was pulled but that it was obscured by heavy inking and printing. This would also appear to be the case with pl. 5 in copy C. The platemark, more prominent than in the vast majority of Blake’s relief etchings, also indicates that this example was printed with greater pressure than usual. The blue coloring used to indicate sky in the design seems unimpressive at first sight, but the tinting on the falling figure was applied with some care, perhaps as an undertone in anticipation of subsequent applications of rose and pink. Blake used such combinations of colors to represent flesh in his watercolors. I hesitate, however, to attribute the washes to either Blake or his wife, Catherine. Click to show less.
 
 
 
  
 
2. The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, pl. 6, printed in red ink with pl. 5 on the recto (illus. 1). Relief etching, probably printed c. 1790. The platemark is 10.1 cm. in width. The edge of the window into which the leaf is inlaid covers the top platemark; BB 68 records a height of 15.1 cm. Text from pl. 5 shows through as a blind embossment on this verso, particularly lower left. Essick collection. See the caption to illus. 1 for further information.
 
The pl. is poorly printed lower left. Joseph Viscomi suggests that this resulted from an unbalanced roller in Blake’s press. Perhaps this impression and its companion on the recto were trial pulls before Blake had properly adjusted his press. Pl. 6 in copy B of The Marriage shows slightly better, but still weak, printing lower left. Neither Viscomi nor I have been able to find a close match for the red ink of this impression among Blake’s other printings of Marriage pls. datable to c. 1790. The color befits the “Memorable Fancy” beginning on this pl.: “As I was walking among the fires of hell, ….”

This impression is in a previously unrecorded 2nd st. When compared to lifetime impressions, such as the well-inked and uncolored example in copy BB, this posthumous impression shows that work with a tool has cut away some of the relief surfaces left of the upper figure’s left upper arm, above his head (thereby eliminating part of his left hand), and along the lower edge of his left leg and foot. Similar work appears on the lower figure’s left upper arm, above and to the left of her head, and on her left upper leg and foot. A relief patch in the upper outline of her back, just below the man’s right knee, has been almost completely cut away. Some of the relief surface just above the lower left margin may also have been eliminated with a tool, although blotchy inking contributes to the white-line effects in this area. I have found this 2nd st. only in other posthumous copies (e.g., copies b and h); it does not appear in late copies printed by Blake, such as Z and AA of 1826. The 2nd st. alterations may have been made by Blake’s wife, Catherine, or Tatham after Blake’s death.

Printed 1832 or later by Frederick Tatham. This impression is reasonably well printed in a grainy ink, but with some foul inking of recessed areas within the cloud of smoke right of the second stanza. Was this style of inking and printing a purposeful attempt to create a smoky effect? A positive answer might be giving too much credit to Tatham. Photo courtesy of Christie’s New York.

This small drawing shows a surprising number of pentimenti. Colinet, the younger shepherd on the left, was originally placed closer to the sheep. He may have been kneeling. The sheep closest to Colinet was sketched further left, his head raised higher. A few lines above the dog suggest foliage, either a tree on a distant hill or branches and leaves descending from the large tree on the left, as in the relief etching of the design. The dog’s head may have been sketched closer to the running shepherd’s right leg. This man’s right arm was first sketched a little lower, his left arm a little higher, and his shepherd’s crook higher and further right. The branch arching above Thenot, the older shepherd on the right, and its leaves above the flock of sheep were originally slightly higher than their bolder execution in black ink. A patch of light gray pigment just below Thenot’s left armpit probably masks some preliminary sketching. Blake then added a few ink lines over the white area to define Thenot’s chest and left upper arm. Thin washes around Colinet’s hands hint at other modifications. The cluster of light brown lines below the running flock may simply be stains similar to the darker brown spots along the design’s lower edge. This drawing is intermediate between Blake’s relief etching of the design and his wood engraving; see Essick, “A Relief Etching of Blake’s Virgil Illustrations,” Blake 25.3 (winter 1991-92): 117-27.
 
All of Blake’s wood engravings illustrate Ambrose Philips’s “imitation” of Virgil’s first eclogue. In this preliminary drawing, as in the wood engraving, Colinet holds his shepherd’s crook in his left hand and panpipes in his right. Thenot leans against the tree on the right and gestures with his right hand toward a third shepherd, Lightfoot, who runs on the background hill followed by his barking dog. Blake is probably responding to a brief speech by Thenot: “See Lightfoot; he shall tend them [the sheep] close; and I / ‘tween whiles, across the plain will glance mine eyes.—” (1: 14 of Thornton’s ed.). Lightfoot seems to be driving the hillside flock rapidly to the right, but the sheep have their heads turned back toward the left. The marks top center would appear to be fragments from a mostly scraped away inscription in brown ink. Based on extensive analysis using high-resolution images captured with a Celestron digital microscope, Alexander Gourlay has determined that the word is “WOLVES.” The lines illustrated in Philips’s text do not refer to any predators, but a slightly later passage, illustrated by another wood engraving, names both the “fox” and “wolf” as potential threats. If “WOLVES” is a title or caption for the design reproduced here, it provides an explanation for the running dog, man, and sheep: all are fleeing wolves. As Butlin points out, Lightfoot’s posture “recalls the messengers in the Job illustration” coming to tell Job and his wife of the destruction of their possessions, including their “sheep” (Job 1.16). Blake first executed the Job design as a watercolor c. 1805-06 (Butlin #550.4).
 
Similar brown-ink fragments of different words, probably including “Colinet” on Butlin #769.2 and possibly “Thenot” on Butlin #769.7, appear top center on several other Virgil drawings; see Blake 31.4 (spring 1998): 124, caption to illus. 9. This ink differs from the gray and black inks Blake used in the drawings, and thus these inscriptions are probably not by him. They may have been written by John Linnell, who acquired the drawings no later than 1839. The sharply slanted terminal “S” in the inscription on this drawing is similar to those in the first line of his manuscript draft of an advertisement for Blake’s Job engravings; see the reproduction in Blake 45.4 (spring 2012): 121. I hesitate to speculate about who attempted to delete the inscriptions or why.

This complex design is discussed in William Blake’s Watercolour Inventions in Illustration of The Grave by Robert Blair, ed. Martin Butlin, essay by Morton D. Paley (Lavenham, Suffolk: William Blake Trust, 2009) 56. As Butlin indicates, “At the top of the right-hand side Blake seems to have included a scene of baptism in its most negative form: an horrific old man clutching a very reluctant child as he dips his hand in a bowl of water held by two young figures.” There would appear to be another parodic version of one of the sacraments—or more precisely a prelude to it—at top left. A young man holds a round object, very probably a ring, in his left hand. He grasps a young woman’s left wrist with his right hand and may be about to slip the ring over one of the extended fingers of her left hand. He looks not at his intended but at the approaching patriarchal figure to the right, who points his left index finger at the couple and raises a dagger in his right hand. Is this the girl’s angry father, threatening violence as a way of halting an impending engagement? The girl’s raised right hand, palm facing right, may be a gesture directed at the old rather than the young man. Her open mouth and general expression indicate alarm. The two women below the pair may be pulling them downward and thereby helping their entry into the church where a wedding ceremony can commence. These may be personifications of the desires of lovers caught between fulfillment and restraint.

This drawing is a preliminary for the more finished watercolor (illus. 9) in the Fitzwilliam Museum. The design illustrates events recounted in Genesis 42. Ten of Joseph’s half-brothers have been sent by their father, Jacob, to Egypt to buy corn. Eight brothers are clearly pictured on the left; a 9th is represented only by a few lines delineating head and hair between the upper and lower figures furthest left. Pharaoh has placed Joseph, seated on the throne-like bench or chair in the center of the design, in charge of preparing for the predicted 7 years of dearth. The brothers do not recognize Joseph, but he knows who they are, accuses them of being spies, and places “them all together into ward three days” (Genesis 42.17). His favorite brother, Benjamin, is not among the group that has come to Egypt. After releasing them from prison, Joseph orders one of the visitors, Simeon, to be taken hostage to enforce his demand that Benjamin will be included during their next trip to Egypt. Simeon half kneels on the right while being bound by an Egyptian servant or guard not referred to in Genesis; the brothers on the left respond with surprise and regret at this harsh treatment, the reasons for which they do not understand. Joseph overhears his brethren discussing their guilt over selling him into bondage and “he turned himself about from them, and wept” (Genesis 42.24). Blake pictures this moment in the narrative. Joseph’s turning away from his brothers indicates his complex psychological state, a contradictory mixture of familial attachment, anger at past crimes against him, and awareness of his present powers to punish or forgive. The rhythm of head, eye, and hand positions contributes substantially to the interplay of emotions among the figures expressed by Blake’s design. The prominence of eyes and hands in Blake’s art of the 1780s may be due in part to the necessity for an engraver to concentrate on their coordination.
 
Butlin notes that there are “a number of pentimenti” in this drawing. The head and upper body of the figure far right were first drawn higher and a little further to the right; the head and shoulder of the brother top left were originally sketched higher in the design. A few very light pencil lines left of Joseph’s upper body suggest that he was first sketched in a more upright posture. Click to show less.

Blake exhibited this work and its 2 companions, Joseph’s Brethren Bowing before Him and Joseph Making Himself Known to His Brethren (Butlin #155, 157), at the Royal Academy in 1785. At least one strand of Old Testament narrative treats Jacob’s 12 sons as the progenitors of the 12 tribes of Israel (see 1 Kings 18.31). Thus, the story of Joseph and his brethren can be read as a harbinger of the struggles of the Israelites to be one nation in spite of quarrels among their tribes. Blake may have seen the story as a paradigmatic example of the eternal conflicts between the forces of unification and fragmentation that figure so prominently in his writings. The restoration of psychic and communal harmony through the forgiveness of sin, an important motif in Blake’s later work, is foreshadowed by the final episode of the Joseph story in Genesis 45, illustrated by Blake’s concluding design. For an interesting biographical interpretation of the 3 Joseph designs, see David Bindman, Blake as an Artist (Oxford: Phaidon, 1977) 34-35. Butlin #156 lists the major differences between the preliminary drawing (illus. 8) and this finished watercolor, but does not note the addition of 5 or 6 serpents in the elaborated background of the latter. The 4 most prominent snakes coil around columns and foliage to emblemize the intertwined and potentially harmful family relationships unfolding in the foreground. For further discussion, see Christopher Heppner, Reading Blake’s Designs (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1995) 12-21, 89-92.

Christie’s detailed auction cat. entry of 31 Jan., #147, notes an “indistinct inscription in the hand of John Varley ‘Hotspur…’ and further indistinct inscriptions (recto) and with indistinct inscription in the hand of John Varley ‘it is allways [sic] to keep yourself collected’ (verso). … The reference to Hotspur and his [Varley’s] need to keep himself ‘collected’ may refer to a lost drawing on the missing facing page” of the sketchbook. The cat. also provides a description of the design: It is difficult to make out the subject of the present example. What appears to be an angel raises his arms, behind which two wings can be seen, unless indeed they are rising flames or emanations of divine inspiration. The other figure seems to have just approached him with arm outstretched as if to indicate from whence he has come; his head is silhouetted against what seems to be a large halo. Alternatively, this second figure could be female. Behind runs a line of regularly shaped hills or perhaps pyramids. Might the figure on the left, not the one on the right, be female? Note the rounded breasts. The supposed halo is offset to the right; it could be the rising or setting sun. Curving horizontal lines on the right suggest more hills or mountains, irregularly rather than “regularly” shaped. Three horizontal lines above the peaks on the left may be clouds. I am unable to decipher the two vertical lines, with a looping line at their base, left of the leftmost peak. Clusters of lines left of the figures’ feet and between their feet may be the rudimentary beginnings of foreground motifs. The raised arms of the figure on the left recall Satan in several versions of Blake’s illus. of the fallen angel calling up his legions in Paradise Lost (see Butlin #529.1, 536.1, possibly 591), but other motifs make such an identification questionable. The precise subject of the design has not yet been determined.
 
The condition report provided by Christie’s mentions several problems, including the extensive but light brown staining evident in a color reproduction, “three small areas of old restoration towards the upper edge of the sheet,” some “fading to the pencilwork,” and a water stain lower left. Many of the lines also look rubbed; note particularly the cluster of graphite fragments below the figures’ feet.  The brown stains were probably caused by the “acidic mount” to which the drawing has been “taped along the upper edge.” When removed from the sketchbook and sold at CL, 15 June 1971, #157, the leaf was not mounted. Thus, one of its subsequent owners taped it to the harmful mount. Let that be a warning to us all about the care and keeping of works of art. Click to show less.

11. The Waking of Leonora, Design for the Tailpiece for Bürger’s “Leonora.” Watercolor, 6.7 x 12.9 cm. on leaf of wove paper 8.2 x 14.0 cm., datable to c. 1796. See illus. 12 for the inscription lower right. Butlin #338 records the first owner of the watercolor as “Mrs. Dew-Smith by 1912.” Christie’s cat. of 9 April, #65, adds to this provenance the sensible speculation that the drawing passed to her (I suspect by inheritance) from her husband, Albert George Dew-Smith (1848-1903). He owned several works by Blake, including America copy B, acquired in 1874. For information on A. G. Dew-Smith, see Joseph Viscomi, “Two Fake Blakes Revisited; One Dew-Smith Revealed,” Blake in Our Time: Essays in Honour of G. E. Bentley Jr, ed. Karen Mulhallen (Toronto: U of Toronto P, 2010) 35-78.

12. Top: inscriptions lower right on The Waking of Leonora (illus. 11). Area shown approximately 0.5 x 2.6 cm.
 
Bottom: The same, manipulated in Adobe Photoshop to increase the visibility of the inscription right of “del” (see enlargement).
 
Blake first wrote an inscription lower right, “Blake del and sc.,” very lightly in pencil. He appears to have written some version of “and sc.” twice, one above the other. The lower “and sc.” is on roughly the same line as “Blake del” in pencil and thus was probably written along with the first part of the inscription. The characters may have been poorly formed; this would explain the need for writing a more legible version above. The wording of the pencil inscription names Blake as both the delineator (“del,” an abbreviation for “delineavit”) and the engraver (“sc.,” an abbreviation of “sculpsit”) of the design. Blake then wrote “Blake del__” over his pencil inscription in a dark black medium, possibly the same black watercolor or ink used to outline motifs in the design. The letters of “Blake” are offset to the left, and the dash or underscore following “del” runs through the lower “and sc.” inscription. The pencil version indicates that Blake believed that he would be employed to engrave this illus., and probably the two others he designed, for J. T. Stanley’s translation of Bürger’s poem. Having learned that someone else would engrave the illus., he changed the wording to take credit for the design but not its execution as a print. Engravers were generally paid more for their copy work than the original artists of book illus., and thus these layered inscriptions indicate what may have been a financial disappointment for Blake. He was similarly treated in 1805, when R. H. Cromek failed to hire him to engrave the designs for Robert Blair’s The Grave. Photo courtesy of Christie’s New York.


  
 
13. Sketch for “The Waking of Leonora” (see enlargement). Pencil, 9.5 x 13.5 cm., leaf of wove paper 14.9 x 23.5 cm., inscribed in pen and ink lower right “Drawn by William / Blake. / vouched by Fred.k Tatham.” Butlin #339. A preliminary drawing for the watercolor (illus. 11). Photo courtesy of the Keynes Collection, Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.
 
The three principal figures are basically the same as in the watercolor and subsequent engraving (illus. 14), but this sketch includes cloudborne figures not retained in the 2 later versions. Five figures descend in an arc above Leonora’s head. Four have their arms, or possibly trumpets, extended toward her. These may be “sweet spirits” awakening her (p. 15 of Stanley’s translation of Leonora; see also the poem’s concluding stanza, quoted in the caption to illus. 14). At least 5(?) figures hover above Leonora’s mother on the left. They may represent the “airy rabble” of “spectres” haunting Leonora’s nightmare (p. 10). Another figure to the right descends diagonally toward the group of 5 with at least one arm extended toward them. There may be flames, or several alternative positions for a sword, rising from this figure’s extended hand. This may be a benign presence, chasing away the creatures of Leonora’s frightening dream. I am not able to decipher the cluster of forms sketched immediately above the head of Leonora’s mother on the left; they may be related in some vague way to the horse ridden by Leonora in her nightmare ride to the land of the dead.


  
 
14. Tailpiece, p. 16, to Gottfried Augustus Bürger, Leonora, translated and altered by J. T. Stanley, 1796.

Blake’s design illustrates the final stanza of Stanley’s translation, printed just above this tailpiece on p. 16: “Wake, Leonora!—wake to Love! “For thee, his choicest wreath he wove;” Death vainly aim’d his Dart. The Past was all a dream; she woke— He lives;—’twas William’s self who spoke, And clasp’d her to his Heart. The text does not indicate the presence of Leonora’s mother, pictured on the left, in this concluding scene. Blake represents her as one of his figures of fallen nature, a “Mother of my Mortal part” (“To Tirzah,” E 30), or as a personification of “Aged Ignorance” (For Children: The Gates of Paradise, E 32; see also Europe, E 64). A particularly close visual and thematic parallel is the seated woman in the illus. to the 1797 ed. of Young’s Night Thoughts, p. 35 (BB pl. 20). In Stanley’s version of Bürger’s poem, the mother utters conventional pieties in her attempt to assuage her daughter’s grief over the supposed death of Leonora’s fiancé, William, but also proposes that he may still be alive and has found another lover. The mother also admonishes her daughter for questioning God. Perhaps Blake associated such sentiments with the established church and its restrictive moral codes. The mother’s features are more refined, and her expression less stupefied, in Perry’s engraving than in Blake’s drawing. 
 
The passage illustrated is Stanley’s addition to Bürger’s original, which ends with Leonora dead and William still absent. In a letter of 15 April 1796 to the book’s publisher, William Miller, quoted in the “Advertisement” in the book, Stanley complains that the poem might be “calculated … to injure the cause of Religion and Morality” (vi). “Such reflections have tempted me to make the alterations I have alluded to” (vii). In his “Preface,” Miller further explains that “the Poem will be found, in many respects, to have been altered from the original; but more particularly towards the conclusion, where the translator thinking the moral not sufficiently explained, has added several lines” (x). Miller then offers a more “literal” translation of Bürger’s final 8 lines, ending with the following address to Leonora: Though rack’d with sorrow, be resign’d, Thy earthly course is at an end, May God unto thy Soul be kind. (x) By replacing this with a happy ending, Stanley vindicates the mother’s beliefs in the goodness of God and the power of prayer. The theological and ethical perspectives shared by the translator and the publisher have much in common with Leonora’s mother. Is Blake’s characterization of her also a critique of them?

“George Cumberland’s Card.” John Windle, March online cat., printed in black ink on “thick card … trimmed very close to the image at the left and right edges, once pasted down and thus with traces of mounting on the verso and pencil notes from an earlier collector” ($20,000). The impression offered at CSK, 5 Dec. 2012, #192, leaf 4.1 x 8.1 cm. (not sold; acquired by Windle after the auction). The verso notes would appear to include the awkward EJSW monogram of Edward J. Shaw of Walsall, active as a Blake collector c. 1890-1925. BHL, 16 July, #27, printed in black ink on laid paper, SP untraced impression 7, illus. (£2500).

BL, 30 May, #108, complete set, 1874 printing on laid India, curiously “loose in a custom made hinged wooden box with glazed viewing panel to front cover,” illus. (not sold; estimate £10,000-15,000); same copy, 11 July, #215, illus. (not sold; estimate £5000-7500). Lyon and Turnbull auction, Edinburgh, 20 July, #210, 3 pls. only: pls. numbered 9 and 12, published “Proof” impressions on laid India, pl. numbered 14, 1874 printing on laid India, illus. (“£1300” but perhaps bought in); same group, 4 Oct., #74, illus. (£1000). SL, 17 Sept., #1, complete set, published “Proof” impressions on laid India, full morocco by Riviere and Son, illus. (£31,250). CNY, 29 Oct., #792, from the collection of Arthur and Charlotte Vershbow, the property of Ann Vershbow, complete set, published “Proof” impressions on “French paper” (BB 519), scattered minor foxing, original buff boards worn with cover label, illus. ($68,750; estimate $30,000-50,000). CL, 20 Nov., #345, pl. numbered 18 only, 1874 printing on laid India, margins foxed, from the “collection of the late Mrs T.S. Eliot,” illus. (£500).

“Mrs Q,” after Villiers, 1820. Adam Partridge auction, Macclesfield, Cheshire, 31 Jan., #545, with a “bill of sale for £35 dated 18th December 1944 from Chas. J. Sawyer Ltd,” framed, illus. (£120). The figure’s auburn hair suggests a 2nd st. impression from Blake’s original copperplate rather than the lithographic facsimile of 1906 with darker brunette hair. Possibly the impression from the W. E. Moss collection sold at auction in 1937, lot 201, with “top and side margins cut away,” as in this impression, and offered in a Sawyer cat. of the same year for £25—see SP 196, untraced impression 19. See also the 1906 facsimile under Interesting Blakeana, below.
  
“Zephyrus and Flora,” after Stothard, 1784. EB, Dec. 2012, lightly stained, matted and framed, illus. (acquired by Essick at the “buy it now” price of £14.95). A previously unrecorded impression printed in dark brown ink on laid paper with an illegible watermark probably composed of letters. Leaf 18.0 x 21.0 cm. trimmed to an oval close to the design, only the signatures retained among the inscriptions. The st. of this impression cannot be determined beyond doubt because the only differences between the 2 sts. appear in the inscribed title. The paper, however, suggests that this is a 1st st.; the 3 recorded impressions of that st. are on laid paper, whereas the 3 recorded impressions of the 2nd st. are on wove. The only other traced impression in dark brown ink (Keynes collection, Fitzwilliam Museum) is printed in that color plus blue and reddish brown. 
 
The British vendor on EB, “Pat” of “4 changinghands,” tells me that she acquired this impression in a mixed lot of prints at an auction house (I suspect Bamfords) in Derby, but has no further provenance information. Only the 3rd impression I’ve ever seen on the market; the others were sold in 1976 (2nd st., black ink, from the collection of Geoffrey Keynes, SP impression 2C) and 1999 (1st st., sanguine ink; see Blake 33.4 [spring 2000]: 109).
 
Stothard’s “Zephyrus and Flora” may have influenced Blake’s depiction of the 2 figures hovering near flowers on the title page to The Book of Thel. If so, then Blake’s male may be the wind attempting to embrace (and pollinate?) the female personification of the flower from which she emerges.
  
Letterpress Books with Engravings by and after Blake, Including Prints Extracted from Such Books
 
Allen, Roman History, 1798. EB, April, lacking pl. 1, scattered foxing on pls., modern quarter calf, illus. (offered at the “buy it now” price of £300).
  
Ariosto, Orlando furioso. Justin Croft/Simon Beattie, Feb. cat. of “English Verse 1751-1800 Part I: A-G,” #30, 1785 ed., 5 vols., pls. foxed and browned, contemporary calf, illus. (£300). Havercroft Books, June online cat., 1783 ed., 5 vols., some browning, some pls. (including Blake’s) loose, contemporary calf worn, the same copy offered by Hava Books for £350, April 2012 online cat. (£385). Poor Richard’s Books, June online cat., 1783 ed., 5 vols., later calf, vol. 5 “fragile” (£350). John Taylor Books, June online cat., 1783 ed., 5 vols., contemporary half calf worn, bindings illus. (£300). Old Saratoga Books, June online cat., 1799 ed., 5 vols., some leaves “grubby,” contemporary calf very worn, bindings illus. ($350). Caliban Books, June online cat., 1785 ed., 5 vols., scattered foxing, contemporary calf worn ($150). EB, July-Aug., 1799 ed., vol. 3 only with Blake’s pl., stained, no description of binding other than “pieces of covering missing,” illus. (no bids on a required minimum bid of £9.99).
  
Bible. Royal Universal Family Bible, 1780. Victoria Bookshop, Oct. online cat., “vol 1” only (Old Testament) and thus presumably with Blake’s pl. 1 (of 5), “boards detached” (£123.30). 
  
Blair, The Grave, 1813 quarto, hand-colored copy. CNY, 29 Oct., #789, from the collection of Arthur and Charlotte Vershbow, the frontispiece portrait of Blake not colored, “date defaced” (so that this copy could be taken for the 1808 ed.?), 19th-century “niger” by the “Hempstead Bindery,” rebacked, top edges gilt, “dampstaining at the foot,” illus. ($93,750; estimate $60,000-80,000). The auction cat. states that this is “possibly the master copy, colored by Blake,” and that “according to Martin Butlin, the present copy appears to have been colored by Blake himself.” BBS 199 lists this copy as an 1808 quarto and states that the coloring is “apparently by Blake.” John Windle and I suspect that the hand coloring is c. 1850 or later.Windle inspected the original in early 2013. I studied the original in 1980 and good-quality digital images of all pls. in Nov. 2013. The heavy coloring of flames and the tinting of angels’ wings in multiple pastel hues seem particularly uncharacteristic of Blake.
 
The auction cat. points out that the Vershbows acquired this copy from “Scopazzi, 1971.” Windle tells me that the San Francisco dealer John Scopazzi (1910-87) specialized in acquiring uncolored maps and prints and having them professionally colored in period styles. I doubt that this copy of The Grave was colored by Scopazzi, but such a source always raises suspicions. The auction cat. also refers to “the Keynes copy of the 1813 edition” hand colored, but I have not been able to find any record of such a copy, nor do I recall seeing such a work in Sir Geoffrey’s collection. A hand-colored copy of the 1808 quarto ed. is in the Huntington Library, call no. 54049. Its tinting is more skillful, restrained, and convincing than the Vershbow copy. The palette and placement of colors in the Huntington volume share some characteristics with hand-colored copies of Young’s Night Thoughts, but I hesitate to ascribe the tinting to Blake or his wife, Catherine.
  
Blair, The Grave, uncolored copies. EB, Jan., pl. 7 only, 1813 imprint, illus. (£7.99); Jan.-Feb., “1813” (actually 1870) folio, publisher’s cloth rebacked, illus.

Stern, June online cat., “1813,” probably the quarto, contemporary half morocco worn ($1750). Contact Editions, June online cat., “1813” (but probably the 1870 folio), damp staining, “blind decorated black cloth” restored ($1500). Bonhams auction, New York, 25 June, #3217, 1808 quarto, inscription by James Neagle (probably the engraver, 1765-1822) dated 22 Feb. 1816, “some marginal damp-stains,” uncut in original boards worn and rebacked with cloth tape, “paper label upper cover,” quarter morocco slipcase, illus. (not sold; estimate $2000-3000).

CNY, 29 Oct., #788, 1808 folio, from the collection of Arthur and Charlotte Vershbow, occasional foxing, pls. 8 and 9 in the 2nd published st. as in the 1808 quarto, all other pls. in the 1st published st., later morocco, illus.

Celsus Books, Oct. online cat., 1808 quarto, light foxing to margins, contemporary calf worn and rebacked, illus. (£1995). For the proof of pl. 4, see illus. 15.
  
 
15. Luigi Schiavonetti after Blake, “The Counsellor, King, Warrior, Mother and Child in the Tomb,” pl. 4 for Robert Blair, The Grave, 1808 (see enlargement). Previously unrecorded 1st prepublication proof st. of this etching/engraving. Essick collection. Image 14.0 x 22.8 cm. on leaf of laid paper 14.6 x 23.4 cm., 0.22 mm. thick. No watermark and no clearly visible chain lines in spite of prominent wire lines. The 1st published st., appearing in the 1808 folio issue of The Grave, is on a very similar laid paper—but measurably thicker at 0.30 mm.
 
The design in the impression reproduced here lacks a number of hatching strokes present in all later sts. The most noticeable absences appear on the counsellor’s right arm above and below the elbow, the left (upper) extension of his long mustache, and both legs below the knees, particularly where his gown or shroud gathers at his ankles. The pillow below and left of his head, the unrolled portion of the scroll below and to the right of his right hand, and the pillow below the king’s head lack diagonal hatching patterns found in all later sts. Fine horizontal lines have been added to the warrior’s thighs, the mother’s breasts, and the right side of the child’s chest in the next recorded st. Oddly, a small patch of hatching on the central extension of the counsellor’s beard, about 2.5 cm. right of his mouth, does not appear in later sts. These 4 lines were probably burnished off the pl. The flame extending from the oil lamp, upper center, has been brightened and made more prominent in the next st. by burnishing away a few interior lines and adding a stronger outline on its left side.
 
The leaf on which this proof is printed extends 2.0 mm. below the lower margin of the design. The upper half of the signatures found in the 1st published st. would appear if they had been present. Since the next known st. is a proof on Whatman wove paper with the design completed but before all letters (Essick collection), it seems probable that the copperplate from which the proof reproduced here was printed also lacked all letters.

Earle, Practical Observations on the Operation for the Stone, 1793, with Appendix to a Treatise on the Operation for the Stone, 1796.  Uncommon Books, May online cat., pls. 1-2 foxed, CB pl. 3 (mentioned in BB #451 but not numbered) in the 1st st., published as part of the Appendix but misbound upside-down facing p. 80 in the 1793 text, bound with Earle, A Treatise on the Hydrocele, 1796, 19th-century boards, spine repaired with cloth tape ($288 to Essick). The only copy of Earle’s Appendix, and the only impression of CB pl. 3, I’ve ever seen on the market. BB states that the attribution of this 3rd pl. to Blake “seems far from conclusive” (550). CB 61 accepts it as Blake’s work, an attribution 1st made in Geoffrey Keynes, “William Blake and Bart’s,” Blake 7.1 (summer 1973): 9-10. The lettering in the scratched inscriptions added to the 2nd st. of CB pl. 3 is crucial in establishing the attribution. In BBS 211, Bentley states that he is “now willing to include the plate as Blake’s, though balking at their [Keynes’s and Essick’s] certainty.” See also Leslie F. Chard, II, “Two ‘New’ Blake Engravings: Blake, James Earle, and the Surgeon’s Art,” Blake Studies 6.2 (1975): 153-65.

Interesting Blakeana
 
Blake’s Cottage, 1 Blake’s Road, Felpham, West Sussex. Jackson-Stops, June online cat., #52661, a 17th-century brick and flint cottage, listed grade II*, Blake’s residence Sept. 1800 to fall 1803, on the market for the 1st time since 1928, many illus. including a detailed floor plan (guide price £650,000). According to the Blake Society, London, e-mail of 5 Sept., a sale was pending at £600,000 to a private buyer.
  
William Locke, Jr. (1767-1847), an album of 44 pencil, pen and ink, and chalk drawings. BHL, 10 April, #235, some signed and dated between 1780 and 1787, with 3 framed landscape drawings, “by descent through the family of William Gilpin,” illus. (£6250; estimate £2000-3000). The album was probably acquired by Rafael Valls Gallery, London, which held “An Exhibition of Drawings by William Lock the Younger,” 4-14 Dec. Locke (or Lock) was a student of Fuseli’s, whose influence is evident in these studies. Locke is listed as a subscriber to R. H. Cromek’s ed. of Robert Blair’s The Grave with Blake’s designs in the 1st and 2nd prospectuses (both Nov. 1805) and in 2 of the subsequent advertisements for the book (BR[2] 210, 214, 226).
  
Novelist’s Magazine, vol. 9, 1782, BB pl. 1 for “Sentimental Journey,” Blake after Stothard. EB, Feb., printed in dark brown, with signatures but lacking all other letters, with some lines removed (in comparison to the proof before all letters in the British Museum) in the lower frame of the cartouche below the central design, illus. (acquired at the “buy it now” price of $200 by a gullible Essick). Although offered as an original impression from Blake’s pl., this turned out to be a reproduction, probably a photo-etching or zincograph. The platemark was altered slightly from 17.4 x 11.2 cm. to 16.9 x 11.0 cm., but the design, including the elaborate frame, was reduced considerably from 15.6 x 10.5 cm. in original impressions to 12.6 x 8.6 cm. The paper of this reproduction is a type of hard wove sometimes called “Japan vellum” or “faux vellum” and not known to have been available in England until the second half of the 19th century.
  
The Theatrical Remembrancer, 1788. Elaine Beardsell, Aug. online cat., foxed, recent quarter morocco, illus. (£65). The Bookshop, Chapel Hill, Aug. online cat., with Barker’s Complete List of Plays, 1803, extensively annotated in pen and ink in an early hand, 2 vols. in original boards worn with spines amateurishly repaired with cloth tape ($175). BB #522A (1788 ed.) and C (1803 ed.). The Theatrical Remembrancer would appear to be a reissue of Egerton’s Theatrical Remembrancer, also 1788. The title page, leaf [a1], in the reissue is probably a cancellans. All 3 titles noted here list Blake’s “King Edward the Third” from Poetical Sketches. The issue with “Egerton’s” as the 1st word in the title (not in BB or BBS) is the earliest published bibliography to include a work by Blake. For further comments see the next entry, below.
  
Barker’s Continuation of Egerton’s Theatrical Remembrancer, 1801. Centerbridge Books, April online cat., scattered foxing, later cloth, illus. ($150). Lists Blake’s “King Edward the Third” from Poetical Sketches. BB #522B points out that the drama is wrongly attributed to “Murdock” in this 1801 ed., a mistake resulting from “a conflation from the 1788 Theatrical Remembrancer, where the entry after Blake’s ‘King Edward the Third’ is John Murdock [sic], Double Disguise, 12 mo, 1783.” The compiler of the 1801 ed. also made a spelling error, for the 1788 ed. (see above) accurately records the author of Double Disguise as “John Murdoch” (258). The errors in attribution and spelling are repeated in Barker’s Complete List of Plays, 1803 (see below), but authorship is returned to “Blake” in The Drama Recorded; or, Barker’s List of Plays, 1814 (see below).
  
Barker’s Complete List of Plays, 1803. BB #522C. James Cummins, Aug. online cat., quarter calf ($300). For another copy, see The Theatrical Remembrancer, 1788, above, and for comments see the entry immediately above.

Proofs, 7s.6d.” (p. 65). The pl. is also listed without price in the section of the cat. titled “BOYDELL’S SMALL SHAKSPEARE” (p. 159) and in the subject index, p. 204. All 3 listings name “Blake” as the engraver. “Boydell’s Small Plates” for Shakespeare, presumably a version of BB #437 including Blake’s pl., is offered in the section on “BOOKS AND BOOKS OF PRINTS,” £6.6s. for “modern impressions, half-bound,” and £8.8s. for “very old impressions, in sheets” (p. 188). The cat. also includes pls. after designs by Barry, Flaxman, Fuseli, Romney, and Stothard, and engravings by Parker and Linnell.

Allgemeine Familien Zeitung, no. 36, 1873. EB, Feb., illus. (offered at the “buy it now” prices of €24.80 unframed and €44.60 framed or “best offer”). The front page includes a wood engraving, signed “F. Bocourt” lower left and “L. Chapon” lower right, reproducing Schiavonetti’s engraving of Blake’s “Death’s Door” (reversed) from Blair’s The Grave. This is the same wood engraving by Léon Louis Chapon (1836-1918) published in M. W. Bürger, Histoire des peintres de toutes les écoles: école anglaise, 1863 (BB #1317, indicating that “Bürger” is a pseudonym for J. Thore [that is, Thoré]). The design may have been traced from Schiavonetti’s engraving or drawn on the block by Bocourt (probably Marie Firmin Bocourt, 1819-1904) and cut in the wood by Chapon.

(not sold; estimate £700-1000). The CL cat. entry initially offered these as originals, but a “saleroom notice” posted on the CL web site by 13 Sept. indicated that they are the 1906 facsimiles. Original impressions of “Mrs Q” have a platemark of 35.2 x 24.9 cm. Cheffins auction, Cambridge, 14 Nov., #385, “heavy laid paper,” stained, with the companion print, both elaborately framed, illus. (£300; estimate £70-100). Although offered by Cheffins as an original impression, this is very probably the 1906 facsimile. I have never seen an original on laid paper, but an example of the facsimile in my collection is on heavy laid paper.

“A Grecian Harvest Home,” etching. Galerie Bassenge auction, Berlin, 28 Nov., #5335, 4th (final) st., illus. (€14,000; estimate €1800-2400). I am amazed at the prices that Barry’s prints have been fetching at auction; see “Job Reproved by His Friends” in Blake 46.4 (spring 2013).

(£6000; estimate £8000-12,000). This portfolio includes original impressions of 2 of Calvert’s 3 intaglio engravings, all 7 of his wood engravings, and his 2 lithographs. Another source for the 2 intaglio engravings and 6 of the wood engravings, A Memoir of Edward Calvert Artist by His Third Son, 1893, does not include original impressions of the lithographs.
 
CUMBERLAND, GEORGE
 
Cumberland, Lewina the Maid of Snowdon, bound with Cumberland, A Poem on the Landscapes of Great-Britain, both 1793. Justin Croft/Simon Beattie, Feb. cat. of “English Verse 1751-1800 Part I: A-G,” #189, modern quarter calf, illus. (£1800). This cat. ascribes all the pls. in both works to Cumberland, as their title pages indicate, but a note by George Cumberland, Jr., accompanying an impression in my collection of the tailpiece to Lewina, states that it was designed “Jointly with Thos Stothard R. A.” For other notes attributing this pl. to both men, see G. E. Bentley, Jr., A Bibliography of George Cumberland (1754-1848) (New York: Garland Publishing, 1975) 7n1.
 
FLAXMAN, JOHN
 
See also Flaxman under Letterpress Books with Engravings by and after Blake, above.
 
A group of 18 drawings, including 1 by Flaxman. SL, 5 July, #379, the largest drawing 25.7 x 39.4 cm., the Flaxman illus. (£2875). Flaxman’s pencil, pen and ink, and monochrome wash drawing (size not indicated) pictures a battle scene or its aftermath. The central male is winged and wears a helmet adorned with a serpent. David Bindman suggests that the subject may be taken from the Book of Enoch. If so, the winged figure could be the angel Gabriel, sent by “the Lord” to “destroy the children of fornication, the offspring of the Watchers, from among men; bring them forth, and excite them one against another. Let them perish by mutual slaughter; …” (The Book of Enoch, trans. Richard Laurence [Oxford: Oxford UP, 1821] 10.13).
  
Amphion and Zethus Delivering Their Mother Antiope from the Fury of Dirce and Lycus. Pencil, pen and ink, wash, 16.1 x 29.2 cm., signed “Flaxman, Roma, 1789.” Lowell Libson, Jan. cat. of “British Paintings and Works on Paper,” pp. 41-[43], illus. (not priced).
  
Ballet. Pencil, pen and ink, 9.0 x 10.8 cm., title inscribed in pencil lower right. Roseberys auction, West Norwood, London, 11 June, #704, attributed to “circle of John Flaxman,” illus. (£160); AH, Nov. online cat. 431, #20, firmly attributed to Flaxman, illus. (£475). I agree with Abbott and Holder’s attribution to Flaxman.
  
The Braschi Venus. Pencil and wash, 74.3 x 51.1 cm., datable to 1811. Lowell Libson, Jan. cat. of “British Paintings and Works on Paper,” pp. 38-40, illus. (not priced). Reported on Libson’s web site in Sept. to have been sold to “the Royal Academy of Arts, London.” A lithograph of the design by G. Childs, titled “Venus of Cindos—Praxiteles,” was published as pl. 22 in Flaxman, Lectures on Sculpture, 1829.
  
Design for the Tomb of Mary Ann Bosanquet. Pencil, 11.4 x 18.4 cm., datable to 1819-20. Canterbury auction, Canterbury, 16 April, #544, misidentified as a design for the tomb of “William Basanguet” and wrongly dated to “circa 1813,” foxed and stained, framed, illus. (£480). For a model of the tomb, see Margaret Whinney and Rupert Gunnis, The Collection of Models by John Flaxman R. A. at University College London (London: Athlone P, 1967) 29 #40 and pl. 3a.
  
Italian Woman with a Child. Monochrome wash, 13.5 x 11.8 cm. Grisebach auction, Berlin, 27 Nov., #100, illus. (not sold; estimate €9000-12,000). Previously offered Heim Gallery/Christopher Powney, spring 1976 “John Flaxman” cat., #58, illus. (£240).
  
John Flaxman and His Wife. A pair of Wedgwood circular portrait plaques, 14.0 cm. diameter, profiles on a pale blue ground. Woolley and Wallis auction, Salisbury, 30 April, #322, dated to “late 18th/early 19th century,” framed, illus. (£300). I suspect that these may be a good deal later than the date suggested by the auctioneer.
  
“Maternal Tenderness”: Memorial to Lady Fitzharris. Plaster cast, 68.0 cm. high, inscribed “Published as the act directs May[?] By Mr Flaxman and Mr Denman Buckingham Street Fitzroy Square,” datable to 1816. Lowell Libson, March online cat., from the Tulk family collection, illus. (price on request). Only 1 other cast is recorded, now in Sir John Soane’s Museum, London. Sold by Sept. to the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh.
  
Two Classical Figures Riding a Ram. Pen and ink, gray wash, 20.3 x 30.5 cm., datable to c. 1788. EB, Jan., inscribed “Flaxman—” on the damaged mount, illus. (£320). The subject is almost certainly the ram with the golden fleece carrying Phrixus (or Phrixos or Phryxus) and his sister Helle over the waves from Thebes to Colchis (see the Bibliotheca of Pseudo-Apollodorus, book 1, and Ovid’s Fasti, book 3). Helle never made it; she fell into a part of the sea subsequently called the Hellespont. David Bindman tells me that the design derives in part from a Roman mosaic Flaxman saw in Naples in 1788 and may be connected with a relief sculpture he tried to sell to the Earl of Bristol.
  
Young, Pensive Maiden with an Oil Lamp. Pen and ink, wash, 23.7 x 14.8 cm. Galerie Bassenge auction, Berlin, 31 May, #6423A, dated to c. 1790, illus. (€2800; estimate €600).

(£4000; estimate £1000-1500).

Oil, 86.6 x 65.1 cm., inscribed on the stretcher “Given by Henry Fuseli Esq. to Lady Georgina North it being his first painting.” CL, 4 Dec., #178, illus. (£140,500; estimate £30,000-50,000).

Tickets for admission to Royal Academy lectures signed by Fuseli. See the ticket signed by Flaxman, above.
  
“The Night Mare,” engraved in stipple by “A. Zaffonato” and published by Suntach, 1795. EB, May, trimmed just outside the platemark, marginal foxing, illus. (€369). As the vendor on EB indicates, the engraver was the Italian Alessandro Zaffonato, born c. 1730 and active until c. 1795. For illus., see Blake 41.4 (spring 2008): 156. Speculations in the caption to the 2008 illus. that the engraver’s name was a punning pseudonym are wrong.
  
“Queen Katherine’s Dream,” engraved in stipple by Francesco Bartolozzi, 1788. EB, March, image showing wear, imprint trimmed off, light marginal stains, illus. (no bids on a required minimum bid of €52).
  
A Catalogue of the Small and Very Select Classical Library of the Late Henry Fuseli, SL, 22-25 July 1825. Doyle auction, New York, 25 Nov., #313, with 2 engraved portraits of Fuseli and a “manuscript account of Fuseli by the writer of Spanish travelogues Richard Ford [and] 1945 ownership signature of Ruthven Todd,” with 5 other sale cats., boards detached, illus. ($875).
 
LINNELL, JOHN (excluding later portraits)

Palmer April 1923 / Shorham [sic] Period.” SL, 4 July, #204, with “a pencil study of a young boy seen through an open door, and other figures,” illus. (not sold; estimate £20,000-30,000).

The Cow Yard. Oil, 29.0 x 35.0 cm., signed. Tayler and Fletcher auction, Cheltenham, 20 June, #267, illus. (not sold; estimate £3000-4000). I suspect that this is a copy by someone other than Linnell of the much finer version, signed and dated 1831, in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, accession no. FA.134[O].
  
The Eel Pie House, Twickenham. Watercolor, 8.9 x 14.6 cm., signed and dated 1861. CSK, 5 Dec., #126, illus., with Tending Sheep, watercolor, 10.4 x 15.8 cm., signed and dated 1863 (not sold; estimate £800-1200).

Portrait of Thomas Hill. Oil, 33.0 x 25.4 cm., signed and dated 1831. EB, Jan., illus. ($1703.98). This is probably the portrait of Hill exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1832, #57. Linnell’s preliminary chalk drawing of Hill’s head and shoulders was sold CL, 10 July 1990, #29, illus. (£264).

The Franciscan Monk Asking Charity of Yorick, an illus. to Sterne, Sentimental Journey. Monochrome wash, 11.4 x 7.6 cm., datable to c. 1782. EB, Oct., wrongly said to have been engraved by Birrell and published in Harding’s ed. of Sentimental Journey, 1792, illus. (£149.95). James Heath’s engraving of the design was published in the Novelist’s Magazine, vol. 9 (London: Harrison, 1782), facing p. 5.
  
On the Way to Market, an Illustration to Oliver Goldsmith’s “The Deserted Village.” Watercolor, 12.6 x 9.0 cm. Lots Road auction, Chelsea, 10 March, #487, framed, illus.

(offered at the “buy it now” price of £1000 or “best offer” but quickly withdrawn); High Road auction, Chiswick, 9 April, #75, illus. (£300). The design was engraved by John Romney and published by Suttaby in an 1818 ed. of The Poetical Works of Oliver Goldsmith (Coxhead 118, describing the pl. but not identifying the book). Stothard’s oil painting of the same scene, but with a horizontal format and additional figures on the right, was offered SL, 23 Nov. 2006, #70, illus. (not sold; estimate £3000-4000).

Saul and the Witch of Endor. Oil, 35.5 x 29.9 cm. CSK, 25 June, #571, attributed to “Circle of Thomas Stothard,” illus. (not sold; estimate £800-1200). I do not believe that this painting is by Stothard, but it is an interesting essay in the sublime and probably of the period. Blake’s drawings of the same subject, The Witch of Endor: Saul and the Ghost of Samuel and Saul and the Ghost of Samuel, can be dated to c. 1775-80 (Butlin #74 recto and #75).
  
A Seated Ottoman Gentleman with Standing Female Attendants. Oil, 13.0 x 15.2 cm. Semley auction, Shaftesbury, 26 Jan., #65, illus. (not sold; estimate £200-300); 13 July, #211, illus. (no price information; estimate £100-200).Semley charges a fee to access sales results. I declined. Probably the design engraved as a book illus. and described by Coxhead as “a girl and a man sitting on a divan, her arm around his neck; attendants behind” (220). I have not been able to discover the text illustrated.
  
“The Letter,” an illus. to Frances Burney’s Cecilia, engraving by Joseph Strutt, 1792. EB, Nov., proof before title but with signatures and imprint, illus. (offered at the “buy it now” price of $497.50).
  
“The Lost Apple,” lithograph, 1803. Swann, 1 May, #286, on the original backing mount with aquatint border, illus. ($1680).
  
“Ruins of Palmyra,” etching/engraving signed “Stothard del.” and “[James] Heath sculp.,” design 12.5 x 17.6 cm., platemark 15.3 x 20.2 cm., on a leaf of wove paper 21.2 x 26.3 cm. EB, March, light marginal stains, illus. (£4.99 to Essick). Apparently a later st., without imprint but with framing lines added, of a pl. 1st published in William Frederick Martyn (pseudonym of William Fordyce Mavor), The Geographical Magazine; or, a New, Copious, Compleat, and Universal System of Geography, vol. 1 (London: Harrison and Co., 1785), pl. with a 1 May 1782 imprint facing 223. The later st. was very probably published in a book, as stabholes along the lower margin indicate, but I have not been able to identify the publication. Stothard also designed the frontispiece, engraved by Heath, for vol. 1 of the Geographical Magazine and delineated 2 further pls., “Ruins of Persepolis,” engraved by Andrew Birrell, and “View of the Porcelain Tower in Nankin in China,” engraved by William Angus. Vol. 2 of Martyn’s book, dated 1793, also contains a frontispiece designed by Stothard and engraved by Heath. Stothard very probably designed and executed drawings for the frontispieces, but the preliminary drawings for the 3 engraved views signed “Stothard del.” (delineavit, as distinct from invenit) were probably delineated by Stothard on the basis of images originally executed by artists who visited the sites pictured. Coxhead 168-69 lists only the 2 frontispieces and wrongly attributes their engraving to Blake; Bennett 66 correctly indicates “5 illus. by Stothard.”
  
“This Engraving, to Commemorate the Establishment of the British and Foreign Bible Society, Represents Britain Recommending the Sacred Records to the Attention of the Different Nations of the World,” engraved by William Henry Worthington and published by Robert Bowyer, 1816. EB, Nov., leaf of laid paper 42.8 x 53.9 cm., tears in margins, 1 extending into the title inscription, illus. ($75 to Essick). A large separate pl., image including inscriptions 39.2 x 49.0 cm. Not in Coxhead or Bennett.

Includes 1 pl. after Stothard, “Abelard and Eloisa,” engraved by William Sharp and dated 1788 in the imprint. This pl. 1st appeared in a 1787 issue by Lowndes and was used again in his 1802 reissue. Not in Coxhead or Bennett.

J. Thomson, The Works. London: J. Rivington and Sons, … T. Cadell, et al., 1788. EB, Aug.-Sept., 3 vols., contemporary calf worn, illus. (£78). Includes 3 pls. after Stothard illustrating Edward and Eleonora (engraved by John Keyse Sherwin), Tancred and Sigismunda (engraved by John Neagle), and Coriolanus (engraved by James Heath). All 3 pls. have 1788 imprints by “T. Cadell.” Coxhead 95-96 (describing the Coriolanus pl. as an illus. to Shakespeare) and 175 (the Edward and Eleonora pl.); the pl. of Tancred and Sigismunda not recorded. Apparently listed in Bennett 68, but only “Sigismunda” named. Neither Coxhead nor Bennett lists the book.
 
Appendix: New Information on Blake’s Engravings
 
Listed below are substantive additions or corrections to Robert N. Essick, The Separate Plates of William Blake: A Catalogue (1983), and Essick, William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations (1991).  Newly discovered impressions of previously recorded published sts. of Blake’s engravings are listed for only the rarer pls.
 
The Separate Plates of William Blake: A Catalogue
 
Pp. 17-20, “Job.” In Blake 44.4 (spring 2011): 116, 120, I noted my acquisition of the 2nd known impression (the so-called “Summers copy”) of the 1st st. of this pl. I can now give more information about its condition and history. The discovery of this impression was announced in Martin Butlin and Robin Hamlyn, “Tate Britain Reveals Nine New Blakes and Thirteen New Lines of Verse,” Blake 42.2 (fall 2008): 52-54. Butlin and Hamlyn state that “this impression has no inscriptions on the surviving area of margin below the intact image” and that this “suggests that the new copy is a proof before letters” (52). As illus. 1 accompanying their article shows, there is only a ragged thread margin below the center of the image where Blake’s signature (“Painted and Engraved by William Blake”) appears in the other 1st st. impression (1A, Keynes Family Trust, on deposit in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge). This margin measures 2.0 mm. over the initial “P” of “Painted,” the letter closest to the lower edge of the image. This just misses the top of the “P.” The 2.2 mm. margin between the image and the next highest letter, the “B” of “Blake,” also barely fails to reach its top. Elsewhere the even smaller margin is short of the tops of other letters by 0.2 mm. or more. The design itself is in the same st. as the portions of the Keynes impression not altered by its restoration, and thus there is no evidence that the Summers/Essick impression is in a st. different from the Keynes impression.
 
The original frame, dated by Butlin and Hamlyn to the “early to mid-nineteenth century” (52), includes some paper lining on its inner lip bearing a fragmentary letterpress text: “better done at no expense … allotted to the … really elicited eviden[ce] … th[e] adjustment of ….” This text matches, in wording, typography, spacing, and lineation, p. 145 of Jeremy Bentham, Justice and Codification Petitions (London: Robert Heward, 1829), thereby establishing a terminus a quo of 1829 for the frame. 
 
Butlin and Hamlyn record a pencil inscription on the frame that they tentatively transcribe as “Bennett” (52). Infrared photography has revealed the inscription as “Bennett 4,” upper center right of the frame when viewed from the back. This inscription was probably written by the frame-maker as a record of who ordered the frame; perhaps “Bennett” had ordered 4 frames in all or the number was used to distinguish this customer from 3 others with the same surname. This purchaser of both the print and its frame may have been Lady Mary Elizabeth Bennett (1785-1861), the 5th child of the 4th Earl of Tankerville, Chillingham Castle, Northumberland. She was a student of John Linnell’s, taking from him lessons in both engraving and painting miniature portraits (see Alfred T. Story, The Life of John Linnell [London: Richard Bentley and Son, 1892] 1: 219). We know that Linnell was instrumental in selling impression 2C (2nd st.) of “Job” on behalf of Blake’s wife, Catherine; he may have also been involved in the sale of impression 2D to Thomas Chevalier or Charles Heathcote Tatham, both well known to Linnell. It seems likely that Linnell also played a role in selling the Summers/Essick impression for Blake’s wife in 1829 or at a slightly later date before her death in 1831. It is less likely, because of poor relations between Linnell and Frederick Tatham, that Linnell had anything to do with a sale after Tatham had acquired Blake’s stock of works upon Mrs. Blake’s death, nor is there any record of contact between Tatham and Lady Mary Bennett. Thus the tentative provenance for the Summers/Essick impression is as follows: William Blake, thence by inheritance to his wife, Catherine, upon his death in 1827; sold by Catherine Blake (with the assistance of John Linnell) to Lady Mary Elizabeth Bennett between 1829 and 1831; by inheritance through the Bennett family, or by sale(s) to other parties, until May or June 2004, when acquired by a Lincolnshire antiques dealer at a house sale; sold by him at the Kempton Market, Sunbury-on-Thames, to Gabriel Summers of London in June 2004; sold by Summers to Robert Essick, Nov. 2010, John Windle acting as agent. The print was cleaned and matted by early 2011, the original frame, stretcher, and backing canvas retained separately.
  
P. 55, “Enoch,” impression 1B. For the acquisition of this impression by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, see under Separate Plates and Plates in Series, above.

P. 23, Josephus, Genuine and Complete Works. Four dates are listed for 4 issues of Josephus. At least 6 issues have now been recorded: BB issue A, BBS issue Ab, and BB issues B-E. These are tentatively dated as follows in BBS 228: 1785-87, 1787-88, 1788-89, 1789-90, 1791-92, and 1792-93. A 7th issue (call it Cb), not recorded in BB or BBS, would appear to fit chronologically between BB issues C and D—see Josephus under Letterpress Books with Engravings by and after Blake, above.

Newfound Particulars of Blake’s Patrons, Thomas and Elizabeth Butts, 1767–1806
 
By Mary Lynn Johnson
 
Mary Lynn Johnson (mary-grant@uiowa.edu), a retired special assistant in the University of Iowa president’s office, has written several essays on Blake’s biblical watercolors for Thomas Butts. For help in working through her recent archival findings, she thanks G. E. Bentley, Jr., Joseph Viscomi, Keri Davies, Morton Paley, Morris Eaves, and Sarah Jones.
 
 
  
As friendly benefactors of William and Catherine Blake, the clerk Thomas Butts (1759–1845) and his schoolmistress wife, née Elizabeth Mary Cooper (1754–1825), merit an occasional spotlight in the background of Blake studies.The pioneering discoveries of G. E. Bentley, Jr., “Thomas Butts, White Collar Maecenas,” PMLA 71 (1956): 1052-66, updated in Bentley, Blake Records, 2nd ed. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004), and in annual addenda to Blake Records, were expanded by Joseph Viscomi, “William Blake’s ‘The Phoenix / to Mrs Butts’ Redux,” Blake 29.1 (summer 1995): 12-15, “Blake in the Marketplace 1852: Thomas Butts, Jr. and Other Unknown Nineteenth-Century Blake Collectors,” Blake 29.2 (fall 1995): 40-68, and “A ‘Green House’ for Butts? New Information on Thomas Butts, His Residences, and Family,” Blake 30.1 (summer 1996): 4-21. Further information (see corrections in note 2) appears in Mary Lynn Johnson, “More on Blake’s (and Bentley’s) ‘White Collar Maecenas’: Thomas Butts, His Wife’s Family of Artisans, and the Methodist Withams of St. Bartholomew the Great,” Blake in Our Time: Essays in Honour of G. E. Bentley Jr, ed. Karen Mulhallen (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010) 131-64, said to contain “the most exhaustive research yielding the slimmest conclusions” (Clint Stevens, “Honoring G. E. Bentley, Jr.,” Eighteenth Century 53.4 [winter 2012]: 515). To published profiles of the couple may now be added details of their occupations, possessions, finances, and other circumstances from previously unexplored materials in the London Metropolitan Archives, the National Archives, parish records, and miscellaneous publications of the time. Corrections of earlier errors, along with additions to core facts about Butts’s family history and Methodist heritage, are noted here.Elizabeth Mary Cooper Butts’s dates should be 1754–1825, not 1753–1826 (see newfound records in note 3). Regrettably, I mistyped Thomas Butts’s death year (1845) as 1844 and disassociated the identity of his father (of the same name) from that of John Wesley’s “book steward,” “a compiler and publisher of hymnals” (Johnson, “More …” 160n49). In fact, the patron’s father (son of “Thomas Butts of Wap[ping] Apothecary [d. 1727/28] and Elizabeth” [née Eads, married 1 Apr. 1714])—that is, the baby who was baptized in St. Dunstan’s, Stepney (14 Aug. 1719), who was left fatherless and impoverished at eight, and who grew up to marry Hannah Witham, 19 May 1746—is frequently mentioned in papers of John and Charles Wesley. He and William Briggs were appointed to run Wesley’s publishing enterprise in 1753, a date also proposed for the earliest edition of his influential compilation Harmonia-Sacra: or, A Choice Collection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes … (John Rylands Library, Methodist Printed Collections). In 1754 he joined other Wesley associates who protected the controversial young kidnapping victim and convicted perjurer Elizabeth Canning in prison. Under questioning, he identified himself as “one of his Majesty’s Landwaiters” at his Ratcliffe Row address (spelled variously), confirming a descendant’s note on his work in the “Customs House” (Viscomi, “A ‘Green House’ for Butts?” 5), where his official title was “Deputy King’s Waiter.” On 20 June 1766 he co-signed an appeal for funds to clear a debt of “upwards” of £1400 incurred by the Reformation Society. On 25 Aug. 1767, now identified as a “watch-spring-maker” (although Christ’s Hospital school had apprenticed him, at almost fifteen, to a linen draper in 1734), Butts reappears as a bankrupt. An auction (advertised 3 Oct. 1767) “at his house, No. 14, in Radcliff-row” featured “his fine collection of prints, and some valuable pictures; his large and well-chosen library of books,” and his organ, harpsichord, and music collection. In the same year, the father of Blake’s eight-year-old future patron married Ann Cook (Viscomi, “A ‘Green House’ for Butts?” 6) and moved to Hackney. In 1769, in a payment of dividends to his creditors, he is again identified as “Watch-spring Maker, Dealer and Chapman” at his old address. But after his death, when his three life insurance policies were paid on 8 July 1779, he is listed as “Exchange Broker,” “heretofore of Ratcliffe-row, near St. Luke’s, Old-Street, but late of Homerton”—another town in Hackney. He was “struck off” the list of brokers by a Court of Aldermen on 2 Oct. 1771 but “sworn broker” in the same court on 26 Jan. 1773. As “T.B.,” he may also be the author of A Letter from a Private Person to His Pastor, concerning the People Called Methodists (c. 1743), Gale doc. no. CW123344497, Eighteenth Century Collections Online [hereafter ECCO]. An unrelated correction: in “‘Catalogue of Some of Blake’s Pictures at “The Salterns”’: Captain Butts as Exhibitor, Litigator, and Co-heir (with His Sister Blanche),” UTQ 80.4 (fall 2011): 893-917, I mistyped Butts the patron’s 1759 birth date as 1739 (abstract and opening paragraph).
  
Particulars of Elizabeth Mary Cooper (Butts), 1767–1801
  
Elizabeth Mary Cooper, having served a seven-year apprenticeship to a schoolmistress (1767–74), later supervised five apprentices for overlapping terms (1782–95) in her own school, beginning with her sister Elyn, and among her pupils were at least two whose parents were not married. Elizabeth’s carver-gilder father, Joseph Cooper, and her mother, Elizabeth, née Yardley (daughter of silversmith George Yardley and Winifred, née Nash), who were married in the bride’s parish of St. Olave, Silver Street (17 July 1750), baptized their two sons and four elder daughters in that parish (1751–64) and their two younger daughters in St. Mary, Islington (1768–70), almost two miles north.Baptismal dates of the young Coopers later mentioned in the will of their father, Joseph Cooper “of Noble Street Foster Lane” (probated 20 Apr. 1801 [Johnson, “More …” 146]) are George Yardley, 10 June 1751; Elizabeth Mary, 23 Jan. 1754; Anne, 4 July 1755; Joseph [Jr.],  22 Nov. 1756; Frances, 4 Aug. 1762; Winifred Nash, 27 July 1764 (all at St. Olave, Silver Street); Ellin [“Elyn,” in her father’s will], 12 Aug. 1768; Sarah, 15 June 1770 (both at St. Mary, Islington); see London Metropolitan Archives [hereafter LMA], P69/​OLA3/​A/​001/​MS06534, London, England, Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, 1538–1812 (Provo: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2010 [hereafter ancestry.com]). Elizabeth, born and christened on 23 Jan. 1754, was a few months younger than had been derived from the age “72” recorded at her burial on 4 Apr. 1825 in St. Bartholomew the Great, her husband’s ancestral parish (Johnson, “More …” 161n55; see image 2 [of 6] for 1825 in LMA, St. Bartholomew the Great, Register of Burials, 1813–1843, P69/​BAT3/​A/​011/​MS06781, item 003, in London, England, Deaths and Burials, 1813–1980, ancestry.com). For the parish record of Butts’s burial beside his wife on 1 May 1845 (d. 25 Apr.), see this church’s Register of Burials, 1843–1853, P69/​BAT3/​A/​011/​MS06781, item 004, in London, England, Deaths and Burials, 1813–1980, ancestry.com. On 3 October 1767, Mary Blackstone “of St Mary Islington Middx School Mistress” took thirteen-year-old “Eliz. Cooper” as her apprentice for a seven-year term that began on 7 September 1767, paying a stamp duty of 0/10/6 on a premium of £21, presumably supplied by Elizabeth’s father.Extracted from the Commissioner of Stamps’ Register of Duties Paid for Apprentices’ Indentures, 1710–1811 (National Archives, via ancestry.com), IR 1, piece 25, p. 105, images 490-91 of 1893, cited hereafter by piece, page, and image/set numbers. Arranged by payment dates (regardless of location) in two-page spreads often lacking column headers, the registry shows names of masters and apprentices, occupations, addresses, number of indentures, term lengths, and premiums received by masters. As duties could be paid at any time from the beginning of an indenture until a year after its completion, dates of masters’ payments and apprentices’ terms may be at considerable variance. Premiums received for indentures up to and including £50 were taxed at sixpence to the pound (2.5%), or £1/5/0 on £50; for any portion above £50, the rate was a shilling to the pound (5%), although in some ledgers the five-percent rate is applied to the entire amount, and in others the lower-tier portion is simply ignored. After completing her term in September 1774, Elizabeth was qualified for employment in a school or a private home.Probably in anticipation of Elizabeth’s departure, schoolmistress Blackstone took on Sarah Pennington for a premium of £31/10/0 for a seven-year apprenticeship beginning 20 Oct. 1773, paying a duty of 0/15/9 on 19 Nov. 1773 (piece 28, p. 3, images 701-02/1930). The location of Blackstone’s school on “The Upper Street,” one of the two main streets in the hilltop village of Islington, may be derived from her 1767 payment of land tax of £1/15/0 on rent of £15 at that address. In the same year, Elizabeth’s father paid £1/12/8 on rent of £14 on “Well’s Ron,” another (unmapped?) street in Islington.
  
On 18 July 1782, in her own establishment, “Elizth Cooper[,] South Moulton St Co of Middlesex School Mistress” accepted her sister Elyn, not quite fourteen, as her first apprentice for a premium of £70, on which she paid a £1 duty (only on the amount above £50; see note 4) at term’s end on “Tues. 21 July 1789.” On 6 September 1784, establishing a pattern of two-year intervals, she accepted Augusta Johnson for a seven-year term under an indenture of £71, for which both “Elizth and Thos Butts[,] South Molton St. Co. of Middx” paid a £1/1/0 duty on 16 July 1789. On 28 September 1787, “Eliz. Butts[,] St George Hanover Square School Mistress” paid 15s. on £30 for two indentures for Elizabeth Parker, whose seven-year apprenticeship had begun on 13 August 1786. Running concurrently with Elyn’s, Augusta’s, and Elizabeth’s terms was the three-year apprenticeship of Margaret Barker, 27 May 1784 to May 1787, for which Elizabeth Butts had paid £1/5/0 on £50 for two indentures (23 July 1785). And finally, on 9 June 1789, “Elizth Butts[,] St Jame’s [sic] … School Mistress,” in the parish of her post-1788 school and family home on Great Marlborough Street, paid a duty of 15s. on £30 for Lydia Pitman’s two indentures for a seven-year term, 16 May 1788 to May 1795.For Elyn’s apprenticeship, see piece 34, p. 83, images 1941-42/​2020. Oddly, premiums for seven-year terms ranged from £30 (for Elizabeth [33, 146-47, 1609-10/​2020] and Lydia [32, 71, 1917-18/​2020]) to £71 (for Augusta [34, 82, 1939-40/​2020]), while Margaret’s three-year term fetched a premium of £50 (32, 181, 1224-25/​2020).
  
The only two pupils in Mrs. Butts’s school presently identifiable by name, as recorded in their fathers’ wills, were acknowledged daughters of unmarried mothers. Captain James Denty’s “natural Daughter Elizabeth Denty … about seven years of age now at Mrs. Butts Boarding School in South Molton Street” (1790) was to receive £600 on her twenty-first birthday (Johnson, “More …” 148, 164n64). And in an 1801 codicil to his 1796 will, the bachelor Benjamin Charles Collins (d. 1808) named as sole beneficiary of the residue of his estate “Maria Castle (so called) at Mrs Butts Ladies School, Great Marlbro [sic] Street, Carnaby Market the said Maria to be a ward of Chancery.” Maria’s mother was presumably Mary Elizabeth Goodenge, “calling herself Mary Castle now residing with me at No. 40 New Road in the parish of St Mary le Bone Middlesex.”PROB 11/1478/213, 6 May 1808; transcribed in Christine Y. Ferdinand, Benjamin Collins and the Provincial Newspaper Trade in the Eighteenth Century (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997) 221-24. At thirty-four, Elizabeth Denty (b. 22 May 1782) married William Carter on 23 May 1816 in Islington, with her half-brother Col. H[enry] F[rancis] Denty as a witness (Linley and Jim Hooper’s family history site).
  
Particulars of Thomas Butts, 1786–1806
  
In 1786, when Thomas Butts lost a “Note of Hand,” or promissory note, for the large sum of £150, his advertised address, complete with street number, was that of his wife’s school: LOST, between South Molton-street and Cavendish-square, a Note of Hand for 150l, drawn by Thos. Butts, No. 63, South Molton-street, payable to Edward Johns, on order, due 21st inst. and indorsed. As the note is paid, it will be of no use. Whoever will bring it to Messrs. Hercy, B[irch], and Hobbs, New Bond-street, shall receive One Guinea Reward.Morning Post and Daily Advertiser 23 Mar. 1786, issue 4087 (Gale doc. no. Z2000954796, 17th–18th Century Burney Collection Newspapers). This newly reported house number, with a rental value of £10 (reflected in Butts’s payment of poor rates for 1784; see “ratebook_151-15109” at ﻿http://​www.​londonlives.​org/​formRef.​jsp﻿), places the Buttses on the southeastern side of South Molton Street, near its diagonal intersection with Brook Street, toward New Bond Street. (When the Blakes moved to no. 17 in 1803, they were on the northwestern side, nearer Oxford Street.)  The pedestrian route from the Buttses’ home to Cavendish Square, north of Oxford Street, zigzags in the opposite direction from the New Bond Street addresses of Edward Johns, “ironmonger, brazier, and hardwareman,” at 141, and the banking firm of Hercy, Birch, and Hobbs (formerly Chambers) at 152 (F. G. Hilton Price, A Handbook of London Bankers … [London: Chatto and Windus, 1876] 23). Johns’s advertised boast (single-sheet flier) that the superiority of his tin-lined copper kitchen vessels had been proved in “the ARMY and NAVY” invites speculation that the Musters office authorized Butts’s transaction (Edward Johns, Ironmonger, Brazier, and Hardwareman, … / Copper Kitchen Furniture / by His Majesty’s Royal Letters Patent [London, 1780?], Gale doc. no. CW3305948953, ECCO). Ironmonger Johns also sold the “New-invented SALISBURY PORTABLE KITCHEN,” in which “a joint may be roasted, and another boiled, with vegetables and puddings all at the same time, with less than two pennyworth of charcoal”; while still hot, it could bake “a loaf in one part, and pyes, tarts, cakes, rolls, or muffins in the other.” It was marketed “to those who have not proper convenience for cooking, and to Gentlemen at their country and hunting seats; also to merchants’ ships, and officers in camp …” (Morning Post and Daily Advertiser 20 July 1780, issue 2414, Gale doc. no. Z2000943565, 17th–18th Century Burney Collection Newspapers). This address is in the parish of St. George, Hanover Square, where Elizabeth had lived before her marriage and where the Buttses’ first son, Joseph Edward, was baptized in 1784 (Johnson, “More …” 146), before the family moved to Great Marlborough Street.
  
Butts’s occupation before his marriage to Elizabeth on 21 December 1782, while he was living across town in the parish of St. George the Martyr (Johnson, “More …” 145) and not yet employed by the chief clerk in the office of the Commissary General of Musters in 1783 (Bentley, “Thomas Butts” 1053), remains unknown. Perhaps he was a coal merchant. Registers of the Sun Fire Office, which record policy numbers and summarize the policies themselves, show that on 24 September 1792, “Thomas Butts No 9 Great Marlborough Street Coal Merchant” insured his “now dwelling House only Brick” for “Fifteen hundred pounds,” and his “Stable Coachhouse and Brewhouse adjoining in Blenheim Mews Brick” for “Two hundred pounds.” On “21 July 1796” this “Coal Merchant” paid 16s. to insure the family’s personal property for £750, itemized as “Household Goods” for £450, “Printed Books, Plate, and Pictures” for £150 at “Fifty pounds on each,” “Wearing Apparel” for £100, and “Prints Drawings and Needle Work” for £50.LMA, CLC/​B/​192/​F/​001/​MS11936/​389/​605407 and CLC/​B/​192​/F/​001/​MS11936/​407/​655896. See ﻿http://​www.​history.​ac.​uk/​gh/​fire.​htm﻿; J. H. Thomas, “Fire Insurance Policy Registers,” History 53 (Oct. 1968): 381-84, no. 19 in “Short Guides to Records,” ed. Lionel M. Munby (reprinted in Short Guides to Records, ed. Munby [1972]); H. A. L. Cockerell and Edwin Green, The British Insurance Business: A Guide to Its History and Records, 2nd ed. (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1994); L. D. Schwarz and L. J. Jones, “Wealth, Occupations, and Insurance in the Late Eighteenth Century: The Policy Registers of the Sun Fire Office,” Economic History Review 36.3 (Aug. 1983):  365-73. The insured “Needle Work” brings to mind a piece attributed in part to Blake, the “Two Hares” embroidery by William Blake and Mrs. Butts (c. 1790–1800) (Fitzwilliam Museum). In a comprehensive investigation of the order in which Blake signed and sold his large color prints, Viscomi has proposed that Butts’s insured “Pictures” included three color prints by Blake, “Hecate, Satan, and Pity,” signed c. 1795–96, an acquisition leading up to his 1799 commission of the biblical tempera series.“Signing Large Color Prints: The Significance of Blake’s Signatures,” Huntington Library Quarterly (forthcoming 2014).
  
In 1788, when Butts and his associate William Woodman were jointly promoted to chief clerk, each earned £91/5/0; by 1797, Butts’s official salary had soared to a three-year average of £430/14/8 (Bentley, “Thomas Butts” 1053-54), not counting the sideline coal business, which is confirmed also in the 1807 will of Butts’s maternal uncle, Thomas Witham, and doubtless accounts for Butts’s later payments to Blake in coals (Johnson, “More …” 138, 145).Presumably Butts belonged to the “class of middle-men who are called in the trade ‘Brass-plate Coal-Merchants:’ … who have no wharfs, but merely give their orders to some true coal-merchant,” thereby increasing consumers’ costs (Charles Babbage, On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures [London: Charles Knight, 1832] 124). The “Stable Coachhouse” insured in 1792 is a mark of affluence; perhaps the adjoining “Brewhouse” in Blenheim Mews, behind the school’s long back garden, brought in rent from a tenant. In 1799 Butts’s estimated annual taxable income of about £468/13/0 from all sources gave him a foothold in the upper middle class.The adjusted income of “Thos Butts, Esq., Gt Marlboro,” taxed at ten percent (ignoring the complicated allowances for children of various ages), is derived from his payment of £46/17/4 recorded in “Individual Tax Payments, Income More Than 60 Pounds” (UK Data Archive, London; History Data Service Study no. 3785 by T. V. Jackson, compiled from E182/630 in the Public Record Office [now National Archives]; see “Additional Datasets  Income Tax Payments 1799–1802” at ﻿http://​www.​londonlives.​org/​formPersName.​jsp﻿); see also Jackson, “British Incomes circa 1800,” Economic History Review 52.2 (May 1999): 257-83. For this first-ever income tax, imposed on 9 Jan. 1799 under Pitt the Younger to pay for the oncoming Napoleonic Wars, incomes estimated below £60 were not taxed; between £60 and £200 the rates increased according to £5 increments in income; those in the highest bracket, above £200, were taxed at ten percent. Among Butts’s neighbors on the same street, only one, Culpepper Conant, paid less: £6/15/0, indicating an income of only £145-50 or so, according to “Scale of Ascent from £60 to £200” in Tax on Income. A Correct Abridgment of the Act for Imposing a Tax on All Income, 5th ed. (London, 1799), Gale doc. no. CW3304852647, ECCO. Married women who owed taxes were listed separately (Jackson, “British Incomes” 272-73); the absence of an entry for schoolmistress Butts suggests that her adjusted income fell below the £60 threshold.  For a rough guide to Butts’s purchasing power, see H. M. Boot, “Real Incomes of the British Middle Class, 1760–1850: The Experience of Clerks at the East India Company,” Economic History Review 52.4 (Nov. 1999): 638-68, and, less technically, Edward Copeland, “Money,” The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen, ed. Edward Copeland and Juliet McMaster, rev. ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011) 127-43.
  
The promotion of Butts and Woodman was retroactive to 2 June 1788, the date their employer, “George Hesse, esq.,” returned from gambling at the Phillimore Club “about two o’clock in the morning,” went into the library of “his house in the Adelphi,” wrote letters to his mother, his wife (née Gunthorp[e], daughter of a wealthy West India merchant), and to “Mr. Agar, Mr. Crawford, and Mr. Woodman,” “charged very lightly one of his own travelling pistols,” and shot himself through the mouth. “His pecuniary affairs, from deep play” had “sustained a shock of the most momentous nature.”Almost verbatim accounts appeared in such papers as the Times (4 June 1788, with “Further Particulars” on 5 June), the Morning Post and Daily Advertiser (4 June 1788), and, quoted here, the June issue of Gentleman’s Magazine (58, pt. 1 [1788]: 563-64). Hesse also kept company with the Prince of Wales and with political satirist Caleb Whitefoord, who corresponded with Benjamin Franklin’s grandson about extending hospitality to Mrs. Hesse on her 1783 visit to Paris (The Whitefoord Papers … [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1898] 190-91; see also ﻿http://​franklinpapers.org/​franklin/​framedNames.​jsp﻿). For a searching analysis of the case, with further citations of insiders’ gossip in the English Chronicle (3 June 1788), General Evening Post (5 and 7 June 1788), and elsewhere, see Donna T. Andrew, Aristocratic Vice: The Attack on Duelling, Suicide, Adultery, and Gambling in Eighteenth-Century England (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2013) 99-101. When the body was discovered six hours later, a “Coroner’s Inquisition” was quickly convened, with Butts and Woodman among the deponents.
  
“Thomas Butt[s] late Clerk to Mr. Hesse, the Deced[ent],” appearing “before Thomas Prickard, Gentleman, Coroner of our said Lord the King … on View of the Body of George Adam Calcraft Hesse Esqr then and there lying dead,” “on his Oath saith That he has lived with the Deced / almost five Years, Deced being Chief Clerk to the / Commissary General of Musters.”All quotations from these depositions are transcribed, via ﻿http://​www.​londonlives.​org﻿, from City of Westminster Coroners: Coroners’ Inquests into Suspicious Deaths, 5 Jan. 1788–29 Dec. 1788, WACWIC652280332 [Butts’s and Woodman’s testimony, 2 June 1788] and WACWIC652280323 [jurors’ names and verdict]. Hesse’s name is inserted by hand into a printed form in which coroner Prickard’s name appears in italics. Butts’s oath that he “lived with” Hesse for “almost five Years” (1783–88), surely referring only to the workday, indicates that his clerkship had begun in the second half of 1783. Hesse’s home at 1-2 Adam Street in “the Adelphi,” designed by the Adam brothers, was about a mile from the Musters office at Horse Guards on Whitehall. Hesse was also “Computer of Off-reckonings,” at £80, in the Office of Paymaster General (London Calendar [1788] 165), among several sinecures obtained through his well-connected father, John Adam Frederick Hesse (1716–83). The younger Hesse, “by his interest with the then paymasters-general of the forces, Lord North and Mr. Cooke, in whose office the elder Mr. H. held a situation of considerable emolument,” received £600 a year after sixteen years there, augmented by the Musters appointment, “which, in time of war, has attached to it considerable advantages”; by 1788 his “official income amounted annually to the sum of 1500l,” not counting the “liberal fortune” of his wife (Gentleman’s Magazine; see note 13, above). Butts swore that Hesse “for about three Weeks last past has been / dejected and very low Spirited, and often in / Dep[onen]t.[’s] hearing Said that he did not know what / he was doing, and Dept. saw him do things / that he did not intend to do …. And Dept. says / that the Deced was at times Disordered in / his Mind. Says that he Understood that / there were some [inserted above line] loose Papers and Letters / found in Deced’s Parlour this Morning, but / none directed to this Dept. to his Knowledge.” After Woodman’s corroborating testimony, the jury reached a verdict: Hesse “being a Lunatick Shot himself with a Pistol Ball ….”
  
At probate hearings on “26th January 1790,” Thomas Butts, “Coal Merchant,” and Reuben Smith, “Wine Merchant” (also one of fifteen jurors at the inquest), “having frequently seen the said deceased write and also Subscribe his name,” authenticated Hesse’s handwritten one-sentence will, dated “1 June 1788 London.” The will names Woodman as an administrator of the depleted estate, “which if it were Millions I bequeath to my most beloved and adorable Wife all and every thing in my power to give and grant I trust she will have both real and personal.”National Archives, PROB 11/1188/88, 9 Feb. 1790. Butts’s purported signature on the probate document (apparently by a surrogate, as Hesse’s signature is also part of the record) lacks the distinctive “B” discussed in Viscomi, “A ‘Green House’ for Butts?” and visible on appointment papers of Thomas Higgins (29 Dec. 1804 [Johnson, “More …” 152n11]) and George Collard (17 Oct. 1805 [lot 20, Bonhams auction 18847, 7 June 2011; ﻿http://​www.​bonhams.​com/​auctions/​18847/​lot/​20﻿]). Not seen: Butts’s signature on Evelyn P. Dormer’s appointment to captain, 6 June 1811, DR225/115, Shakespeare Centre Library and Archive, Stratford-upon-Avon.
  
At some point, perhaps as a way of managing and dividing perquisites and emoluments after their joint elevation to Hesse’s vacated position, Butts and Woodman formed a private partnership. On 3 July 1802, as Woodman’s retirement approached, they terminated the agreement: “Notice is hereby given, that the Copartnership between William Woodman and Thomas Butts, of Whitehall, Westminster, Army and Half-Pay Agents, is this Day dissolved by mutual Consent. All Debts owing to or from the said partnership Concern will be received and paid by the said Thomas Butts only.”London Gazette, issue 15494, p. 709. When the Musters office was abolished on 25 Sept. 1818, Woodman received a pension of £200, on the basis of fourteen years’ service (1788–1802), while Butts, having served thirty-five years (1783–1818), received £430, and his sons “1st Senior Clerk” Joseph Edward, appointed in 1799, and “3rd” clerk Thomas, appointed in 1803, received £140 and £99 (Estimates and Accounts: Army; Navy; Ordnance; Civil List … andc. 11 [21 Apr.–23 Nov. 1820]: [203 (handwritten p. 195)]). And at last, under “Monies paid by” in “An Account of the Income of the Consolidated Fund of Great Britain, for the year ended the 5th day / of January 1806,” “Thomas Butts, on Account of the late George Hesse, Esq.,” discharged what must have been Hesse’s final obligation of “£1,351/16/7.”H.M. Stationery Office, Journals of the House of Commons 61 (1806 [46 Geo. III]): 650, in appendix no. 16, under a header spreading to p. 651.
  
As Bentley and Viscomi have shown, Thomas and Elizabeth Butts’s residences, occupations, and expenditures have a bearing on the formation of their Blake collection. The present collection of minutiae is offered in the hope that some oddly angled fact, spotted by a foraging scholar, will jibe with another fact at just the right point to nudge a worthy project forward, toward the general advancement of Blake studies.

Francis Quarles’s Influence on Europe 11
 
By Paul Miner
 
Paul Miner (paulminer@cableone.net) has written more than fifty studies on Blake.
 
 
  
William Blake frequently turned to Francis Quarles’s Emblemes, 1635, for graphic and textual inspiration.All citations of Blake are from The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, ed. David V. Erdman, newly rev. ed. (New York: Anchor–Random House, 1988). Scholars have particularly called attention to Blake’s evocative revision of Quarles’s multiplex emblem XV (book 1, pp. 60-63),See Mary Lynn Johnson, “Emblem and Symbol in Blake,” Huntington Library Quarterly 37 (1974): 156-60, and Judith Wardle, “‘For Hatching Ripe’: Blake and the Educational Uses of Emblem and Illustrated Literature,” Bulletin of Research in the Humanities 81 (1978): 340-41. Scholars such as Piloo Nanavutty (“Blake and Emblem Literature” [1952]) and Aquilino Sánchez Pérez (Blake’s Graphic Work and the Emblematic Tradition [1982]) have also recognized that Blake crucially was influenced by emblematic literature. See also Joseph S. Salemi, “Emblematic Tradition in Blake’s The Gates of Paradise,” Blake 15.3 (winter 1981-82): 108-24. a depiction—erroneously identified as part of book 2—that portrays Fraud as a malevolent female (“double fraud” with “her divided face”).In “then She bore Pale desire,” c. 1780-83(?), Blake concludes that “Guile and fraud” live “in the Smoke of Cities. on Dusky wing,” where each man’s “face” of self love is “a mask unto his heart” (E 448); he has in mind the emblem of Fraud in Cesare Ripa’s Iconologia, 1603, where a two-faced human vulture holds two hearts and a mask. A similar emblem is in George Richardson’s Iconology (based upon Ripa’s emblems), vol. 2 (London, 1779), fig. 386, text pp. 135-36, a work from which Blake borrowed graphic themes. Fraud therefore “does scourge and teare / Astræas wounded sides, [which are] plough’d up [like furrows], and rent / With knotted cords.”Flagellated Astræa symbolizes Justice; in classical mythology she perceives earth’s depravity and flees to the pristine heavens at the end of the Iron Age, becoming the constellation Virgo. Quarles inquires, “Has Justice now found wings?” (see winged Virgo in John Flamsteed’s Atlas Coelestis, 1729) and  does “Justice see?” (presumably because Justice, from the fifteenth century, frequently was envisioned as blind). On the right side of the emblem, “Faiths pineons [are] clipt” with scissors by Sense (also personified as a female). Blake, however, alters Quarles’s theme in his emblem 11 for both versions of The Gates of Paradise, issued respectively as For Children (1793) and For the Sexes (c. 1825-26).Blake changes the sexes; in For Children a myopic ancient man as “Aged Ignorance” attempts to cut the wings of flamboyant Sense, a youth greeting the joys of the dawn. When Blake reissued this plate in For the Sexes, he added genitals to the body of this winged youth, symbolic of fleshly desire, along with the legend “Perceptive Organs [related to sight] closed their Objects close” (see Jerusalem 30.55-56, E 177). “Aged Ignorance” (recall “aged ignorance” who cants moralities in Europe 12.7-8, E 64) clips with a pair of scissors the wings of “all Sublunary Things” (“The Keys of the Gates” no. 11, E 268). In Quarles’s emblem Faith has “Her wings … clipt [with scissors], and eyes [of perception] put out by Sense”; once “Quick-seeing” and “Sense-conq’ring,” she has now “growne blind, and cold.” In “The Keys of the Gates,” Blake describes “Aged Ignorance,” a figure he equates with Satan (see “Keys” no. 11, E 268, where the speaker clearly is Satan), as “Holy and cold.” Hence, in Blake’s realignment in For the Sexes, Satan as blind morality shears the wings of Sense.
 
The above particulars lead to the observation that Blake made additional use of Quarles’s emblem, namely the dominating vignette of an airborne, hoofed devil engulfed in flames. This blackened devil with widespread bat wings sits on a suspended throne in heaven, presiding over the earthly assaults on Astræa and Faith by Fraud and Sense. He is described by Quarles as an “evill … corrupter of the world” (63), and the text quotes Revelation 12.12: “The Devill is come unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” Quarles’s agitated devil as a “Usurper mounts the seat / Of royall Majestie” (61), wearing an imperial crown and holding a kingly forked scepter in his left hand, while his right hand holds a writhing serpent.
 
In plate 11 of Europe, 1794, politically oriented Blake implements Quarles’s iconography in a design in which a bat-winged pope wearing a papal crown as a high priest in the dark heavens sits on the chair of God, supervising the universe.See also the pope with bat wings in Night Thoughts 91 and the devil-hoofed pope wearing a conical mitre in Night Thoughts 396. In Night Thoughts 349 a swirling enraged “Leviathan” (Edward Young’s word) with flaming carbuncle on his head (Blake’s addition) is seen in the “foaming Billow” devouring “High Titles”; these high titles are envisioned by Blake as a web-handed scaly priest wearing a papal tiara, with a profile suspiciously close to that of George III (compare the caricature of George III in “John Bull Humbugg’d,” 12 May 1794). Blake’s devil-pope holds an open book, suggesting a book of judgment.Compare the book of chaos held by satanic Urizen, a figure possessing a crown-like halo in Urizen pl. 5, and the open book of stars held by a supernal female in Night Thoughts 501. The laws of this “brazen Book” in Europe 11 are “copied on Earth” by “Kings and Priests” (lines 3-4, E 64).

In Europe 11 the winglike bat ears on the corpulent pope’s head form in double vision a winged cherub,Compare the winged heads in Blake’s watercolors of The Death of St. Joseph and The Death of the Virgin, dated 1803. and Blake with purpose enhances such pictorial irony, as the chair in heaven is the English king’s coronation chair, housed in Westminster Abbey. As an apprentice Blake spent five years extensively sketching the monuments in Westminster Abbey, and he undoubtedly knew that beneath the chair was secreted the sacred Stone of Destiny (known also as the coronation stone), associated with Jacob’s Pillow, a stone engendering a dream wherein a ladder reached to the biblical heavens.The coronation stone is also called the Stone of Scone, which was taken from Scotland by Edward I in 1296; it was returned in 1996, after 700 years.
 
Blake deviously moved the gothic panels on the sides of this famous throne to the back, in order to simulate the bat ears of the ungodly pontiff. (In copy G the pope’s bat ears are not flesh colored, and thus appear to be an integral part of the throne’s design.)See G. E. Bentley, Jr., Blake Books (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977) 155. Significantly, Blake’s unholy divine potentially possesses the caricatured countenance of portly George III, a topical reflection of Quarles’s emblem that reveals “the seat / Of royall Majestie.” In a further irony, Quarles’s Fraud and Sense find their Blakean analogues in the two attending angelsThe crossed fleur-de-lis scepters with three leaves each held by these female angels may signify the English king’s “golden sceptre, with its cross” and top, which “rises into a fleur-de-lis, of six leaves” (B. Lambert, The History and Survey of London and Its Environs, vol. 4 [London, 1806] 117). to the left and right beneath the bat-winged pope.In his annotations to Bacon’s Essays, Blake violently rejected Bacon’s assertion that “a king is a mortal god on earth, unto whom the living God hath lent his own name” (E 624), and executed an obscene drawing in which a chain of excrement descends from the “devils arse,” ending in the inscription “A King” (E 624). See Robert W. Rix, “Blake, Bacon and ‘The Devils Arse,’” Blake 37.4 (spring 2004): 137-44. Thus, scatology becomes eschatology. Rejecting “Kingship ﻿or Allegoric Godship﻿,” Blake declared that God exists only in the extraneous “﻿Effluvia﻿” of kings and priests (annotations to Thornton, E 669).

In 2003 I remember grumbling to a friend about being unable to find a publisher for a collection of letters I had worked on for some years. The university presses aren’t interested in editions of diaries or letters anymore, I complained; they want content with a broader appeal, more relevance. I looked dolefully at my muffin. My friend commiserated. But then his eyes shone as he thought of something: “Why don’t you add ‘9/11’ to the title—you know, like Arthur Hugh Clough and 9/11 or The Politics of 9/11 in the Early Sonnets of Felicia Hemans? Everybody’s doing it. You’ll have Oxford banging down the door.”
 
I never did find a way of slipping it in, but the cynical humor of the idea offered some comfort. Now, of course, “2.0” has replaced “9/11” as the latest numerical talisman. Take an old category with a massively general subject area, tack on “2.0,” and you’ve got an instant bestseller. Hence, Travel Writing 2.0, Literacy 2.0, Fashion 2.0, and, naturally, Me 2.0. At the prospect of Revolution 2.0, Blake would have clapped his hands in joy, though The Wired Church 2.0 would no doubt have given him pause, conjuring unpleasant images of priests in “The Garden of Love.” There’s no doubt that “Web 2.0” has become the magic bullet, the formula du jour for success in the book industry, and it has now crept, inevitably, into the academy. The question is, what does it mean?
 
Although Web 2.0 sounds like a technical upgrade of the World Wide Web, in actuality it refers to a fundamental change in the way people use the internet. As opposed to the original version, Web 2.0 takes social networking sites as its model and constructs what Tim O’Reilly has called an “architecture of participation.” Rather than serving as a platform for specific content that has been written and designed by a set of editors and that is updated periodically, Web 2.0 uses the internet as a form of collective mind, focusing on the “authoring” function of the “user” and on dynamic content that is continually being created and amended. Taking its cue from Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, blogs, and wikis, Web 2.0 is genuinely interactive, positing a collaborative model of ongoing content creation and development. In Web 2.0 the terms “user” and “participant” thus become interchangeable. Users themselves generate and design the content by activities such as posting comments and reviews, creating folksonomies, video sharing, podcasting, tagging, and remixing. A useful scholarly paradigm for this brave new world is Wikipedia, which relies for its information, and its very existence, on the collective knowledge (and goodwill) of web participants from around the world.
 
The editors of Blake 2.0 are keenly aware of the digital moment and the widespread reassessment of the humanities that is currently underway. They tap into the growing excitement over the digital humanities and attempt to reinvent Blake studies by offering a collection of essays on Blake’s “ongoing regeneration” in a new virtual world (1). The authors are engaged by the “broader possibilities of digitalization and web dissemination” and they set out to examine Blake’s virtual selves as they appear in the “processes of translation, mutation, proliferation into other media” (2). Another title for this collection might have been Anxiety of Influence 2.0, as many of the essays rethink Harold Bloom’s patrilineal model of literary competition for the twenty-first century. In place of his Freudian “writer-on-writer” contest (3), they propose alternative theories of influence based on the new media. Most of the reception studies assembled here focus on the transformation of Blake’s work as it is appropriated in film, music, sculpture, graphic novels, and digital art, and they find that “agency can occur across a network” (4). Indeed, one of the threads that recurs time and again is the role of the author, the problem of ownership and possession, the conundrum of “mineness,” as the editors state. What happens to the author function in the new digital surround? Is there still a recognizable self, or has nineteenth- and twentieth-century selfhood vanished into an evanescent cloud of virtual selves? Where is Blake 1.0 and does he still matter? Or has he become like Urizen, “Unknown, unprolific! / Self-closd,” an “all-repelling” book of brass? These questions cut to the quick of the collection.
 
The editors divide the seventeen essays that constitute the book into four sections, “Blakean Circulations,” “Blake and Visual Art,” “Blake in Film and Graphic Arts,” and “Blake in Music.” While the first section engages many of the topics mentioned above, the last three analyze Blake in relation to various artistic movements, academic disciplines, and specific artworks. Individual essays explore Blake and surrealism, contemporary sculpture, and art therapy—plus music by everyone from Benjamin Britten to the Fugs (Bob Dylan, Jim Morrison, and Sir Hubert Parry feature prominently). On balance, though, most of the essays read like standard reception studies that explicate modern adaptations of Blake’s works—the interventions, transmutations, “phagocytotic transformation” (22), or, more simply put, the robust mental fight between contemporary artist and canonical poet. At the same time, they refract reception theory through a variety of lenses, among them biography (Angus Whitehead), art history (Colin Trodd, Mei-Ying Sung), art therapy (Philippa Simpson), film criticism (Susan Matthews, Mark Douglas), Lacan (Mark Lussier), comics studies (Matthew J. A. Green), performance studies (Tristanne Connolly), and music criticism (David Fallon). Each essay pursues a number of creative readings and misreadings of the poet’s works in an effort to interrogate “the ‘Second Life’ of Blake’s texts and art” (10).
 
While many of the pieces are informative and open up new vistas on the influence of Blake’s ideas in the twentieth century—Peter Otto on Roszak and the counter culture, for instance, Sung on surrealism, Whitehead on the neglect of Mona Wilson—the majority remain tied to a standard version of Blake 1.0; that is, with the exception of their non-canonical material, they read as straight reception history with a soupçon of intertextuality, and might as well have been written twenty or thirty years ago. They do not “present a radical challenge to reception studies,” as the editors claim (4), because their message is wed too closely to the medium they inhabit—the codex book—and to the academic disciplinary practices the authors have internalized. It’s a bit like reading a transcript of a performance by the Rolling Stones. The collection needs (bravely, riskily) to embrace and implement the web practices it describes. But more on this later. The two essays that come closest to donning the digital mantle are Roger Whitson’s “Digital Blake 2.0” and Shirley Dent’s “‘Rob and Plunder …’: Blake and Copyright Today,” and that’s why they offer the most useful provocations in the volume.
 
Whitson’s essay contrasts the online Blake Archive with the new internet realm of what he calls “Digital Blake 2.0.” While he recognizes the enormous value and influence of the Blake Archive, he believes that its “obsessive archival focus” (42) and its emphasis on original materiality and hermeneutics limit its usefulness for the web. The archive, he argues, “has failed to inspire work that can truly take advantage of the network possibilities of online exchange” (41). Nor has it mined the internet’s creative or performative capacity. Its focus on storing data and translating Blake’s work to the web reproduces a twentieth-century methodology that is now effectively outdated.  By contrast, Digital Blake 2.0 envisions a “transformative difference” in the relationship between literature and the media, rejecting “the theory of materiality that favours originality” and “appealing to the possibilities of networking and performativity” (42). Whitson provides three examples of projects that illuminate the opportunities, challenges, and complications of Digital Blake 2.0. Guilherme Marcondes’s film short Tyger (2006) questions the very concepts of materiality and agency and explores a new form of “network materiality” (46). An online environment called Virtual Crystal Cabinet offers an interactive journey through Blake’s poem and invites fundamental questions about adaptation. And the Blake 2.0 Cloud, a riposte to the Blake Archive, conceives a new way of thinking about the poet, the academy, and the public. It embraces “the performative network model” (50) in which the scholarly remit to “filter then publish” is reversed in favor of a more egalitarian charge to publish first and fast, then filter. Rather than a “hybrid all-in-one edition” like the archive, it acts as a “hub” in collaboration with other sites and other users (50, 51).
 
While his manifesto is refreshingly pugnacious, Whitson stumbles over several key issues. Like the editors and other contributors, he takes on “the seeming monumentality of the Blake Archive” (5), though, in fairness, he does credit many of its obvious strengths. At the same time, he sees the archive as a digital dinosaur that simply mimics traditional textual scholarship online. As he says, it succumbs to “archive fever” (41), the silicon rush to translate canonical material to the web. Whitson complains that the Blake Archive is not interactive enough, fails to lend itself to collaboration or performance, and discourages public or popular participation. But the problem here is one of definition—as far as I know, the site was never intended for such purposes. It was conceived rather as a tool of accuracy and access, a scholarly edition to be sure, but one that for the first time honored Blake’s multimedia aesthetic by marrying it to a new medium. In this sense, the Blake Archive perfectly harnesses the power of the web to animate the poet’s verbal-visual plates, his experiments in copper and color. And it does so in a way that at long last does justice to Blake’s unique autographic and visual style. Given this mission, it seems unfair to speak of the archive in the same breath as creative works like Marcondes’s Tyger or the Virtual Crystal Cabinet, which primarily adapt and interpret rather than replicate Blake’s artwork.
 
I suppose, though, that the comparison of the Blake Archive with these more experimental reconfigurations of the poet’s work is symptomatic of the way that content functions on many internet sites in general, the Blake 2.0 Cloud being no exception. Posts, blogs, discussion boards, and so on tend to entangle objective and subjective views of their material, disdaining the distinction between “highbrow” and “lowbrow” as well as popular and academic subjects, championing inclusiveness, endorsing the radically egalitarian, and muddling the issues of excellence and expertise (I can hear the editors shouting the “e” word at me). At its best, a site like the Blake 2.0 Cloud is a lively online seminar that announces and discusses exciting worldwide events related to Blake; at its worst, it happily embraces the “publish then filter” mantra and becomes like a closet cluttered with old clothes. Pile after pile of old posts drift into the digital abyss, no one to read, no one daring to purge them.
 
Dent is more circumspect about the role of the Blake Archive in her essay, “‘Rob and Plunder … Translate and Copy and Buy and Sell and Criticise, but not Make’: Blake and Copyright Today” (her ellipsis). In the “cut-and-paste” culture of the web, she asks, how can we be sure that our encounter with Blake’s work is “authentic”? Whose version of Blake are we experiencing? Who controls or owns the Blake we see and how does the issue of copyright affect our experience of his poetry? As Dent rightly notes, “the question of authenticity becomes one of editorial authority” (57), and that’s why the Blake Archive again plays a crucial role in exploring these questions. Should the individual’s “freedom to innovate” trump the academic community’s “conservation of a canon” (60)? To adjudicate this debate, Dent introduces evidence from the Pre-Raphaelite revival of Blake’s works prompted by Gilchrist’s biography and Swinburne’s essay. She summons two rather unlikely witnesses, the publisher John Camden Hotten and the literary editor Richard Herne Shepherd, and they take the stand to offer opposing testimony.
 
In his book Literary Copyright (1871), Hotten makes the claim that the public rather than the author or the law should be the final arbiter of copyright, and argues for “a utilitarian, market-oriented approach to literary production” (Blake 2.0 61). An extreme example of his argument materializes in the figure of Swinburne, who in copying the final illegible lines of a scatological poem in Blake’s Notebook supplied his own verse in place of the poet’s. As Dent puts it, Swinburne “proactively changed Blake’s text” (63). Sir Geoffrey Keynes later discovered the joke and was horror struck. Like his fellow Pre-Raphaelites, Swinburne believed that textual transmission was “not about objective scholarship reaching after and bringing to light recondite manuscripts,” but rather “a question of genius calling to genius” and “recreating the text” (63). Representing the old guard, Shepherd demurred, excoriating the Pre-Raphaelites for “tampering” with Blake’s texts and destroying “the historical value of the poems” (quoted on 64-65). In the preface to his edition of The Poems of William Blake (1874), Shepherd wonders, “what protection has the reader against the caprice or vanity of an editor who does not adhere religiously to the author’s text?” (quoted on 65).
 
Dent notes the parallels with our own time in this debate and is admirably cautious about reaching any definitive conclusions. On the one hand, she agrees with the editors of the Blake Archive, who, like Shepherd, see copyright as “an important defence in preserving the integrity of Blake’s work in a digital and online environment” (64). On the other, she sympathizes with “the fast and loose attitude to copyright” that Hotten defended and that defines our own digital moment (67) and concedes that there is “just too much of a momentum to stop Blake being prey to cut-and-paste culture” (67), though the word “prey” may reveal her conservative bias here. She’s certain that “the real text still matters,” but also admits that “a serendipitous encounter” with digital or commercial Blake “might well be more authentic, have more textual integrity for a popular audience, than anything the Pre-Raphaelites could have imagined” (67).
 
And so she leaves us in a quandary. What’s an aspiring digital humanist to do—tweet, text, and tumbl in the electronic ether? Embrace mash-ups and “performativity”? How will tenure committees judge this new brand of scholarship? Will the dean smile this work to see? What becomes clear from Dent’s essay, along with several of the others, is that the new digital environment necessarily changes the activity and aims of conventional scholarly editing. The medium is not completely the message, but it radically alters it. Web editing cannot afford to mirror book editing for much longer. Soon it will not be enough for the digital humanities simply to archive a writer’s work—tag, footnote, and make it searchable. They will have to find a way of uniting the rigor and standards of the academy with the aleatory wonder of the web. In this sense, the Blake Archive probably represents the first generation of online editions. Subsequent ones may look more like the Blake 2.0 Cloud, but they will have to devise ways of navigating clutter and creating a manageable hierarchy of material if they are to maintain some degree of scholarly integrity. 
 
	The strange material fact of this book itself, optimistically titled Blake 2.0, gives rise to yet more questions and only deepens the quandary. The volume appears before us, weighty and expensive, decidedly not meant for a lay audience (only eight illustrations!), and surrounded by a host of anachronisms. There is something fundamentally counterintuitive about its very existence. Not copyright, as it turns out, but the academic tome in an age of digital reproduction ought to be the real subject of scrutiny here. What are we to make of a twenty-first century debate housed in the hoary tabernacle of the past? Doesn’t the old Gutenberg technology invalidate, or at least subvert, many of the arguments being made in the collection? Why weren’t these essays published online with links to Blake blogs, other online essay collections, and social networking sites? Was it the whisper of permanence that still beckons from the codex form, the imprimatur of a worthy press, the satisfying comfort of a book on the shelf?
 
These questions perforce lead to the most disturbing of all. When he proclaimed “The Death of the Author” many years ago now, Roland Barthes never imagined that it would happen quite so literally as it has. On the web, “network materiality” presupposes or portends, in ways that are still evolving, a concomitant “network immateriality” of the author, whose identity is not only masked behind PINs and passwords but subsumed in a complex of “relations.” Because of continual updating, new and multiple alliances, and the vexed status of copyright, the primary focus of the web has become the site rather than the author or authors behind it. Thus the Blake 2.0 Cloud, like some relative of HAL, will soon replace Whittaker and Whitson as the living digital progenitor. And that’s why these essays, with their identifiable authors, standard page lengths, and rumble of footnotes seem oddly reactionary, an atavistic cry of “mine.” They pledge allegiance to what L. O. Sauerberg has suggestively called the “Gutenberg Parenthesis,” the five-hundred-year pause that interrupts a discernible continuum between the Elizabethan world of performance and re-creation and our own digital culture, which is increasingly defined by oral and communal traditions as well as transmedial forms of communication. Web 2.0 implies a sense of transience and flux that produces terrible anxiety in many academics. There is no inscription, no name on the title page, no sweet-savored legacy. Everybody’s on the masthead and Nobodaddy. And so the forces of the internet appear to foretell a much more disquieting “Death of the Author,” especially for those of us still chiseling away at the little monument of our name.

William Blake and His Circle: A Checklist of Publications and Discoveries in 2013
 
By G. E. Bentley, Jr.  with the assistance of Hikari Sato  for Japanese publications and of Fernando Castanedo for Spanish publications
 
G. E. Bentley, Jr. (gbentley@chass.utoronto.ca) is trying to learn how to recognize the many styles of handwriting of a professional calligrapher like Blake, who used four distinct hands in The Four Zoas.
 
Editors’ notes: The invaluable Bentley checklist has grown to the point where we are unable to publish it in its entirety. All the material will be incorporated into the cumulative “William Blake and His Circle” and “Sale Catalogues of William Blake’s Works” on the Bentley Blake Collection site, Victoria University in the University of Toronto. The article below includes previously unrecorded copy, binding, and history information for the works of Blake and his circle, catalogues and editions from the last ten years (2004 on), and criticism from the last ten years and prior to the publication of Gilchrist’s Life (1863).
 
A number of entries below have a link to an online article or catalogue. Some items are freely accessible and others may be behind a subscription barrier, depending on your or your institution’s access. All are included on the grounds that even those with restricted access often provide a freely available abstract or excerpt.
 
Addenda and corrigenda to Blake Records, 2nd ed. (2004), now appear online. They are updated yearly in conjunction with the publication of the checklist.

Blake Publications and Discoveries in 2013
  
The checklist of Blake publications recorded in 2013 includes works in French, German, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, and Ukrainian, and there are doctoral dissertations from Birmingham, Cambridge, City University of New York, Florida State, Hiroshima, Maryland, Northwestern, Oxford, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Voronezh State, and Wrocław. The Folio Society facsimile of Blake’s designs for Gray’s Poems and the detailed records of “Sale Catalogues of Blake’s Works 1791-2013” are likely to prove to be among the most lastingly valuable of the works listed.
 
Gallica
 
A wonderful resource new to me is Gallica, the digital library of the Bibliothèque nationale de France, which reproduces over 2,000,000 searchable documents. For works in French it is invaluable.
 
Free Library of Philadelphia and Rosenbach Museum
 
According to an online press release of 17 April 2013, the “Free Library of Philadelphia Foundation and the Rosenbach Museum and Library announce intent to join forces to create nation’s preeminent rare book collection,” “the Rosenbach of the Free Library of Philadelphia Foundation.” The Rosenbach Library has Descriptive Catalogue (M), For the Sexes (E), Poetical Sketches (R), and Visions of the Daughters of Albion (H), plus loose Blake prints, while the Free Library of Philadelphia has numerous books with Blake’s commercial engravings.
 
Curiosa
 
The online Gravestone Photographic Resource includes the gravestone in Bunhill Fields of William and Catherine Blake.
 
Blake’s Writings
 
Newly Recorded Works
 
Songs (CC, q) are identified here for the first time.
 
Blake Fingerprints
 
There are many fingerprints on top of the writing in the edition of Thomas Gray’s Poems (1790) that was inset into Blake’s watercolor illustrations for Gray (see Inscriptions on Designs in Part I). Some are admirably clear (see illus. 1).
 
The date at which the fingerprints appeared must be after c. 1797, when Blake made his watercolors for Gray. Of course we cannot be certain that the prints that appear near “William Blake” in his poem “To Mrs. Ann Flaxman” are those of the poet-artist. They could, for example, be those of Catherine Blake, who, it is believed, often helped her husband with simple tasks such as gluing the printed leaves of Gray into the windows cut in the paper used for the watercolors.The leaves for Blake’s watercolors (1795-96) illustrating Young’s Night Thoughts were made in a way very similar to that used in the illustrations for Gray’s Poems. The printed leaf was cut from the host volume (often eliminating or curtailing catchwords and ms. line numbers) and glued to a window cut in the leaf for the watercolor, and a red line was meticulously drawn round the cut-out leaf, with several red lines on title pages. However, the Night Thoughts leaves bear no fingerprints. Apparently the large leaves already had printed text mounted in them when they were given to Blake. Whether the fingerprints are those of Blake or his wife, they give an extraordinary sense of immediacy in the creative process.
 
Commercial Engravings
 
Job proofs are newly identified here. An exciting “new” Blake was the copy of Blair’s Grave (1813), with coloring attributed to William Blake by Martin Butlin, that appeared in the Vershbow sale of 29 October 2013. The copy had been previously described but not reproduced.
 
One of the most curious Blake productions of this or any other year is the copy of Blair’s Grave (1813) that was extra-illustrated by Blake’s acquaintance William Thane with a pastiche of images from Young’s Night Thoughts (see illus. 2-4).
 
A proof of Blake’s unpublished self-portrait of George Romney for Hayley’s Romney (1809) was acquired by Robert N. Essick. Only one copy has been recorded, and then lost,Philadelphia Blake exhibition (1939), lot 104. The print was loaned by Rosenwald but has not been traced among the Blakes he gave to the Library of Congress and the US National Gallery. since Blake described it in his letters of 1803 and 1804.
 
A new owner is recorded for a colored copy (V) of Young’s Night Thoughts (1797).
 
Criticism, Biography, and Scholarship
 
One of the most curious discoveries here is Miss Louisa Lane’s poem about “The Last Scene in Blake’s Life,” published in the Guernsey and Jersey Magazine (1838). This is the only known connection of Blake with the Channel Islands and the only known drama-fragment about Blake.
 
Blake’s Circle
 
Important new details are provided for George Cumberland, including the first publication of his farce The Emigrants, ed. Elizabeth B. Bentley (2013), John Linnell, including writings and drawings, A. S. Mathew (his will), and Charles Augustus Tulk (his album, with drawings by Blake and Flaxman).
 
* * * * * * * * *
 
The annual checklist of scholarship and discoveries concerning William Blake and his circle records publications and discoveries for the current year (say, 2013) and those for previous years that are not recorded in Blake Books, Blake Books Supplement, and “William Blake and His Circle.” Installments of “William Blake and His Circle” are continuations of Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement, with similar principles and conventions.
 
I have made no systematic attempt to record audio books and magazines, blogs, broadcasts on radio and television, calendars, CD-ROMs, chinaware, coffee mugs, comic books, computer printouts (unpublished), conferences, DVDs, electronic editions of works by Blake, e-mails, festivals and lecture series, flash cards, furniture, interactive multimedia, jewelry, lectures on audiocassettes, lipstick, manuscripts about Blake, microforms, mosaics, movies,See Aethelred the Unready, a short documentary (2012) on Aethelred Eldridge in honor of his receiving emeritus status from Ohio University. murals, music, notebooks (blank), novels merely tangentially about Blake, pageants, performances, pillows, places named after Blake, playing cards, plays, podcasts, poems about Blake, portraits, postcards, posters and individual pictures, recorded readings and singings, refrigerator magnets, stained-glass windows, stamps (postage and rubber), stickers, sweatshirts, tapestries,See Anon., “Theatre: Blake Remembered at West Dean [College],” in Part VI. T-shirts, tattoos (temporary and permanent), tiles, typescripts (unpublished), video recordings, and web sites.
 
I take Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement, faute de mieux, to be the standard bibliographical books on Blake,Except for the states of the prints for Blake’s commercial book engravings, where the standard authority is Robert N. Essick, William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991). Significant further details, especially about collations, are given in Roger R. Easson and Essick, William Blake Book Illustrator: A Bibliography and Catalogue of the Commercial Engravings, vol. 1: Plates Designed and Engraved by Blake (Normal: American Blake Foundation, 1972); vol. 2: Plates Designed or Engraved by Blake 1774-1796 (Memphis: American Blake Foundation, 1979); vol. 3 never appeared. The standard authority for Blake prints issued separately is Essick, The Separate Plates of William Blake: A Catalogue (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983). and have noted significant differences from them. The organization of Division I of the checklist is as in Blake Books. In Part VI: Criticism, Biography, and Scholarly Studies, collections of essays on Blake are listed under the names of the editors, and issues of periodicals devoted extensively to him are listed under the titles. Reviews, listed here under the book reviewed, are only for works which are chiefly about Blake, not for those with only, say, a chapter on Blake. Note that Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement normally do not include reviews. Division II: Blake’s Circle is organized by individual (say, William Hayley or John Flaxman), with works by and about Blake’s friends and patrons, living individuals with whom he had significant direct and demonstrable contact. It does not include important contemporaries with whom Blake’s contact was negligible or nonexistent, such as John Constable and William Wordsworth and Edmund Burke. There is nothing in Blake Books and Blake Books Supplement corresponding to Division II.
 
Research for this checklist was carried out particularly in the libraries of the University of Toronto and Victoria University in the University of Toronto, as well as with the electronic resources of Copac, Google, Google Books, Google Scholar, and WorldCat. Works published in Japan were found in CiNii (National Institute of Informatics Scholarly and Academic Information Navigator), the National Diet Library online catalogue, Komaba Library and the General Library of the University of Tokyo, and the National Diet Library.
 
I should be most grateful to anyone who can help me to better information about the unseen (§) items reported here, and I undertake to thank them prettily in person and in print.
 
I am deeply grateful to Sarah Bentley (for transliterations from Russian), Fernando Castanedo (for works in Spanish), Robert N. Essick (especially for records of Quaritch catalogues and an early sight of his “Blake in the Marketplace, 2013”), Alexander Gourlay, Heather Jackson, Mary Lynn Johnson, Sarah Jones, Jeff Mertz (for reproductions of scores of works on Blake), Rachel Kahan Noyce, Hikari Sato (for publications in Japanese), and V. V. Serdechnaya (for works in Russian).

Inscriptions on Designs
  
Designs (1797) for Gray, Poems (1790) BB p. 216﻿
 Fingerprints:The only previous reference to Blake fingerprints I have found is in BB p. 217, which locates them on the Gray title page, pp. 58, 158, “and occasionally elsewhere.” There are brownish-rust fingerprints, perhaps made from animal glue, on the text (never on the watercolors): The title page, above, below, and to the right of “A NEW EDITION” Gray p. 58: “Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College,” after “ſee, how all around ’em wait” Gray p. [62]: Captions for “A Long Story,” beneath “riding on Flies” Gray p. [76]: Captions for “Ode to Adversity,” above “thy suppliants” Gray p. [107]: Title page for “The Fatal Sisters,” over “Orcades” Gray p. [158]: Poem “To Mrs. Ann Flaxman,” above and below “William Blake,” four fingers of the right(?) hand, the clearest of them all (see illus. 1).

  
 
1. Four clear fingerprints are visible on Blake’s poem to Ann Flaxman on text p. [158] of Gray’s Poems (1790) with watercolors by Blake (see enlargement of text area). Yale Center for British Art, Paul Mellon Collection. B1992.8.11(58). The color apparently consists of glue made from animal matter. The prints are on top of the writing and were almost certainly added when the leaves for the printed text were glued into windows cut in the far larger leaves that carry Blake’s watercolor illustrations. This means that they were probably made by William or Catherine Blake. More fingerprints are faintly visible on other Gray pages, but no Blake fingerprint from elsewhere has been identified.

  
In some, probably most, cases, Blake’s writing on blank text pages was added after the watercolor for that page was completed. On p. [54], the list of designs overflows the text box, and nos. 8-10 are on the leaf for the watercolor. In this case, at any rate, the watercolor preceded the list of designs. 
 
On p. [158], Blake wrote the poem to Mrs. Flaxman on the blank verso of the printed text box, then glue fingerprints were left on top of the manuscript poem, probably in the process of gluing the printed leaves onto the windows of the large leaves for the watercolors. In this case, the manuscript probably preceded the watercolor.

See “Blake in the Marketplace, 2013,” Blake 47.4 (spring 2014): illus. 1-2, where the prints are described minutely. on the recto and verso of a leaf 11.7 x 16.0 cm., printed probably about 1790 in reddish brown (pl. 5)Not “sepia” as in BB p. 287. Marriage copy B pls. 1, 3, 6, 8-9, 12, 14-15, 18-19, 22-23, 26-27 were also printed (?in 1790) in reddish brown, as were pls. 1-9, 12, 14-15, 18-19, 22-23, 25-27 in copy H and all of copy G (watermarked 1815). and red (pl. 6); Essick writes: “Neither [Joseph] Viscomi nor I have been able to find a close match for the red ink of this impression among Blake’s other printings of Marriage pls. datable to c. 1790.” pl. 5 has blue wash for sky behind the falling man and horse. Watermark: Wove paper without watermark. Binding: The leaf is mounted on an unwatermarked leaf (23.8 x 31.2 cm.), with a brown line boxing pl. 5. At the top right of the mount of pl. 5 is written “90” in pen and brown ink. The host-leaf and number were probably added “about 1853” (BB p. 337) by George A. Smith. The mount was stabbed at least twice; it has eight stabholes and a set of eighteen smaller holes. In pencil below pl. 5 is “from Marriage of Heaven and Hell page 5” and on the verso in the same hand “Heaven and Hell page 6.” The leaf with pls. 5-6 was acquired in a frame with glass on both sides, but the glass was removed by Essick.

Joseph Knight wrote to Swinburne on 9 Feb. 1865: “My friend Purnell can lend you the volume of Blake you require. … I will call on Sunday afternoon for the M.S.” (1: 31). It isn’t clear whether the “volume of Blake” is the same as the “M.S.” Swinburne’s friend Thomas Purnell (1834-89) is not recorded in BB, BBS, Blake, BR(2), or Butlin. … offered by Quaritch in catalogues No. 243 (Oct. 1905), lot 180 (£125), and No. 271 (Jan. 1909), lot 194 (£50), each described as “About 1790,” “neatly written in a small hand on 8 leaves; with the original blue paper wrapper,” “the inscription on … the original blue paper cover, ‘Tiriel, MS. by Mr. Blake’ is in Blake’s own handwriting,” “The handwriting is the same, though the pen with which the last part is written is somewhat finer.”

Smaller Blake-Varley Sketchbook (1819)
 
A separate leafThere are slightly disfiguring oil stains in the paper, which could have come from a book or piece of wood resting on it. ﻿Butlin #692 53-54 [Two Visionary Figures, Mountains Behind]﻿ was sold at Christie’s, 15 June 1971, lot 157 [£157.15.0 to “Hearson” (i.e., Pearson) for Anchard Fine Arts Ltd]. It was sold again at Christie’s (New York), 31 January 2013, lot 147 (see 2013 31 January in Part IV).
 
The design represents an angel with arms and wings upraised standing before a man who is pointing to our right. Surrounding the head of the pointing man is a large circle, perhaps representing a halo or the sun, and in the background are three pyramid-shaped objects.
 
The verso is inscribed by Varley “it is allways [sic] to keep yourself collected”, and, according to Butlin #692 53, the recto is “inscr. by Varley … ’Hotspur …’, the rest illegible, apparently on four lines below drawing.”Butlin tells me in an e-mail of March 2013 that the Hotspur inscription was still legible when he saw it in 2012. Neither I nor several advisors using raking light and magnifying glasses of various powers could find where the writing is supposed to be, much less read it. It is difficult to relate the design or the words to Henry Percy (1364–1403), son of the Earl of Northumberland, who was killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury (see Shakespeare’s Henry IV, Part 1). Blake made a separate visionary head of Hotspur ﻿Butlin #745﻿, which is visually unrelated to this drawing. And in the same Blake-Varley sketchbook ﻿Butlin #692 131﻿ is a drawing unrelated to Hotspur inscribed “Hotspur said … we shou[l]d have had the Battle had it not been for those cursed Stars[.] Hotspur Said he was indignant to have been killed by … such a Person as Prince Henry who was so much his inferior” (BR[2] 368).

It lacks some hatching strokes but has “a small patch of hatching on the central extension of the counsellor’s beard” not present in later states; it was “probably burnished off the pl.”Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2013,” Blake 47.4 (spring 2014), gives a detailed description of the unique features of the proof.
 
William Thane’s Copy of The Grave
  
A copy (1813) in the Library of Congress PR3318.B7 A7 1813, Rosenwald Collection. To view the entire work, see http://​hdl.​loc.​gov/​loc.​rbc/​Rosenwald.​1827.1. Illus. 2-4 here are images 12, 13, and 132. is extra-illustrated with designs cut from Young, Night Thoughts (1797). The Night Thoughts prints are slightly larger than those in The Grave, and therefore the full-page designs were trimmed in both dimensions, including the imprint. Occasionally an attempt is made to repeat motifs in the illustrations to The Grave with facing prints from Night Thoughts (see illus. 2-3). Sometimes it is difficult to perceive a controlling motif (see illus. 4).
 
 
2. Blair’s Grave (1813) extra-illustrated with prints from Young’s Night Thoughts (1797) p. 19 (trumpeter plunging to skeleton), p. 46 (nude woman gesturing), and p. 43 (woman with stars in her hair). The page carefully echoes the engraved title page of Blair’s Grave (1808), which faces it (illus. 3). Library of Congress, Rosenwald Collection.

The Night Thoughts cuttings are from p. 87 (in center, Christ with children), p. 31 (at right, man in chair beneath floating woman), p. 4 (on left, man in woods), p. 49 (above him, head of curly-haired man), p. 15 (above him, floating figure reoriented from almost vertical to horizontal), and p. 75 (at top right, figure reoriented). It is difficult to find a common theme in these images. Library of Congress, Rosenwald Collection.

 Binding: Originally in blue paper wrappers (only the back one survives); bound (post-1929) in modern red morocco with marbled endpapers at front and back. History: Assembled by William Thane—the back blue paper cover is inscribed “This book was given to me by Mṛ Wṃ Thane the picture restorer with the additional slips pasted in—just as it is—Mṛ Thane knew Blake—”; sold in The Library of John Quinn, Anderson Galleries, 12-14 November 1923, lot 716 [for $95] to Rosenbach, who sold it on 3 May 1929 for $1200 to Lessing J.

Kathryn Barush reports nine previously unrecorded loose copies of Blair prints in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford,They are not listed in the catalogue of the Douce bequest to the Bodleian Library (1840). Their discovery is reported by Kathryn Barush, “Visions of Mortality” (see Barush in Part VI), which reproduces nos. 1, 3, 5, 8-9 on a greatly reduced scale, but not the proof of no. 10 (“The Death of the Good Old Man”). Another proof of no. 10 is in the collection of Robert N. Essick. The presence of pencil prices of “2/” on no. 1 and “3/6” on nos. 5, 8, and the facts that “the matting, quality and size of the prints vary, suggest … that they were assembled separately” (Barush 60). consisting of pls. 1. Title page, proof, with the Douce Collection stamp.“Douce Collection, Un[iversity] Ox[ford].” 3. “The Meeting of a Family in Heaven” with the Douce Collection stamp. 4. “The Counseller, King, Warrior, Mother and Child, in the Tomb.” 5. “Death of the Strong Wicked Man” with the Douce Collection stamp. 7. “The Descent of Man into the Vale of Death.” 8. “The Day of Judgment” with the Douce Collection stamp. 9. “The Soul Exploring the Recesses of the Grave.” 10. “The Death of the Good Old Man,” “an untitled proof copy, before the final lettering.” 11. “Death’s Door.” The print of the title page displays, at the bottom-right corner, the etched legend “Proof Copy R.H.C.

Scott, John, Poetical Works (1782, 1786, 1795)
 
Quaritch catalogue No. 539 (1937), lot 432, remarks:
  It has not, we believe, been noted before that two variants exist of the 1782 edition. In Variant A, presumably the earlier, the verso of leaf A4 is occupied by 15 lines of Errata. In Variant B this leaf is blank and the errata, with one exception, are corrected in the text. Although the setting up of the variants corresponds, page for page, the pagination differs, owing to a fly-title to the Elegies being present in Variant B, but not in A. This conclusion is summarized in Quaritch catalogue No. 979 (1977), lot 50.

A booklet to accompany the exhibition, curated by Stella Halkyard, at the John Rylands Library, University of Manchester. According to Burning Bright, the undertaking was a project for the students of Colin Trodd. There is no list of what was exhibited. There is some éclat about the statement that “many of these works have previously lain undetected” (4). Their obscurity to the students may be explained in part by the fact that the section on “Further Reading and Resources” omits Roger R. Easson and Robert N. Essick, William Blake Book Illustrator, Essick, William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations, BB, BBS, and “William Blake and His Circle” (Blake), which record the Manchester works reproduced here.

A brief summary of Blake’s life (70-71), silently paraphrased and quoted from Cunningham,“at ten years of age he became an artist, and at twelve a poet” (Cunningham  ¶3, Lane p. 70); “she [Kate] seemed to have been created on purpose for Blake” (Cunningham ¶10, Lane p. 70); “to the wildest flights of his imagination she bowed the knee” (Cunningham ¶10, Lane p. 71). Lane quotes (71) somewhat approximately from Cunningham ¶47-48. serves as an introduction to “The Last Scene in Blake’s Life” (71-75) in blank verse.
 Solitude—loneliness I never knew; the midnight’s solemn hour Was fraught with phantoms of the mighty dead, And, shaking off the fears of weak mortality, I conversed with them—man to man; My spirit walked with theirs through the wide world; They taught the mysteries of my noble art, The secrets of the dead, and made them mine. Heroes and sages, patriarchs of old, And fallen angels with their faded light, E’en yet too dazzling for a mortal’s eye, Came as familiar things …. (73) 
This is the only known dramatic extract based on Blake.
 
Louisa Lane (1812-83), daughter of Major-General Ambrose Lane and Mary Le Meurier, married the Rev. Thomas Clarke and lived in his parish of Wood Eaton, Oxfordshire, until his death in 1865. She then returned to Guernsey. She published extensively under her married name about the natural history and folklore of the Channel Islands (e.g., Folk-Lore of Guernsey and Sark [1880]).See Edgar MacCulloch, Guernsey Folk Lore, ed. Edith Carey (London: Elliot Stock; Guernsey: F. Clarke, 1903).

There are occasional references to Blake, chiefly to Swinburne’s own book (1868). Of these, the most important are Swinburne’s letter of 13 Oct. 1864 about Tiriel (see Tiriel in Part I, Section A) and the letter from Francis Cunningham (the son of Allan Cunningham, Blake’s biographer) to Swinburne (3 Nov. 1866), enclosing an
 extract of a letter from Etty the Painter to Campbell the Poet …. The fact mentioned in it has not been noticed by any of Blake’s biographers, and is so honorable to Lawrence’s memory that I hope you will deem it important enough for an allusion in your book (1: 81-82). Etty’s letter of 25 March 1830 (not with Cunningham’s) about Lawrence’s gift of £100 to Blake is given in BR(2) 525; it was first recorded by Robert N. Essick, “William Blake and Sir Thomas Lawrence,” Notes and Queries 223 (1978): 211-13. 
In the same letter, Cunningham says that he owns the drawings by Blake, Rossetti catalogue [1863] 242, nos. 22-23, the “Last Judgment” and a tracing of it (1: 82). Rossetti no. 22 is The Last Judgment ﻿Butlin #644﻿, sold by Tatham, Sotheby’s, 29 April 1862, lot 179, to Palser; Alfred Aspland owned it by 1876 and sold it at Sotheby’s, 27 Jan. 1885, lot 64. Rossetti no. 23 is The Last Judgment—Tracing ﻿#646﻿, sold with Rossetti no. 22 in the 1862 sale, lot 179, to Palser, and owned by Mrs. Gilchrist in 1880.

In his “Foreword” (vii-x), Butlin says that he has altered the references to Blake’s writings from the edition of Geoffrey Keynes to that of David V. Erdman, and the references to contemporary texts to G. E. Bentley, Jr., Blake Records, 2nd ed. (2004), that he has given more accessible references to reproductions of Blake’s art than in the 1971 edition, and that he has added footnotes signed “M.B.,” a “List of Works Cited” (203-05), and “Supplementary Bibliography” (206-07). “Irene Tayler’s text is still the most satisfactory introduction to the subtleties of Blake’s illustrations to the poems of Gray” (ix).

The E. J. Pratt Library of Victoria University in the University of Toronto acquired in 2013 a newly discovered pretty little metal box (17.5 x 11.3 cm.) shaped like a book, with gilt edges, clasps, and decorated covers, the spine of tooled leather. The front cover has an octagonal mother-of-pearl surface decorated with flowers (some rust stains). The front and back inner boards are white watered silk with gilt dentelles with a white watered-silk pull.
 
Inside the box is a white watered-silk folder containing six leaves (the last two from a larger leaf folded in two) gilt on all four edges, watermarked “J Wh | 18” on the folded leaf and “and Son | 0” on leaf 4.

Victoria University in the University of Toronto. Inside the box is a portrait by John Linnell of Robert Gooch, a sketch of Bedgellert by John Varley, a description by Gooch of “A Dream” about a skeleton, and an account by Gooch of going round the wards of the hospital at Yarmouth with Nelson after the Battle of Copenhagen.
 
  
The leaves include:
 1. A sketch inscribed in pencil at the bottom “This shall be improved another time” and, on the verso in ink: This Portrait of Robert Gooch. M.D. to accompany the account of his Dream. Drawn by John Linnell from the Picture painted by him from the life. for Sir Wṃ KnightonOn 20 June 1827 Linnell sent a copy of Blake’s Job to the king for £10.10.0 by order of Dr. Gooch and Sir William Knighton (BR[2] 801). to whose Daughter this scetch [sic] is sent as a token of thanks for the very patient sittings during the painting of her Portrait | April 1827 | 6. Cirencester Place | Fitzroy Sqr | — 2. A very simple sketch of a bridge called “Bedgellert | an account of a Dream connected with the above view will be given at another period | J. Varley.” 3. On the double leaf is written: A Dream It is well known that the last Thought in the mind on going to Sleep often suggests the dream of the Night. From 15 to 21 years of age I lived with a Surgeon at Yarmouth on the Coast of Norfolk. My Bed Room was at the top of the House and over looked the Sea, only a quarter of a Mile distant. A Skeleton in a tall box hung at my Bed’s foot, and in the Day when I had nothing else to do I used to go up to my bed Room—take down the Skeleton[,] seat him in a chair and taking a seat near him with Cheselden’s anatomy before me, learn the Bones. For some Time I used to approach this silent Personage with something very like Fear—I liked to have a third Person in the Room with me—it was a long time before I became perfectly indifferent about these silent tetes-a-tetes.—One night in August I went up stairs to Bed at the usual hour. It was very sultry weather and bright moonlight, and after undreſsing I stood for a long time looking out of the chamber window on the moon light Seda, watching the white Sails which every now and then paſsed. At length I got into Bed. The moon shone bright into my Room and was reflected from the white wall on the wainscoat Door which inclosed the mysterious companion of my daily studies, but at this moment the thought of him was not quite agreable. I tried to forget him[,] I shut my Eyes, and endeavoured to go to Sleep. How long I had been doing this—whether I was asleep or awake or between both I know not, but I distinctly felt—distinctly as if it had been real—a pair of cold, hard, bony hands grasp my ankles and pull me down the Bed. For a minute or two I became breathleſs almost senseleſs: when I came to myself sufficiently I began to observe the posture in which I was lying[.] The pull was so violent that if it had been real, it must have dragged me half out of bed, but I found myself lying with my head on my pillow just as I had laid myself down to sleep and this is now the only proof I have that it was not a reality but a Dream. Robert Gooch Nelson After the Battle of Copenhagen, Nelson sent his wounded Seamen to the naval Hospital at Yarmouth, and a week afterwards came into the Road himself. His arrival was soon known throughout the Town. The Military was drawn up in the market Place to receive the Hero, and when he landed on the Jetty he was met by the Populace with Shouts, but the first thing he did was to go straight to the Hospital. Happening to be there when Nelson arrived I went round the wards with him and was much struck by his behaviour to the Sailors. He stopped at every Bed and to every Man had something kind and cheering to say. One Man had lost his right arm close to the Shoulder—the same arm which Nelson himself had lost. With this man he talked several minutes. “Well Jack what’s the matter with you?” “Lost my right arm your Honour[.]” On hearing this Nelson paused—looked down at his own empty sleeve—then at the Sailor—“Well Jack then you and I are in the same plight—spoiled for Fishermen—that’s all—cheer up my brave fellow[”]: he hurried on to the next bed, but these few words had a magical effect, for as I turned away I saw the Sailor’s face brighten up. It was by such things as these that Nelson gained the hearts as well as the confidence of his Crews. R G  
Mathew, Anthony Stephen (1733–1824)
 
Clergyman and patron of Blake
 
The “last Will and Testament of me Anthony Stephen Mathew of Ruſsell place in the parish of St. pancras in the County of Middlesex Clerk”“Clerk” is made explicit in the marginal note: “The Revd Anthony Stephen Mathew”. was written on 28 January 1818, with codicils of 23 February 1819 and 14 December 1822, and proved on 22 November 1824. In it he
 give[s] unto my Son William Henry the ground rents of four houses in upper Titchfield Street in the parish of Marybone Middlesex … my ground rents on five houses in Howland Street and one house and workshop yard in Cleveland Street in the parish of Saint pancras Middx … [and] 5 houses in york Street Marybone … and … the residue of my substance … in money or … annuities or any other Government stock whether in … Jewels plate books paintings and all other … property “and after his decease to his wife Dorothea.”Prerogative Court of Canterbury, PROB 11/1692/230, in the National Archives. Note that the hand that transcribed the wills gives “e” for “and”; I have substituted “and” for this “e”. William Henry Mathew (born 1769) was a surgeon. The lack of reference to A. S. Mathew’s wife, Harriet, suggests that she had died before 28 January 1818. 
These fifteen houses plus a “workshop yard” suggest considerable prosperity. There is no indication as to whether his “books paintings” included any by his sometime protégé William Blake. None has ever been traced to him, not even the Poetical Sketches (1783), the printing of which Anthony Stephen Mathew partly paid for.

Tulk Album of Drawings
 Description:The details here derive from Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2012,” Blake 46.4 (spring 2013), and from the Libson catalogue (see 2013 [January] in Part IV). The album contained 90 pp.; old master drawings, drawings by Flaxman, and two leaves with drawings by Blake. 
One of the Blake drawings is a watercolor of an aged couple at the left embracing a boy and a girlLibson calls it The Meeting of a Family in Heaven, the title of a design (1805) for Blair’s Grave (1808), but the two designs are dissimilar, and Essick points out that the setting is distinctly terrestrial. The leaf in the album to which the drawing was attached was inscribed in pencil “Parents meeting” (Essick). It is based on a drawing (1790-92) in Blake’s Notebook, p. 41 (as Essick points out). in front of gothic columns, with a very rough pencil sketch on the verso called by Lowell Libson Sisyphus Rolling the Stone Up a Hill.
 
The other Blake leaf is of a seated middle-aged couple playing harps.Libson relates them to the harpers in Job (1826) pl. “21”; on the composition, see also Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2012,” Blake 46.4 (spring 2013): illus. 9, and Martin Butlin, “Harpers and Other Drawings: The Case for a Unified Composition,” Blake 47.2 (fall 2013). To their left is a naked young man leaning on a shovel who is “almost identical” to the grave-digger on the general title page for his watercolors (1795-97) for Young, Night Thoughts ﻿Butlin #330 2﻿ (as Essick points out), and above them are two floating figuresThey are similar to the flying angels at the top of the title page of Night I ﻿Butlin #330 6﻿ of Night Thoughts, as Essick points out. who seem to be pouring out something. On the verso is a series of disparate studies (reversed) for America (1793) and Europe (1794).
 Sizes: The album mounts are 27 x 22 cm.; Blake’s drawings are 9.2 x 14.3 cm. (the aged couple) and 24.6 x 20.4 cm. (the harp players). Watermark: Whatman paper mounts in the album. Binding: Bound in calf. History: See the provenance in Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2012,” Blake 46.4 (spring 2013): illus. 12.

Inscriptions by Blake for His Designs
 
By G. E. Bentley, Jr.
 
G. E. Bentley, Jr. (gbentley@chass.utoronto.ca) published William Blake in the Desolate Market (McGill–Queen’s University Press, 2014) and added 550 pages to the online “Sale Catalogues of Blake’s Works, 1791-2014.”
 
Editors’ note: Wherever possible we have included a link to the design. In some cases the inscription is not visible on the image, e.g., if the writing is on the verso or the image has been cropped to the design.
 
 
 
Blake often wrote inscriptions on his designs, but only the most important have been recorded in comprehensive editions of his writings.Geoffrey Keynes, ed., The Writings of William Blake (London: Nonesuch Press, 1925 ff.), David V. Erdman, ed., The Poetry and Prose of William Blake (Garden City: Doubleday, 1965 ff.), and G. E. Bentley, Jr., ed., William Blake’s Writings (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978) 1323-45 (notes on 1735-42). Many are also recorded in Bentley, Blake Books (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977) 210-21. Note that this essay does not include marginalia in books, which are quite fully recorded (e.g., William Blake’s Writings 1349-518), or Blake’s descriptions of designs in his letters (e.g., the account of “The Last Judgment” in his letter of 18 Jan. 1808 [copied twice]). A good many seem never to have been recorded in editions of Blake’s writings or in concordances of them. Some are brief titles, such as “Pestilence” and “Nimrod.” Some are part of the design, such as “MENE TEK,” “ΠAPIS,” and “Elizabeth Rex.” Often they identify the scene illustrated, as in the separate descriptions of the designs for the poems of Gray and Milton. A few are in Greek, Hebrew, Italian, or Latin.
 
Occasionally, what is not written is as interesting as what is written. Thus in Blake’s transcription of Genesis, he twice omitted “and God saw that it was good” (1.18, 25), and in “the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him” (4.15), he omitted “lest any finding him should kill him.”
 
Because these inscriptions are little known, it seems worthwhile to record here as many of them as possible. The information derives chiefly from Martin Butlin, The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake (1981). For inscriptions within the drawing, the source is Butlin vol. 2: Plates; for inscriptions outside the picture, the source is Butlin vol. 1: Text. The numbers within angle brackets and the dates derive from Butlin.
 
The visionary heads were drawn chiefly in the Folio Blake-Varley Sketchbook, the Large Blake-Varley Sketchbook, and the Small Blake-Varley Sketchbook.Until the rediscovery of the Large Blake-Varley Sketchbook, the Small Blake-Varley Sketchbook was known merely as the Blake-Varley Sketchbook. The first and third have been broken up, but the drawings are recorded in Butlin. The Large Blake-Varley Sketchbook survives pretty much intact, but it was rediscovered only in 1989, too late for Butlin.The inscriptions in the Large Blake-Varley Sketchbook are recorded in the Christie’s (London) catalogue of 21 March 1989 and in Bentley, Blake Books Supplement (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995) 179-180.
 
Blake’s transcriptions of Milton for his six designs for On the Morning of Christ’s Nativity (Butts set, 1815) and “the artist’s descriptions” of the Butts series of designs for Comus (1815) have not been traced since their sales at Sotheby’s, 26 March 1852, lot 147, and Foster’s, 29 June 1853, lot 98. The “descriptive Paper” which, according to her letter of 4 August 1829, Catherine Blake delivered to Lord Egremont with Blake’s “Picture of Spenser’s Fairy Queen,” has also disappeared.
 
Indirect Inscriptions
 
The titles of the works that Blake exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780 ﻿#60﻿, 1784 ﻿#187-88﻿, 1785 ﻿#155-57, 160﻿, 1799 ﻿#424﻿, 1800 ﻿#416﻿, and 1808 ﻿#438, 500, 642﻿, at his own exhibition in 1809-10 ﻿#69, 438, 456, 495, 500, 649, 651, 653, 655, 657-61, 663-64﻿, and at the exhibition of the Associated Painters in Water-Colours in 1812 ﻿#649, 651, 653﻿ were clearly supplied by Blake (those for his own exhibition in his Descriptive Catalogue [1809]).
 
Blake’s biblical watercolors for Butts often had extensive inscriptions on the mounts in a copperplate hand. However, they cannot have been written by the Blakes, for the inscriptions are on cards of a type not produced before 1846.Joyce H. Townsend, Robin Hamlyn, and John Anderson, “The Presentation of Blake’s Paintings,” William Blake: The Painter at Work, ed. Joyce H. Townsend (London: Tate Publishing, 2003) 168.
 
The extensive inscriptions on Blake’s engravings for Illustrations of the Book of Job (1826) are included, though most of them are quotations from the Bible.
 
The titles of the designs (1805) for Robert Blair, The Grave (1808),See Bentley, Blake Records, 2nd ed. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) 217-18. are likely to have derived at least in part from Blake.
 
John Varley’s inscriptions on the visionary heads that he watched Blake draw in 1819 almost certainly derived from what Blake told him at the time and are listed here as if Blake had made them.I except “These are heads he used to see of deceased worthies in vision” (Five Visionary Heads of Women [1819-20] ﻿#765﻿) because it does not seem to quote Blake. Note that A Fiend ﻿#762﻿, Herod ﻿#706﻿, Pindar as He Stood a Conqueror in the Olympic Games ﻿#710﻿, and The Task-Master Whom Moses Slew in Egypt are known chiefly or entirely from descriptions of them by Varley to Cunningham ¶38. See, for instance, Varley’s tracing of The Egyptian Taskmaster Killed by Moses ﻿#696A﻿: Seen in a Vision by Wm Blake and Drawn while the Same remained Before him. My Self J. Varley being Present. in his Front room first floor No. 3 Fountain Court near Exeter Change. The authority of the inscriptions by John Linnell apparently derives from Varley, for Linnell was not present when the drawings were made. However, he seems to have copied Varley very carefully. For instance, his long inscription on the replica of Wat Tyler ﻿#738﻿ is exactly like that of Varley ﻿#737﻿. I have therefore included the Linnell inscriptions almost as if they were Blake’s.
 
Blake’s Hebrew
 
 
1. Detail of Blake’s letter to his brother, 30 Jan. 1803. Lessing J. Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress.
 
 
In his letter to his brother James of 30 January 1803, Blake wrote “am now learning my Hebrew אבג‎,”In A Concordance to the Writings of William Blake, ed. David V. Erdman et al. (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1967) 1: 903, this is given as “AM NOW LEARNING MY HEBREW (ALEPH BETH GIMMEL).” and he wrote Hebrew inscriptions on a dozen of his surviving pictures. However, he never learned the Hebrew script very well, and his formation of letters was sometimes “scrambled,” with the letters erratically formed, creating ambiguity in their interpretation.Abraham Samuel Shiff, “Blake’s Hebrew Calligraphy,” Blake 46.2 (fall 2012): 34 pars. The Hebrew on Blake’s “Laocoön” and Milton pl. 15 is not recorded in my essay because it is regularly given in editions of Blake’s writings. For other essays about Blake’s Hebrew, see Arnold Cheskin, “The Echoing Greenhorn: Blake as Hebraist,” Blake 12.3 (winter 1978-79): 178-83; Sheila A. Spector, “Blake as an Eighteenth-Century Hebraist,” Blake and His Bibles, ed. David V. Erdman (West Cornwall, CT: Locust Hill Press, 1990) 179-229; Spector, “Blake’s Graphic Use of Hebrew,” Blake 37.2 (fall 2003): 63-79; Spector, “Hebraic Etymologies of Proper Names in Blake’s Myth,” Philological Quarterly 67 (1988): 345-63 (“it seems likely that Blake used Parkhurst’s Hebrew and English Lexicon” [1762; 4th ed. 1799]); Menachem Wecker, “Did William Blake Know Hebrew?” Jewish Daily Forward 11 Dec. 2009 (“Blake had not even mastered the letter alef”).
 
Words in Blake’s Design Inscriptions Not in Blake ConcordancesMany of the arcane words newly recorded here, such as Balder, Cynthea, Hampton, Hoders, Mona, Rinda, and Sigtryg, derive from Blake’s quotations of the authors he is illustrating, such as Gray and Milton. The list omits words in Hebrew. 

These inscriptions add a significant number of words to Blake’s known vocabulary.Blake’s writings are recorded in Erdman, A Concordance (2 vols.), and his conversations in Bentley, William Blake’s Conversations: A Compilation, Concordance, and Rhetorical Analysis (Lewiston: Edwin Mellen Press, 2008). Neither records words in Hebrew.

Inscriptions on his apprentice drawings ﻿#1-47﻿ are probably not by Blake. Some (e.g., ﻿#6﻿) were certainly added after the drawings were made.
 
Manuscript annotations of “Engraved” or “Engraved reversed” on the drawings (e.g., ﻿#330 151, 153﻿) for Young’s Night Thoughts, because they do not seem to be by Blake.
 
Meaningless squiggles of writing on A Young Woman Reclining on a Couch, Writing in a Book (1780-85) ﻿#147﻿, on the tombstone in the watercolor for Young’s Night Thoughts, Night III, p. 21 (1795-96) ﻿#330 96﻿, in the palm-sized book held in the angel’s left hand in “And the Angel Which I Saw Lifted Up His Hand to Heaven” (1805) ﻿#518﻿, and elsewhere.
 
Engraved text on Blake’s commercial prints, which was presumably supplied by the publisher and sometimes transcribed by a professional writing engraver, as in “Moore and Cọ’s Manufactory and Warehouse” advertisement (1797-98).For the full inscription, including identification of “Common Carpet Loom,” “Persia and Turkey Carpet Loom,” and “Stocking Frame,” see Essick XII and fig. 23. The Longman accounts for “Blake’s Hesiod” record “Jeffreys Writing” (BR[2] 772-73) to Blake’s thirty-seven plates. Blake almost certainly inscribed the writing on the plates for George Cumberland’s Thoughts on Outline (1796), including both imprints and titles (some in Greek), but presumably he was merely following Cumberland’s directions or designs. Blake etched the whole text of Hayley’s Little Tom the Sailor (1800).
 
Inscriptions on designs in Blake’s Notebook (1785-1805), Vala or The Four Zoas (?﻿1796-?﻿1807), and Upcott’s autograph album (1826), as well as those printed in his works in illuminated printing, which are recorded in Bentley, William Blake’s Writings.

The Hat shou’d be dispos’d in a careless manner and as near to the Boy’s manner of wearing it as possible” “Recd of Mr. Cousins one half of a subscription, June 11, 1783”The attribution of the drawing to Blake and the inscription derive from the Sotheby’s catalogue of 1-2 July 1915, lot 371. If the author is Blake, “my sister” is Catherine Elizabeth Blake (1764–1841), who would have been nineteen in 1783, and the subscription could be to Stothard’s “Zephyrus and Flora” or “Calisto,” engraved by Blake and published by Parker and Blake, 17 Dec. 1784. The date suggests that the children are not those of “Mr. Cosens, owner of the Mill at Felpham,” mentioned in Blake’s “Memorandum” (1803) of his quarrel with Scolfield (BR[2] 162).

Young, Night Thoughts (1797), p. 63, illustrating “This KING OF TERRORS is the PRINCE OF PEACE”; some of the Hebrew characters are reversed, others are “scrambled” or a “graffiti-like emulation of Hebrew” (Abraham Samuel Shiff, “Blake’s Hebrew Calligraphy,” Blake 46.2 [fall 2012]: par. 3). On the corresponding drawing ﻿#330 108﻿ the lines on the scroll are meaningless. According to Shiff (par. 8), probably Blake was “not in command of the Hebrew alphabet in 1797.”

Job (1826) pl. 1
  
“1” “Our Father which art in Heaven hallowed be thy Name” [Matthew 6.9] “Thus did Job continually” [Job 1.5] “There was a Man in the Land of Uz whose Name was Job. and that Man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and eschewed Evil and there was born unto him Seven Sons and Three Daughters” [Job 1.1, 2] “The Letter Killeth | The Spirit giveth Life” [2 Corinthians 3.6]“It is Spiritually Discerned”1 Corinthians 2.14: “They are spiritually discerned.”

Spector, “Blake as an Eighteenth-Century Hebraist,” Blake and His Bibles, ed. David V. Erdman [West Cornwall, CT: Locust Hill Press, 1990] 202, Christopher Rowland, Blake and the Bible [New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010] 26-27, and Abraham Samuel Shiff, “Blake’s Hebrew Calligraphy,” Blake 46.2 [fall 2012]: pars. 23-33). “I shall see God”Job 19.26: “in my flesh shall I see God.” “Thou art our Father” [Isaiah 63.16] “We shall awake up in thy Likeness”Psalm 17.15: “I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.” “When the Almighty was yet with me, When my Children were about me” [Job 29.5] “There was a day when the Sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord” [Job 2.1]

Job (1826) pl. 5

Job (1826) pl. 6
  
“6” “Naked came I out of my mothers womb and Naked shall I return thither | The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away.

Some changes may be more significant but yet trifling, such as “heavens” for “heaven” (1.1) and “cleave to” for “cleave unto” (2.24), and these I have omitted. And of course Blake includes some rather unusual words, such as “bdellium” (2.12), just as they are in the King James translation.

“Did he who made the Lamb make the… Tyger”?
 
By Eliza Borkowska
 
Eliza Borkowska (eborkowska@swps.edu.pl) is assistant professor of English at the University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Warsaw. She is the author of But He Talked of the Temple of Man’s Body. Blake’s Revelation Un-Locked (2009), which studies Blake’s idiom against rationalist philosophy of language. She is currently working on her contribution to The Reception of William Blake in Europe, writing her second book (The Presence of the Absence: Wordsworth’s Discourses on God), and co-translating Blake’s Jerusalem into Polish.
 
 
 
None of the “duets” Blake included in his Songs of Innocence and of Experience contains more questions than the pair of lyrics that will be the focus of this essay, “The Lamb” and “The Tyger.” And none of these questions provokes more critical speculation than the experienced speaker’s “Did he who made the Lamb make thee?” It is just one of the unanswered queries of “The Tyger,” but it catches the eye and inflames the pen the most.For example, Damon pays attention to the question in his monumental William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols (277-78), and Paley, in his splendid survey of criticism of “The Tyger” (chapter 2, “Tyger of Wrath,” of his Energy and the Imagination), responds to Damon’s analysis (39) and then refers to the question again in his discussions of “the sublime of terror” and of Los’s furnaces. Chapter 16 (“The Tyger”) of Raine opens and closes with this question; Wagenknecht quotes it near the beginning of his chapter “The Lamb and The Tyger” (80) and then comes back to it repeatedly. Peterfreund, on the other hand, concludes his “Power Tropes” by considering “the status of [this] question.” Though other questions precede and follow it, critical intuition or simply sensitivity to sense and structure suggests that this is the climax of the poem’s (or indeed the poems’) questioning.
 
In fact, sensitivity to the structure of “The Tyger” should suggest one response to this question, which, though seemingly obvious, is seldom, if ever, given. Immediately after “Did he who made the Lamb make thee?” comes the famous repetition—the lines that constitute the beginning of the poem, that open “The Tyger.” By repeating the lines Blake actually identifies the question’s “thee” and indicates its addressee: it is not a tyger or, worse, a tiger,The “beasts of prey” that appear in chapter 2 of Paley (30-60) are thoroughly symbolic, but those that haunt chapter 16 of Raine (2: 3-31) are not, nor is Peterfreund’s “tiger,” which is reified as the speaker of experience “buys into Newtonian metonymic logic of natural theology” (134; see 134-38). Neither is the “tiger” that inspires Hernadi’s question “What are the social and political implications of Blake’s contrast between the domesticated lamb grazing on English pastures and the fierce tiger, chiefly roaming in untamed India?,” which he asks to illustrate the way that “new avenues of interpretation keep opening up” in our “post-colonial age” (69n11). but “Tyger Tyger burning bright, / In the forests of the night.” In other words, he emphasizes his experienced poem’s self-referential character and, in effect, suggests the answer (or at least an answer) to its climactic question. Did he who made “The Lamb” also make “Tyger Tyger burning bright”? Of course he did, because there is one and the same maker behind the two works—William Blake, who was perfectly aware of the provocation his work offered and who made it part of his artistic program aimed at “rouz[ing] the faculties to act.”Adapted from Blake’s letter to Dr. Trusler of 23 August 1799. Roused by Trusler’s objections concerning the obscurity of his work, Blake replied: “You say that I want somebody to Elucidate my Ideas. But you ought to know that What is Grand is necessarily obscure to Weak men. That which can be made Explicit to the Idiot is not worth my care. The wisest of the Ancients considerd what is not too Explicit as the fittest for Instruction because it rouzes the faculties to act” (E 702). Without doubt the self-referential element of “The Tyger” is Blake’s way to add more fuel to the fires of experience to let them burn all the brighter. However, this self-referential turn is not an independent act but a part of the program as a whole, and it cannot be effectively performed before an unprepared audience, on an unprepared stage. Let me therefore return to it later, at a more mature stage of this reflection, after I explain how I understand the idea of this performance.
 
Indeed, just like its self-referential turn, “The Tyger” as a whole cannot be treated as an independent act either. Its climactic question, by referring explicitly to “the Lamb,” suggests that “The Tyger” itself constitutes only part of this program. In other words, the poem of Experience should not be discussed in isolation from the poem of Innocence, which is likewise implied by the manner in which Blake published the two works.It is well known that the Songs of Innocence were published separately in 1789 and then, in 1794, incorporated into the combined volume of Songs of Innocence and of Experience. This is to say, “The Tyger” should not be discussed separately from “The Lamb,” a connection that is often ignored in critical practice; as Wagenknecht puts it, “most critics have used the cryptic simplicity of ‘The Lamb’ as a pretext for saying nothing about it” (80). They are programmed to form a whole, and only as parts of this whole, through the interaction into which they enter while combined, do they reveal their potential to provoke, stimulate, rouse. They throw light and shadow upon each other. They satirizeThe “double-edged irony” of the Songs was most memorably emphasized by Frye: “The Songs of Experience are satires, but one of the things that they satirize is the state of innocence. They show us the butcher’s knife which is waiting for the unconscious lamb. Conversely, the Songs of Innocence satirize the state of experience, as the contrast which they present to it makes its hypocrisies more obviously shameful” (237). and, simultaneously, illumine each other; they mock themselves and, at the same time, give an enthusiastic license to the attitudes they promote—when seen in this shade and this light. Such a shadowy reading of the illuminated pair has of course been attempted, yet none of the analyses gives a full account of the poems’ dynamic nature, their shifts of perspective, and the range of attitudes inscribed in them by their provocative author, he who made both “The Lamb” and “The Tyger,” the tyger and the lamb.
 
To return to the theatrical metaphor, which will to some extent organize the first stage of this discussion: the most vital element of the preparation of the audience is to redirect their attention. They come to the theatre with certain expectations: they are obviously familiar with the songs they are about to hear, and hence redirecting their attention consists largely in drawing it slightly away from ontological/​metaphysical exploration itself and focusing it more upon the form that this exploration takes. As I mentioned, none of the duets Blake included in his Songs asks more questions than these two lyrics. That is to say, Blake himself makes an effort to draw our attention to questions, possibly because of their ambiguity. A question may be asked when the answer is genuinely sought, which means that it is not known. While betraying the questioner’s ignorance, such a question simultaneously reveals his/her knowledge: s/he knows that s/he does not know the answer (and that is why s/he asks the question); s/he has enough knowledge to formulate the query. Then again, some questions, like those asked rhetorically, may imply that the questioner knows the answer very well (or, sometimes, that s/he knows very well that there is no answer). In brief, questions provoke questions concerning their status, and Blake seems to rely upon the ambiguity they entail for the effect he wants to achieve—for the stimulation, for rousing the audience’s faculties to act.
 
As for the preparation of the stage upon which the performance is given, three critical decisions will serve the purpose. The first is to remove everything that could disturb or distract; in the case of Blake’s Songs (or any performance based on Blake), this means in particular sweeping up very carefully the cobwebs of morality. The second element is to push backwards metaphysical inquiries, so that they do not form a curtain that obscures the performance but are hung at the rear of the stage, mainly as a backdrop. And the third critical decision is to place the speakers of the lyrics at the front of the stage and adjust the spotlights so that sometimes one of these speakers is more visible, sometimes the other, and at other times both stand in focus.

The beginning of the performance is simple. It starts with the spotlight focused solely on the speaker of innocence, with the speaker of “The Tyger” invisible; in other words, it begins with “The Lamb” as part of the separately published Songs of Innocence. Read in this way, the lyric presents itself, indisputably, as an exposition of innocence, which gets defined as the poem’s questions find their confident answers. The speaker is a child; his identity does not need to be inferred but is revealed as directly as could be wished (“I a child”); even his sex is indicated in the illustration provided by the author. The speaker’s identity is also reflected on the level of sounds: the poem’s easily pronounceable “Little Lamb who made thee”; its smooth “Gave thee clothing of delight”; its rhymes, which make the whole easy to remember, like a nursery rhyme. In this mood, the poem’s repetitions acquire a childlike tinge as well: the repeated questions and answers sound like the way children are taught or teach themselves about the world. The same is manifest in the poem’s vocabulary: its “meek and … mild” adjectives, which refer largely to qualities that depend upon the senses—the touch (“softest”), the sight (“bright”), the hearing (“tender voice”)—and its nouns, which stand for concrete objects—the “stream,” the “mead,” the “vales,” the “child,” and the “lamb” are all names for what falls within the experience of a child of nature. In this light, the “Lamb,” He who made the world, seems to be incorporated within this range of the speaker’s experience as well; He is “meek” like the lamb, “mild” like its “tender” voice, which is echoed by—and spreads onto—the valleys that He made to sustain its life. This is probably why the questions about creation (“who made thee”), the sustenance of life (“bid thee feed”), and its aesthetic side in the first stanza find such an unimpeded answer. These are essentially the same questions as those that will be asked by the speaker of “The Tyger,” but here they seem and sound easy because of the ease with which the answer is given. As I said above, seen on its own, “The Lamb” defines the abstraction it represents and makes it as concrete as itself. Innocence emerges from such a reading as possessed of the most fundamental knowledge and as an embodiment of the highest wisdom, because only wisdom is able to answer the most essential questions without hesitation or doubt.
 
But this outlook on innocence (and Innocence) is possible only as long as “The Lamb” remains locked within the confines of the state (and the collection) it represents, that is, only when it is seen on its own, without any tygers on the horizon. The moment the other speaker steps into the spotlight, which is to say, the moment the poem is read along with the counterpart its maker provided in Songs of Experience, hesitation and doubt appear concerning the nature and definition of innocence. Most explicitly, by asking his climactic question, the speaker of “The Tyger” makes it clear that he knows about tigers as well as lambs. This does not seem to apply to the speaker of innocence. As far as the creation goes, he knows only (about) the lamb, and the doubt that appears at this point concerns precisely what he would say if he found himself in a different valley; how would he answer if he knew more? He also knows about the Lamb. But, doubt prompts us to ask, how much does he know? Is he aware that the meek and mild nature of the Lamb, which he emphasizes, makes it a perfect sacrificial animal? In other words, is he aware of the implications of what he is saying? And another doubt follows: how is it that he actually knows about the Lamb? Would a child really come up with the argument that this child provides in his answer? Would a child generate such an entirely language-based equation (“I a child and thou a lamb, / We are called by his name”)?The illustration for “The Lamb,” particularly in its depiction of the child, is again remarkable in this context. Discussing him along with other details of the etching, Wagenknecht draws attention to “the slightly stiff unchildlike gesture of the infant” (81; emphasis mine). Is the child’s answer, which stresses the unity of the creator (the Lamb who became a little child) and the created (the lamb and the child himself), really intuitive? Is it indeed based on the child’s experience? (Let us remember, “The Lamb” is not a poem of Experience.) The answer stanza, which is based on linguistic association, sounds largely disconnected from the question stanza; it seems completely abstracted from the sensual details of delight, from the valley in which the questions are asked. So perhaps in the answer stanza, as in the other parts of this utterance, the child is simply repeating—this time not himself, but those who taught him the smooth equation, who teach by repeating and asking the child to repeat. In short, the foundations upon which the speaker of Innocence builds his certainty seem uncertain. No longer confined to the limits of Innocence, but seen in the light, or indeed the shadow, that Experience sheds upon it, the knowledge of the spokesman of innocence seems restricted; “The Lamb” no longer sounds like another romantic poem about the wisdom of children, about the child as “father of the man.” Completely unaware of the complications and implications, asking questions only in order to repeat the ready answers, questioning but not inquisitive enough, innocence, when viewed in the shade of experience, emerges as an exhibition of ignorance.
 
On the other hand, read in this dim light, or indeed in the shade of innocence’s ignorance, experience manifests itself as knowledge. As I pointed out above, its speaker knows about tigers as well as lambs, possibly all types of lambs—the bleating lambs, the bleeding lambs, the bleeding Lamb. And he knows much more—in fact, he asks so many questions because he knows so much. Unlike the speaker of innocence, the speaker of experience does not unveil his face; no matter how sharp the spotlight, it will never fully reveal his features,In fact, we cannot even be sure of the speaker’s sex. My reliance on gender-specific language, fully justifiable in the case of the speaker of innocence, is, in the case of the speaker of experience, motivated mainly by convenience. because in the state of experience nothing is given without effort on the part of the receiver, nothing is handed on a plate. The experienced voice only implies the identity of its source, and the ear that listens to this voice must work to infer whom it is listening to on the basis of what the speaker says and how it is said.

From the very beginning, this voice attacks the listener with the harshness of the sounds it utters, with the vigor of its rhythms and rhymes. Indeed, heard after the previous speaker’s performance, “The Tyger” sounds like an advanced exercise in the art (the word used in line 9) of rhyming. It is patterned through its six stanzas into flawless couplets,Including the seemingly irregular “eye”–​“symmetry,” which in the mouth of Blake’s speaker did rhyme (see Bentley 116-17), like “Fly”–​“enmity” or “Eye”–​“Eternity” in “Auguries of Innocence” (lines 33-34, 67-68, E 490-91) or “family”–​“die” in pl. 27 of Jerusalem (E 173). Similarly, see Wordsworth’s “high”–​“sanctity” and “sky”–​“mortality,” both from one stanza/paragraph of canto 7 (lines 1846-47 and 1852-53, H 416) of The White Doe of Rylstone, or the triplet “sky”–​“imagery”–​“eye” from “Elegiac Musings” (lines 19-21, H 583). whereas the speaker of “The Lamb” seemed unable to sustain the consistency of the rhyming scheme through two simple stanzas. Another striking thing is the extent to which the innocent speaker’s rhyming relied on repetition—at the beginning of each stanza (“thee”–“thee”), at the end (“thee”–“thee”), and in the middle of the second stanza (“name”–“Lamb”, “lamb”–“name”)—as if he ran out of rhymes because his word stock was too poor. By contrast, the speaker of experience has plenty to draw from. His words are by no means limited to what the eye can see or the hand can touch. The first stanza’s adjective “immortal” or its abstract noun “symmetry” make this point visible, indeed glaring, burning bright: the poem’s fluency is impressive when read against the concrete vocabulary of the first stanza of its innocent counterpart. Again, when the experienced speaker uses verbs, they are much more refined than the verbs of innocence (compare the second stanza’s “aspire” to “is”–“became” in the second stanza of “The Lamb”). He can go for the less obvious synonym (compare the first stanza’s “frame” with “made” in the first stanza of “The Lamb”). More than that, he can actually multiply synonyms: “sieze,” “grasp,” “clasp.” Also, when it comes to concrete nouns, the experienced speaker is not limited to the surface, to what covers the skin (the “clothing wooly bright”), but he knows what is hidden under it (“the sinews of [the] heart”). He does not rely upon what is general (compare the forms of “make,” which are used five times within the first stanza of “The Lamb”), but knows enough to be specific, to enumerate the concrete tools required in the process of making: “hammer,” “chain,” “furnace,” “anvil.”
 
All the more strikingly, the speaker of experience knows enough to talk in a way that refers the audience to what they know. While trying to envision the artisan/the maker whose art could twist those sinews and whose hand or shoulder, or eye, could/dared handle these tools in whatever “deeps or skies,” he speaks a language that evokes associations with, for example, the fires of Vulcan/Hephaestus as much as with Prometheus’s gift (or theft) of fire: “What the hand, dare sieze the fire?” The preceding question, “On what wings dare he aspire?,” placed immediately before an allusion to Prometheus, brings to mind yet another ancient myth and prompts us to ask, were the wings of him who made the tyger like those of Daedalus or like those of Icarus? In other words, did he control the course of his flight? While making the tyger, did the maker know what he was doing? Is the tyger an element of a plan? Or, perhaps, is it an accident resulting from the fact that the maker lost himself, got carried away?
 
The speaker of experience uses language that justifies even Raine’s references to (in order of appearance) Boehme, Paracelsus, Heraclitus, Berkeley, Mosheim, Lardner, Priestley, Cerinthus, Fludd, Agrippa, Hermes Trismegistus, the alchemists and the Gnostics, and their “ambiguous” demiurge (Raine 2: 3-31). His words validate these and many other references because they are handled in a way that seems to be a deliberate, conscious evocation. The speaker is intelligent, and he is a poet (we could even risk using Bloom’s phrase “the Bard of Experience”):Bloom 137;  emphasis mine. The phrase seems quite relevant in this context, though the construct itself that Bloom arrives at is best characterized by Paley as “entirely read into the poem” (Paley 40). he knows how to be maximally concise and maximally suggestive at the same time. Most importantly in our context, the speaker is knowledgeable; while thinking of the implications of what he says, the audience, Blake’s readers or critics, do not seem to be in danger of knowing more than he knows. The innocent speaker’s words (for example, “he calls himself a Lamb”) refer the audience to what the speaker seems not to know (for example, the sacrificial implications of the Lamb). The experienced speaker, on the other hand, by the way he picks words and by the images he selects, suggests that he knows the whole range of myths and religions that critics have brought up in a century and a half of critical interpretation of “The Tyger.”Following Paley (37), I regard Swinburne’s William Blake: A Critical Essay (1868)—“both a critical biography and a manifesto of radical poetics” (Kuduk 253)—as the starting point of the long history of critics’ endeavors to determine the poem’s implications. For a survey of criticism followed by a list of 113 books, book chapters, and articles, see Borowsky. His list could obviously be expanded by texts that appeared after it was created; for more recent contributions, see G. E. Bentley, Jr.’s “William Blake and His Circle,” published annually in Blake.
 
All these details considered, experience seems to communicate knowledge. And yet, although the spokesman of experience can generalize and look under the skin, though he is aware of implications and complications and, as Wagenknecht puts it, has “access … to technical insights” (91), he is unable to handle the essentials. Indeed, experience is unable to answer the fundamental question—who/what immortal hand or eye made thee?—that innocence answers without hesitation or doubt. In other words, experience is underlaid by the most elementary ignorance. It does not even know the most basic thing: how to make itself useful. Having asked “Did he who made the Lamb make thee?,” the speaker of experience reverts to the questions he asked at the beginning. All the energy put into the formulation of the intermediate questions has been wasted, the whole exertion—of the speaker’s brain and heart—futile.
 
Or, perhaps, even worse than futile, if we look at the detail that tends to attract a lot of critical attention,See, for example, Nurmi (680), Grant (75), Wagenknecht (85-86), and Peterfreund (137). the disparity between the first stanza’s more neutral “could” and the last stanza’s awe-inspiring “dare.” Employing his entire knowledge to envision the creature and the maker all the more precisely, the speaker progresses from seeing “fearful symmetry” (line 4) to perceiving “deadly terrors” (line 16); what in line 8 was “the hand” of the maker by line 12 has become a “dread hand” possessed of a “dread grasp” (line 15). No words of the speaker suggest that any change whatsoever has taken place in the maker or the tyger; it seems that they are as they were before all these intermediate questions have been asked. Thus, the change seems to have occurred not in what is being described but entirely in the mind of the subject who produces the description. Perhaps he did start by asking questions about the tyger and its maker, but he evidently ends up inquiring about the constructs of his own mind.In this context, it is good to remember Raine’s reminder that, in The Four Zoas, “the tigers … are created by Urizen” (2: 4). Somewhere along the way the act of describing got detached from the object of the description. This is clearly visible in the tiger Blake drew under the poem, which is not “ferocious”The word has been borrowed from Ferber; commenting on the reproduction of “The Tyger” in Phillips (William Blake: The Creation of the Songs: From Manuscript to Illuminated Printing [2000]), he writes parenthetically: “The ‘Tyger’ is the same as the one from Copy T in the Blake Trust/Princeton edition; it is, alas, no more ferocious than in other copies …” (492). enough; to borrow Pagliaro’s memorable phrase, it looks like “a cat with a human face” (87) and is completely incompatible with the last line’s awesome “dare.” Let me repeat that such an application, indeed misapplication, of energy and exertion is not just futile. It is an intellectual error resulting from the speaker’s most elementary ignorance: he simply does not know what he is talking about. In brief, experience, which seemed to imply knowledge, compromises itself. It knows only how to ask questions, but does not know how to answer them, because its questions, fed by its “knowledge,” take it further and further away from the object of reflection.
 
Viewed—or indeed reviewed—from this shadowy perspective where experience betrays its ignorance, innocence reestablishes itself as wisdom. It can ask and answer without exertion, with ease. It resolves the tension of a question by a prompt answer in a way that is as natural as exhaling after inhaling. Children of innocence answer with the simple “Yea, yea; Nay, nay” (Matthew 5.37), which is also how grown-ups of experience should answer (after all, the Lamb’s sermon on the mount was addressed to adults, to those who know of tygers, who have heard them roar). A little later in his gospel, Matthew records how Jesus “called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of [his disciples], And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye … become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven” (Matthew 18.2-3). Again, to assume the attitude of a child is certainly not a task for children: it is adults of experience who must train themselves in the wisdom of innocence—trust, rely on the word/Word rather than demonstration (“blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed”),Jesus’s words to doubting Thomas (John 20.29). learn what they have been taught, repeat and have faith in what they have been told. However much the tygers along the way have managed to roar the “tender voice” down, adults of experience must teach themselves again how to breathe, how to answer fundamental questions (“who made thee”) without hesitation or doubt.
 
Paley is right to insist that Blake’s innocence is not an “illusion” (31). It never loses its validity. It has the power to reassert itself, no matter how many ironies experience heaps upon it. A good example is the innocent trust in “Mercy Pity Peace and Love” (“The Divine Image”). Experience, making a pretense of being a perceptive response to innocence’s naiveties, can ridicule it: “Mercy no more could be, / If all were as happy as we” (“The Human Abstract”). But the viewpoint offered by Blake’s mythology supports the innocent, not the experienced, attitude. Mercy, being the forgiveness of sins, is confirmed as the first attribute of God (“the Divine Mercy / … Redeems Man in the Body of Jesus Amen,” Jerusalem 32[36].54-55, E 179); love, mercy, pity, and peace emerge from Jerusalem as the genuine features of the Divine Image.See the subchapter “Love-Mercy-Pity-Peace: Man as a Temple of God” (219-21) in my But He Talked of the Temple of Man’s Body. In other words, while trying to compromise innocence, experience compromises itself. It operates through deceit. It defaces the Divine Image and perverts the divine sense of “Mercy Pity Peace and Love” by artfully replacing the keywords of innocence, the virtues of delight, with their homonyms, the social corruptions (generated by experience itself) of the divine attributes: “mercy” that subsists on someone’s misery, “pity” that lives on someone’s poverty, etc. While heaping ironies on innocence, experience heaps ironies on itself. It seems to communicate discernment and maturity, but in reality its perceptiveness is fake, its ripeness rotten.
 
“The Lamb” and “The Tyger,” as part of the same collection of poems and of the same poetic program to “rouze the faculties to act,” operate in much the same way as “The Divine Image” and “The Human Abstract.” But here the “complex awareness which Blake’s double perspective creates” (Paley 31) is even more complex than in the case of that pair, or “The Chimney Sweeper,” “Holy Thursday,” or “I heard an Angel singing,”“A Notebook poem contemporary with Songs of Experience” (Paley 52n1) that sounds like a combination of “The Divine Image” and “The Human Abstract”; see E 470-71. all of which Paley considers in Energy and the Imagination (32, 51-52). The wisdom of “The Lamb,” perceived as ignorance in the light of the “learning” of “The Tyger,” establishes itself again as wisdom in the shade of the futility and elementary ignorance that “The Tyger” uncovers and satirizes. However, the rigor of this particular performance requires that the audience recognize that experience is not an illusion either. The fearful symmetry of this pair demands that experience also has the means and the power to reassert itself.
 
Partly it reasserts itself without the help of innocence. This is particularly visible in the poem’s repetitions. As I noted above, they are completely unlike the repetitions in “The Lamb,” which sound like the way children are taught or teach themselves. The experienced speaker’s repetitions have nothing to do with learning or teaching; they are rather an exposition of the futility of acquiring knowledge. The disparity between the first stanza’s “could” and the last stanza’s “dare,” on the other hand, shows that the knowledge acquired in experience leads to an intellectual error, because the person relying upon such knowledge goes further and further away from what he would desire to know (“Did he who made the Lamb make the… Tyger”?). And yet, groping in the forests of the night, the speaker of experience seems aware of the fact that he actually trips over the obstacles he has put in his own way. Peterfreund claims that the speaker makes the error of “reason[ing] back from the tiger as created effect to an understanding of his creative first cause” (127). But the point is that the speaker of experience is wise enough to know it. Rationalists, natural scientists/​theologians—Newton himself (whose version of metonymic logic presented in Principia is the focal point of Peterfreund’s essay), Robert Boyle and William Paley (whom Peterfreund quotes on p. 129), as well as Bacon and Locke (who, along with Newton, form the false trinity that Blake criticized for worshipping Urizen)—all made the error that Peterfreund identifies. They attributed “‘the causes of natural things’ to a divine first and final cause” (Peterfreund 128-29) and tried to understand the “creative [transcendent] first cause” by studying the “created effects.” As a result, they ended up worshipping the image of the creator that was the effect of their reasoning: God as a “Work-master,” “the all-wise Architect,” “the infinite wise Contriver of us and all things about us.”The first term comes from Bacon’s Advancement of Learning (2.14.9); the other two are from Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding (2.23.12). But the speaker of experience seems more conscious of his own predicament than Peterfreund is ready to acknowledge. He does not need to be informed or reminded that there is an intellectual error in his reasoning, that his acts are “deluded” (Peterfreund 135), that his questions are “metonymic” and their logic “circular” (127), that questions asked in this way will not lead to any valid answers. The object he is trying to grasp/clasp is evading him, and he shows he knows it by concluding with doubt rather than with certainty, by repeating the initial question rather than attempting to answer it. In short, the “Bard of Experience” is not “in mental darkness” (Bloom 137) at all. By the way he picks words, by the images he selects and, as it turns out, by the rhetorical devices he relies upon, the experienced speaker suggests that he knows as much as the critics who comment upon his words.
 
But experience reasserts itself also when viewed against innocence, not, interestingly, because there is another shadow that makes innocence dark, but because the light of innocence seems dim when compared with the fires of experience. Innocence is like the lamb’s clothing, “wooly bright”; experience is like the tyger, “burning bright.” The brightness of innocence pertains to the surface (the clothing) and depends on the brightness around: the lamb’s clothing will not look “wooly bright” in the night. The fires of experience, which do not emanate from our sun but come from “distant deeps or skies,” are part of the internal makeup of the tyger. They break through its eyes and skin (the golden stripes on its fur look like flames of fire) and, “burning bright, / In the forests of the night,” are able to illumine the darkness around.
 
To make use of these metaphors and see how the wisdom of experience reasserts itself against the wisdom of innocence, it is crucial to look at the climactic stanza of “The Tyger,” which contains the question that this discussion has revolved around. In particular, it is time to consider the two lines that open the stanza, “When the stars threw down their spears / And water’d heaven with their tears.” These lines give trouble to those whose acquaintance with Blake is limited to the Songs, and they give scholars an opportunity to refer to Blake’s later writings, specifically “Night the Fifth” of The Four Zoas, where the stars’ throwing down their spears is associated with the fall of Urizen.To quote Urizen, “I calld the stars around my feet in the night of councils dark / The stars threw down their spears and fled naked away / We fell” (p. 64, E 344). Since Erdman’s Blake: Prophet against Empire (194), these lines have regularly been cited in criticism of “The Tyger”: see, for example, Nurmi (672-74), Gleckner (283), Adams (“Reading Blake’s Lyrics” 58), Raine (2: 29), Wagenknecht (94), and Paley (54). If we apply the light of Blake’s prophecy to his lyric, it transpires that the climax of the experienced speaker’s confrontation with the tyger and his attempt at a confrontation with its maker is the disarming of the rational power. The stars dissolve in powerless tears. Reason gives up, as it can no longer explain, systematize, rationalize, methodize. The questioner comes to a standstill; his reasoning process collapses in his repetition (and the awesome variation within his repetition: “dare” instead of “could”). And it is exactly in this repetition that the highest wisdom of experience is contained. Indeed, seen against the uncontrollable fires of experience, which come from “distant deeps or skies” and are a gift from without, the brightness of innocence appears to depend too much upon our sun. In fact, seen against the uncertainties of “The Tyger,” the certainties of “The Lamb” seem to derive too much from the rational power itself: this manifests itself through the poem’s puns, through the second stanza’s equation, which constructs the image of God on the basis of the study of language, and through the mathematical proportion of the answer it provides (He a Lamb, He a child, “I a child and thou a lamb”). The fearful symmetry of the tyger (and “The Tyger”) will not be resolved by such formulas. The repetition of the poem’s last stanza contains the ultimate wisdom of experience: that dumb amazement, the wonder expressed in a question mark, may be as near an experience of the divine as the finality of the full stop.
 
In short, Blake’s experience asserts itself again as wisdom, exactly like innocence. The crucial thing is to see that Blake does not oppose a “better” wisdom against a “worse” wisdom; he simply juxtaposes the wisdom of knowing the answer against the wisdom of allowing oneself not to know. “The Lamb” and “The Tyger” form a symmetry that is indeed fearful: no imbalance in this pair will justify simple solutions, in particular a recourse to the distorting categories of “good” and “evil.” In principle, critics remember that such categories are not to be employed in Blake criticism, though some of them forget the principle when it comes to analyzing Blake’s provocative Songs.Raine, for example, opens chapter 16 of Blake and Tradition with the claim that “the question of good and evil” is “the inspiration of ‘The Tyger’” (2: 3), and she relies on categories of good and evil throughout her discussion: “If we may call [the creator of the tyger] good, must we also call him evil?” (2: 3); “Much evidence might also be brought to prove that the Tyger is indeed an emblem of evil” (2: 4), etc. But of course the most notable and telling document in this respect is Paley’s long note (39-40n2), which is introduced with a sentence that reads “Since the time of these pioneer critics, writers on the poem have continued to disagree about whether the Tyger is ‘good’, created by the Lamb’s creator; ambiguous, its creator unknown and the question of the poem unanswerable; or ‘evil’, created by some maleficent force.” The note classifies commentators on Blake’s lyric according to the position they took in this good-ambiguous-evil debate. But this troubling collection, as much as The Marriage of Heaven and Hell or Blake’s later prophecies, is part of his poetic program, which was meant to rouse the faculties to act and not to put them to sleep by feeding them on compromised morality. And this is exactly what the Songs, including “The Lamb” and “The Tyger,” do: they activate, stimulate, and provoke, very much unlike the work of Blake’s rationalist predecessors, who mainly wanted to instruct. They are a dialogical work, a dramatic performance. Indeed, they are songs, which means that they are meant to be sung, thereby turning a listener into a performer who takes attitudes, abandons them, then embraces them again, depending on whether the stage upon which the singing is done is lit by the rays of innocence or the fires of experience. The lyrics throw both light and shadow upon each other, satirize each other, and mock themselves. They give the lie to the fictions their counterparts seem to propagate. At the same time, they give an enthusiastic license to the attitudes they promote and, by doing so, illustrate the ultimate truth about contraries: that they are “necessary to Human existence.”The dictum from The Marriage of Heaven and Hell pl. 3, quite understandably regularly quoted in criticism of the Songs. It is vital to know the answer to the question “who made thee,” to learn the definition provided by the biblical revelation (He a child, He a Lamb) and be able—when someone asks, or when something asks within us—to produce it on demand. And it is equally vital to know that to define Him best is to tremble with awe and astonishment, to be amazed, “terrified with admiration.”Seen against the light of the wisdom of innocence, the attitude of the experienced speaker is most accurately captured by this powerful phrase from Jerusalem (12.22, E 155); the speaker is not “hypnotized by fear and awe” (Wagenknecht 86), but, precisely, “terrified with admiration.” Probably the most expressive response to “the sublime of terror” in criticism of “The Tyger” is Paley’s “Tyger of Wrath” chapter in Energy and the Imagination (30-60).
 
I am returning here to the metaphors I used at the very beginning of this discussion, and I can likewise return to the idea with which these reflections opened, the self-referentiality of “The Tyger,” which can be viewed as yet another way in which the wisdom of experience, its self-awareness, manifests itself in the concluding stanzas of the poem. To rehearse the major point, immediately after the climactic question comes the repetition; “Did he who made the Lamb make thee?” asks the speaker, who then starts reciting “The Tyger” as if he wanted to specify what “Tyger,” what “Lamb,” and what maker he is in fact asking about. Given the long history of criticism of “The Tyger,” this claim about the poem’s self-referential character may sound like a provocation. But the provocation is not in the claim; it is in the material that inspires it. It will be helpful to remember that the poem was written around the time of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, whose provocation is readily apparent and derives, partly at least, precisely from its self-referential character: “the notion that man has a body distinct from his soul, is to be expunged; this I shall do, by printing in the infernal method, by corrosives, which in Hell are salutary and medicinal, melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid” (Marriage 14, E 39). Another detail to consider is that no matter how “the Lamb” in the climactic question of “The Tyger” is understood (as the lamb, or “The Lamb”—Blake’s erratic spelling and punctuation open up such doubts), the question does contain an allusion to the poem of Innocence. And it comes at the end of a largely self-referential stanza that leaves the reader in the dark unless s/he considers its symbols in the light of Blake’s later prophecies, particularly The Four Zoas.For an extensive discussion of the relationship between “The Tyger” and The Four Zoas, see in particular chapter 15 of Gleckner (275-87).
 
The speaker of experience wonders at the “hand or eye” that dared reach out, “sieze the fire,” and make the fire burn in the tyger’s eyes, so that the tyger (and “The Tyger”) are “burning bright, / In the forests of the night.” He wonders at the shoulder that could handle the chain and the hammer, at the labor performed at the anvil and in the furnace. These accessories of a blacksmith appear in the final version of the stanza that precedes the climactic one,To quote Erdman, “After line 12 several starts were made on a 4th stanza, first: ‘Could fetch it from the furnace deep / And in [thy] ﻿the﻿ horrid ribs dare steep’ then: ‘In the well of sanguine woe’ then: ‘In what clay and in what mould / Were thy eyes of fury rolld’” (E 794). Ackroyd’s reconstruction of Blake’s thought process in composing this stanza (144) has provoked criticism for his “tone of authoritative certainty about something as elusive as the creative process” (Benton 86), much as Nurmi’s earlier attempt to reconstruct the probable movements of Blake’s mind on the basis of the study of the manuscript revisions (“Blake’s Revisions of ‘The Tyger’”) was criticized by Grant as “unaccountably erroneous” (64). Nevertheless, if we are to draw conclusions concerning the creative process on the basis of the created effect, it seems legitimate to insist that it is only when Blake came up with the entire range of allusions to a blacksmith’s workshop that he accepted stanza 4 as part of his work in progress. As Erdman adds, in the course of the lyric’s composition this stanza was further “experimented with,” but, it appears, the “experiment” did not involve these allusions (see E 794-95). and they, like the “stars” and their forsaken “spears,” are also allusive. Of course they bring to mind the workshop of Los,The association between the allusions to a blacksmith’s tools and the workshop of Los is emphasized by practically every critic who views “The Tyger” in the light of Blake’s later prophetic books; see, for example, Gleckner (284-85), Miner (67-68), Raine (2: 18, 23), Paley (57-59), and Wagenknecht (91-92). who, according to Damon, “is Poetry, the expression in this world of the Creative Imagination” (A Blake Dictionary 246) and who, as “the expression of the Imagination, is the creator of all that we see” (247): a poet translating perception or experience into poetry. As Damon reminds us, in Milton (22[24].12, E 117) “Los … descends and becomes one with Blake” (A Blake Dictionary 251). In Jerusalem, on the other hand, Los may be taken as Blake himself, the poet developing his own philosophy and warring against the spiritual evils that afflict his nation. His great task is “To open the Eternal Worlds, to open the immortal Eyes of Man inwards into the Worlds of Thought, into Eternity ever expanding in the Bosom of God, the Human Imagination” (5:18).(A Blake Dictionary 251)
 
In summary, the questions of “The Tyger” are arranged in such a way that, beginning with the break after the third stanza (where the axis of this poem’s symmetry lies), they start drawing attention more and more forcefully to Blake’s other work,Wagenknecht says that “there is hardly the tiniest echo of the poem in the larger prophetic poems which has not been recorded, amplified, and meditated” (80); quite significantly, he makes this comment after quoting the poem’s climactic fifth stanza. Quoting the stanza again on p. 92, he comments upon its references to other poems in the Songs, as well as The French Revolution, Milton, The Four Zoas, The Book of Urizen, and Europe (92-99). to his labor as a poet, to him as a maker, and to this particular poem as a product of his art, the work of his “hand” and “eye.” In other words, on one level, the poem is an expression of awe and amazement at the maker who fashioned it in his furnace,Blake’s symbol of the imagination; see Paley (58-59), who supports the meaning of the furnace as the imagination with images from the Bible, Paracelsus, and Boehme. whose hammer beat its rhythm, whose chain could frame a tiger within the fearful symmetry of “The Tyger”: “Did he who made the Lamb make thee? / Tyger Tyger burning bright ….” If Wordsworth, for example, asked a similar question implying surprise at his own achievement and amazed admiration for his own work, it would sound egocentric, indeed narcissistic (though of course he would not ask such a question; there are hardly any memorable tigers in his work, as he mainly wrote of lambs).Perfectly natural ones, let us add, as in “The Last of the Flock” (H 114-16) or his sonnet “Composed on a May Morning, 1838,” which begins “Life with yon Lambs, like day, is just begun” (H 278). His best tigers function merely as metaphors, though they may be strikingly powerful, as in The Prelude, where revolutionary Paris is “a place of fear / Unfit for the repose of night, / Defenceless as a wood where tigers roam” (The Prelude [1805] 10.80-82). Intriguingly, according to Bateson (133), this passage was written a year or two after Wordsworth copied Blake’s “The Tyger” into his commonplace-book (see also Paley 36). Jonathan Wordsworth claims, however, that “Blake poems, including ‘The Divine Image’ and ‘The Tyger,’ [were] copied by Wordsworth into his commonplace-book” in spring 1807, and that the first part of book 10 of The Prelude, including the passage in question, was written before summer 1804 (see The Prelude. The Four Texts xvi, xvii). But when Blake/Blake’s lyrical “I” asks the question, it expresses the most fundamental guideline of his philosophy, his most sacred conviction about (the nature of) art.
 
Commenting specifically on a statement by Wordsworth in the preface to the Poems of 1815—“The powers requisite for the production of poetry are, first, those of observation and description …” (Poems by William Wordsworth 1: viii)—Blake writes: “One Power alone makes a Poet.—Imagination The Divine Vision” (E 665).For an extensive discussion of Blake’s annotations to Wordsworth, see chapter 9 (160-76) of Adams, Blake’s Margins. As he says in Milton (3.3-4, E 96) and then reiterates in Jerusalem,See Jerusalem 5.58-59 (E 148), 24.23 (E 169), 60.57 (E 211), and 74.13 (E 229). imagination is “the Divine Body of the Lord Jesus.” And the same persuasion is expressed and expanded in The Laocoön: “The Eternal Body of Man is The IMAGINATION. / that is God himself / The Divine Body / JESUS” (E 273). Jerusalem’s formulation of Los’s “great task,” quoted above, also contains the same conviction: “the Human Imagination” is “in the Bosom of God” (5.20). The rhymed verse in the preface “To the Public,” which comes shortly before this formulation of Los’s (and Blake’s) poetic program, addresses the reader as “[lover] of books! [lover] of heaven, / And of that God from whom [all books are given]” (E 145); under it, Blake writes: “When this Verse was first dictated to me ….” Books—as much as individual poems—are not written, they are dictated, because “We who dwell on Earth can do nothing of ourselves, every thing is conducted by Spirits” (E 145). Every creative impulse comes from “distant deeps or skies.” And if the “deeps” are indeed “hell,” as Raine seems to believe (2: 19), it is important to remember that in The Marriage (which, Raine stresses repeatedly, was “written about the same time” as “The Tyger”),Raine is particularly emphatic on this point. The full opening sentence of her chapter 16, quoted in part in note 19 above, reads: “The question of good and evil, which forms the theme of The Marriage, was likewise the inspiration of ‘The Tyger’, written about the same time” (2: 3), and she repeats the information that “The Tyger” and The Marriage were “written about the same time” on p. 31. the printing in the infernal method, by corrosives, is likewise carried out in “Hell.”
 
For all these reasons, “The Tyger,” Blake’s supreme act as a lyricist, which, on one level, is a tribute to what imagination can perform “when the stars thr[o]w down their spears,”As Paley notes (supporting his argument with quotations from Boehme and Paracelsus), “the defeat of the stars,” apart from the disarmament of reason, “signifies the casting off of both cosmic and internal constraint, freeing man to realize his potentially divine nature” (55;  emphasis mine); then, however, Paley reduces the meaning of this image to revolutionary and social implications (56). is not narcissistic. It is an expression of man’s surprise, awe, and amazement at something that does not in fact come from or pertain to man, that cannot be seen as man’s achievement, because it was given: it is a gift.To quote Damon again, imagination “is the gift of the Holy Ghost” (A Blake Dictionary 195). The poem captures a human being as he trembles, feeling a stirring of the Spirit that works through him. As suggested above, the poem’s self-referential character may be seen as yet another element of the provocation melted into the tissue of “The Tyger.” But on deeper reflection, or, more precisely, on reflection illumined by Blake’s later writings, this self-reflective character of experience only sounds like a provocation but is in fact an expression of the highest wisdom concerning the imagination and the fundamental unity of the human and the divine. To refer to the Blake Dictionary for the last time, imagination, “the basis of all art,” was in Blake’s opinion “the central faculty of both God and Man”; as Damon sums it up, “indeed, here the two [God and Man] become indistinguishable” (195; emphasis mine). In fact, “The Lamb” expresses the same wisdom. But it only talks about the unity of the human and the divine: He a child, I a child. “The Tyger,” on the other hand, does not assert but executes this unity.Much like the “Introduction” to Experience, which, according to Raine, accomplishes a similar identification through its “ambiguous syntax” and “erratic punctuation” (2: 27-28): “The voice of the Bard is the voice of imagination; the voice of imagination is the voice of the Holy Word ….” The poem shows how this unity works. Most essentially, it demonstrates that it works. And it forces Blake’s audiences, his readers and his critics, “lover[s] of books! lover[s] of heaven,” to accept the power of this demonstration and engage actively in the same execution (which, by the way, suggests that he could not but “smile [such] work to see”). The author who made “The Tyger” and “The Lamb” asks “Did he who made the Lamb make thee? / Tyger Tyger burning bright …,” and his readers and critics, trying to answer this question, regularly think, speculate, and write about God.

Sibylle Erle (sibylle.erle@bishopg.ac.uk), FRSA, is senior lecturer in English at Bishop Grosseteste University Lincoln, author of Blake, Lavater and Physiognomy (Legenda, 2010), co-editor of Science, Technology and the Senses (special issue for RaVoN, 2008), and volume editor of Panoramas, 1787-1900: Texts and Contexts (5 vols., Pickering and Chatto, 2012). With Morton D. Paley she is now co-editing The Reception of William Blake in Europe (Bloomsbury). She has co-curated the display Blake and Physiognomy (2010-11) at Tate Britain and devised an online exhibition of Tennyson’s copy of Blake’s Job for the Tennyson Research Centre (2013). Apart from reception, she is working on “character” in the romantic period.
 
 
 
Matthews’s book, a must-read for anyone interested in Blake and gender, reinvestigates Blake’s attitude toward sexual freedom, especially female desire, while firmly identifying his approach to gendered sexuality as a response to the dictates of eighteenth-century bourgeois culture, politeness, and sensibility. Matthews relocates Blake by focusing on his commercial works and recontextualizes his poetic language via the public discourse on sexuality within the bourgeois world. The new Blake emerges once the works normally associated with misogynistic views are more and better contextualized within the personal and textual networks surrounding them: “Like Oothoon, [Nicholas Rowe’s Jane] Shore is opened by suffering to a consciousness of others, losing a sense of her own separate self and of the separateness of sexuality from other categories” (198). Here, the feminine self is presented as emotionally involved and engaging (sexually), which means that it inadvertently challenges its liminal position as passive other, fixed as a norm and constructed through eighteenth-century cultural discourse. Female figures who are engaged, Matthews argues, counterpoint the masculine self and Adam Smith’s model of the sympathetic spectator, which relies on the point of view of the masculine self as focalizer of emotion.
 
Blake, Sexuality and Bourgeois Politeness discusses Blake alongside William Cowper, George Cumberland, Henry Fuseli, William Hayley, Samuel Richardson, Hannah More, and Mary Wollstonecraft. And it does a lot more than introduce yet another Blake; it addresses and tackles a fundamental paradox: how can the Blake of the 1790s, hailed as a figurehead for sexual liberation, be so negative about female desire in his later epic works? Much of the early writing on Blake’s sexual politics (Fox, Mellor, Ostriker), Matthews points out, helped to create the now-familiar account of an ideal Blakean world that excluded the physical body (which Blake didn’t like or was at least ambivalent about), a world represented as positive because those populating it were happy anyway. More often than not, Blake’s more mature and complicated myth, unfolding in Milton and Jerusalem, has been interpreted as steering toward a requirement that individual identity be transcended, neutralized in an androgynous-looking body. Surely this is not what Blake had in mind. The paradox, according to Matthews, can only be solved by dismantling the categories Blake is using, because what is now standard terminology among feminists clouds how unstable or slippery the language at Blake’s disposal actually was: “The difference of Beulah and Eternity is perhaps better understood in terms of differing understandings of the word ‘sexuality’ or of differing sexual cultures. It is clearly inappropriate to assume that there is a single entity called ‘sex’ or ‘sexuality’” (106), since the two-sex model, as discussed in the work of Thomas Laqueur, was not yet fully developed. In Blake’s time, “sexuality” designated what we now understand to be captured by “gender,” or rather the words “sex,” “sexual,” and “sexuality” define and convert “female” into “feminine.” Matthews takes her lead from queer scholarship (Bruder, Elfenbein, Hobson), which first identified and claimed positive treatments of same-sex desire, in order to reclaim “sexuality for feminism” (5). In Blake, Sexuality and Bourgeois Politeness she assembles and reconstructs literary and cultural contexts out of which the historically situated meaning of the word “sexuality” can be seen to emerge. With this approach, Matthews adds but also rejects some of the scholarly work (Makdisi, Mee, Thompson, Worrall) that has associated Blake’s opinions with radical and dissenting subcultures. She proposes that Blake was always pro-sex, and that only the complexity of his thoughts, communicated through texts and images, increased: “The key to my argument lies in the newness of the word ‘sexuality’ in Blake’s time” (3). Matthews works on shifts in meaning taking place within the bourgeois world, arguing that Blake commented critically on the increasing construction of gendered identity and the way it regulated sexual pleasure.
 
The book is organized into eight chapters, which trace the changes in the language as they become manifest in literature and visual culture and historicize the discourse of identity. Matthews is not interested in biographical connections, though she firmly roots her study in the Felpham years and both the time and language shared with Hayley, and perhaps overemphasizes the impact Fuseli may have had on Blake. The chapters, which intertwine late with early Blake and weave together works by several of his contemporaries, contain an impressive amount of archival research.
 
Chapter 1 starts with the expression “happy copulation” from Visions of the Daughters of Albion, and explains it as a visual and physically transformative or sexual experience, while pitching it against Smith’s sympathetic spectator, who remains emotionally detached and never enjoys or merges with what “he” observes. The backdrops for this discussion are the publication of Hogarth’s satiric prints in the 1790s and Barry’s anti-European attitudes. This point about visual culture is taken up in chapter 2, where Fuseli and public and private exhibition cultures existing independently of the Royal Academy move center stage. Matthews illuminates the symbolism in Fuseli’s Titania and Bottom and elaborates on his views of female sexuality as well as their European origins. All this resonates with Blake’s Gothic treatment of the perceived loss of sexual liberty and the sexual politics of Europe, where by means of the dream device and a frame narrative Blake associates sex with fairy power and healthy, unregulated passion.
 
The next chapter pair begins with the cultural denotations of the word “soft” and the editions of and illustrations to Hayley’s The Triumphs of Temper; it examines how words migrate from the “positive feminine sphere” (56) of Hayley’s poem, as well as his “feminised world” (73), into Blake’s poetry (An Island in the Moon), where they appear manipulated to counteract the objections made by Cowper, More, and Wollstonecraft. Matthews then turns to Hayley’s Essay on Old Maids and its “precursor texts” (84) in Hayley’s library, the main one being Martin Madan’s Thelyphthora. The discussion is on the benefits of desire on (old and young) bodies as well as society as a whole. Chapter 4, in other words, historicizes virginity and prostitution, as well as polygamy, to identify Blake’s pro-sex attitude, implied in the sympathetic characters Thel and Ololon.
 
In chapter 5, where Matthews delineates Blake’s revisionary reading of Cowper (a cousin of Madan), we see Blake move away from Hayley, since he undermines the feminized identity constructed in Hayley’s biography of Cowper by sexualizing it. Thematic and pictorial connections are made between The Task, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, the Urizen books, Milton, and illustrations to Cowper’s poems. Many of the passages that we have become accustomed to reading as descriptions of rape do not represent rape: “Sex is not the end of the story, as it is for Hayley and for Richardson …, but the event which precipitates or allows the possibility of change” (150). So far, we have learnt that sex (consensual or non-consensual) is good because it unblocks the body and releases its energies. Matthews now overlays earthquake imagery, which can symbolize a sexually excited female, with ideas of sexual liberation and artistic production. This allegorizing of violent acts is provocative rhetorically because it doesn’t face the fact that people have died from them. Chapter 6, however, historicizes rape narratives by investigating textual relations between Richardson’s Clarissa and Blake’s Visions and Cumberland’s annotations to Europe (copy D), because it examines connections between these texts via Edward Bysshe’s Art of English Poetry and the owners of this book: Richardson, Blake, and Cumberland. It looks into literary references and the use of quotations (in Clarissa) while comparing Blake’s annotations (to the books he owned) and Cumberland’s (to Europe) and exploring their impact on text. Matthews teases out the polysemy of the newly opened-up gaps. The conclusion is that Blake opted for an open and fragmented writing technique, a device that Matthews (too narrowly) associates with Alexander Geddes and German higher criticism. The effect is that Visions, because it doesn’t offer a coherent plot or the consciousness of a three-dimensional female character, exposes how the threat of rape is used to regulate female sexuality. To put this differently, with the multiple and competing voices suggesting female agency, Blake is mimicking the debate about female sexuality taking place at the end of the eighteenth century, as well as giving women a voice.
 
Chapter 7 engages with Blake’s illustrations to Blair’s The Grave and Malkin’s A Father’s Memoirs of His Child, which includes material from Mrs. Malkin’s journal, to explore expressions of mourning in the public sphere. It also treats the Petworth Vision of the Last Judgment (1808), a commission organized by Ozias Humphry and from Lord Egremont but for the Countess of Egremont, as well as Blake’s description of the painting, which, Matthews argues, was directed at female readers. This form of address makes the painting, like The Whore of Babylon (1809), an unambiguous and positive statement about liberated female sexuality (185). Blake not only embodies souls in his pictures of the afterlife but also infuses the bodies with sexual undertones, which upset the reviewers because it suggested to them visionary enthusiasm as well as excessive grieving. Blake’s art, according to Matthews, creates a spiritual world that is sexualized to include representations of equality as well as female empowerment. This world, which Matthews links to Fuseli’s, has room for parody and differs substantially from the world envisaged in (the more private) Jerusalem (184). The final chapter, which brings together writers and texts that Blake engaged with, finds that Blake was a consistent defender of female sexuality and rejected the regulative discourses of politeness, sensibility, enthusiasm, and evangelicalism. He was aware of the scandal caused by Godwin’s Memoirs and sympathetic toward Wollstonecraft: “Blake’s unqualified praise of Cumberland’s 1798 Captive, the year of the Wollstonecraft scandal and Malthus’s Essay, makes the argument that around this time he develops a virulent hostility towards active female sexuality particularly improbable” (190). Positioning Blake’s utopian ideas of sexual union, which transcend the individual identity of a visually gendered body, around the debate about female desire, Matthews rounds off her discussion of Blake and sexuality by tracing his take on the issue of adultery right through to the exhibition of 1809, with its focus on naked bodies and the juxtaposition of The Penance of Jane Shore and The Goats with The Spiritual Form of Nelson Guiding Leviathan.
 
Matthews’s book is a fierce, fascinating, and passionate response to the last thirty years in Blake studies; it revisits the debates initiated by the feminists to claim that Blake’s opinion of both gender and sexuality can only make sense if firmly placed into their historical linguistic context. Matthews successfully carves out a new area of investigation and convincingly presents a new Blake. Because this Blake blurs the boundaries of the very words and categories we (today) assess him with, he emerges from Blake, Sexuality and Bourgeois Politeness as an even more radical figure.

Morton Paley (mpaley@berkeley.edu) is co-editing The Reception of William Blake in Europe, to be published by Bloomsbury in 2016. He is continuing his work on the art of George Romney.
 
 
 
Blake’s Genesis is at the same time one of the best preserved and least known of his manuscripts. The reasons for both are closely related. Before its accession by the Huntington Library, it had only two owners—John Linnell and his family (Genesis 28) and Henry E. Huntington, passing from the first to the second via Christie’s sale of 15 March 1918, where it was bought for Huntington by the dealer George D. Smith. Its existence has posed something of a conundrum: eleven leaves, containing the text of the first three and a half chapters of Genesis in Blake’s hand, accompanied for the most part by rather faint pencil drawings, with two unfinished and somewhat enigmatic title pages in watercolor. As it was in the possession of Linnell when William Michael Rossetti saw it (Genesis 28), it may have been commissioned by Linnell. It is, however, odd that Linnell would do this when the great Dante series that Blake was painting for him was in progress, and no account of it appears in the detailed Blake-Linnell financial records. Scholarly attention to it has been sparse.Perhaps that is why this volume does not include a bibliography. There is, however, a useful, detailed index. After Rossetti’s brief remarks, it was touched on by Damon in 1924 (William Blake 218, 220-21). Piloo Nanavutty’s substantial article, limited in subject to the second title page, appeared in 1947. Robert Essick’s detailed description of the manuscript was published in his catalogue of the Huntington Blake collection in 1985. A few books, most recently my own Traveller in the Evening (260-66), discuss it briefly. An important essay, “Blake’s Illuminated Manuscript of Genesis,” by Robert R. Wark, intended for publication in 1974, appears here (17-22) for the first time, along with the editors’ own rich commentary and notes.One of the most respected scholars of his time in the field of British art, Wark was head of the Huntington Art Gallery from 1956 to 1990. The circumstances under which his essay came to exist only in two proof copies are recounted in Genesis 16. All eleven leaves are reproduced photographically in Martin Butlin’s great catalogue raisonné of Blake’s printings and drawings (#828.1-11), and they also appear on the Huntington Library’s web site, http://​emuseum.​huntington.​org, but this is the first facsimile ever to be published.
  
The Crosby-Essick edition begins, appropriately, with the facsimile itself. This is a beautiful piece of work, bringing out even very faint pencil lines, faithfully reproducing the delicate watercolors of the first two pages, and presenting the reader with pages of the size and approximate texture of the original. The editors’ commentary and notes appear in the last part of the book (23-51), and I will discuss these along with the images themselves, starting with the two title pages, one of which is considered a substitute for the other.
  
In the first title page we see a central male figure, legs apart, left arm reaching out to the side. He is naked, but the I of the title hides his genitals. There are faint vertical lines on the stem of the I, suggesting a Grecian column. The man has a large halo behind him, and his right arm is reaching up as far as it can. Above and to his right, a figure with a short beard extends his left arm out almost to the hand of the naked figure. He sits in a sphere, the arcing far end of which has been colored rose. At the top center, above the area between G and E, a being with his back to the viewer leaps athletically toward the right, arms and legs stretched out horizontally as if to emphasize his speed. At the three o’clock position is a white-bearded man, whose right arm reaches up like the central figure’s but whose hand is turned out flat, palm up, supporting what seems to be a wisp of cloud. His feet touch blue waves. Wearing a pale-blue gown, he stands in an ovoid nimbus. Near the bottom of the design are tongues of flame, and below these are four indistinctly sketched figures, of which three raise arms upward. Blue water flows on the left, with a little of it on the right, and the surface of the earth is on its way to becoming the greensward of the title page to come.
  
What is going on here? Even one unfamiliar with Blake would recognize the central figure as Adam, standing on a curve of the newly created earth. The three others, going clockwise, are Jesus, the Holy Ghost, and God the Father. Featuring the Trinity is unusual for Blake, as Damon (William Blake 220) observes; Crosby and Essick suggest this was the idea of Linnell, a Trinitarian Baptist. God the Father has separated the land from the sea, following Gen. 1.9-10: “And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appeare: and it was so. And God called the drie land, Earth, and the gathering together of the waters called hee, Seas: and God saw that [it was] good.” Blake’s rendition of the Father, however, is of a weak old man, stiff as a post. (Blake had trouble envisioning an admirable-looking Father: “First God Almighty comes with a Thump on the Head,” he wrote, “Then Jesus Christ comes with a balm to heal it.”)“[A Vision of the Last Judgment],” E 565. Jesus in contrast is young and strong, so strong that his left arm bursts out of the sphere he inhabits. His close-fitting body stocking is blue, in contrast to the Holy Ghost’s above, which is red, the color of caritas. The latter’s giant wings have been penciled but not reinforced in ink or colored. He leaps across the top of the picture space, arms and legs extended in the air. His head is not visible; what looks like a doodle of a bird (the traditional dove?) appears in its place. All save the bottommost figures can thus be identified with Adam and the Trinity.
  
This is, obviously, a scene of creation, in keeping with the Gothic-lettered title “GE/NE/SIS[.]” All four traditional elements are prominent: earth, air (emphasized by the Holy Ghost’s flight through space), water, and fire. Man is newly created (without, as yet, Eve), and Jesus reaches out toward Adam’s upraised hand, “in,” as the editors put it, “an act of physical and spiritual connection with Adam” (37). The drawing is not, however, entirely positive in effect, with the flames and the indistinct creatures below them, and what may be a powerful storm, indicated in gray and black, falling diagonally from near the first E down behind and below N. It may be that this was not the effect desired by patron and/or artist, for Blake produced a second title page. As Wark astutely comments: The first is dynamic, awesome, and sublime (in the eighteenth-century sense of the word); the second is balanced, benign, and beautiful. The first suggests gloom, enlivened only by hell-like fires, as the setting for Genesis; the second suggests something more akin to the traditional Eden. (Genesis 21)  

Indeed, one’s first impression of the second title page is of lush greenery. Adam now stands on a green earth, with two thick-trunked trees growing at the bottom of the design. The one at the left is presumably the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, with its invitingly rich fruit (although of course the Tree of Life was also fruited) (Gen. 3.22). The letters of the title are green and gold, and from some of them sprout plants, such as wheat, a symbol of fertility, growing from the G, and a rose-colored lily from the middle horizontal of the second E. Nanavutty 117 identifies the latter as the Turk’s cap lily, and says it is known among herbal writers as the lily of Calvary. The editors (39) accept her identifications, as they also do her suggestion that Blake could have found some of his flower images and their significations in Robert John Thornton’s Temple of Flora (1799-1807). Among other flower symbols identified are the sacred lotus with pods full of seed, and three roses signifying martyrdom. The Genesis title is rich in vegetation, some suggesting fecundity and others prefiguring Christ’s self-sacrifice.
  
Two persons of the Trinity are represented much as in the first title page, except that the Holy Ghost is uncolored and his head turned away from the viewer, and above and below the Father’s ovoid mandorla areas that previously were blue are now black. Jesus, however, is shown much differently. He stands upright, arms cruciform, wearing a diaphanous garment. From his left hand a scroll (the text of Genesis?) flows downward to the upreaching right hand of the still-haloed Adam. Below are the four figures we previously encountered, seated on the greensward between the two trees. Their heads are now much more distinct, although their bodies, which are human, remain merely sketched in. The leftmost, wearing a crown and scaly armor, has a grotesque human head. He is the only one still shown as reaching upward (with his left arm). Next is the stylized head of an eagle, also crowned. The third head is probably a (Chinese?) lion’s. Fourth comes an ox-headed being. These may be, as Damon (William Blake 220-21) suggests, “the four Evangelists, represented … as four demons.” The ox traditionally represents Luke, the lion Mark, and the eagle John. According to the editors  (40), “no beast is traditionally associated with St. Matthew,” but they note that “typological parallels with the Evangelical beasts may also lie behind Blake’s design, including the vision of a man, lion, ox, and eagle in Ezekiel 1:10.” These were the prototypes of widely diffused images of the four evangelists, with Matthew being the man, or sometimes a winged man who could also be identified as an angel (see, for example, Lefrançois). However, Blake has made this crowned being as grotesque as, or even more grotesque than, the other ones, with his scaly (or mailed?) arms, goggle eye, and outthrust tongue. Identifying these four does not explain their puzzling presence as caricatures, which no one has done to date.
  
One other question about both title pages remains unresolved. Why does the pillar-like I obscure Adam’s loins? It is unlikely that this was Blake’s choice. As lately as the inscription in Yah and His Two Sons he had written, “Art can never exist without Naked Beauty displayed” (E 275). Was this Linnell’s decision? Linnell had no objection to accepting commissions that involved painting out or altering nude figures by the prime practitioner of the Victorian nude, William Etty,See “Exhibition Notes” to the John Linnell exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, 17 July-4 November 2001, http://​www.​fitzmuseum.​cam.​ac.​uk/​gallery/​Linnell/​ExhibitionNotes.​htm. Accessed 6 Nov. 2012. and this could tie in with the possibility that it was Linnell who expurgated and partially obliterated some of the Four Zoas drawings (see Damon, William Blake 399). That could, however, have been done by someone else in Linnell’s household, and as Linnell died in 1882 and Genesis was auctioned in his estate sale in 1918, there was also a considerable interim during which someone else could have made these alterations.
  
The remaining nine leaves bear pencil drawings (with occasional touches of watercolor) as well as text. 3 shows above its “Chap: 1” heading God the Father flanked by a winged angel on either side. He reaches down with his left hand in a gesture that the editors compare (41) to the so-called Ancient of Days of the Europe frontispiece. (It also resembles the down-pointing arm of the central figure in plate 15 of The [First] Book of Urizen.) The emphasis on threesomes is continued in 4, with three winged angels below the first verse, and three soaring over the sea below the third. Leaping out of the waves is a “frolicsome cetacean” (41). A pencil design at the bottom is indistinct. Next, three figures, which Crosby and Essick identify as the Trinity (42), stand gesturing in 5, facing the newly created Adam, who holds his arms up in amazement. As the editors observe, this design is the tailpiece for chapter 1, as the first was the headpiece, and this arrangement, repeated for the following chapters, “conforms to eighteenth-century conventions for illustrated books” (35). The headpiece for chapter 2, 6, depicts the creation of Eve, a subject, as the editors point out, that Blake treated in a number of other paintings and drawings. This drawing is far from finished, so its details are subject to interpretation. Eve appears to have just emerged from the side of the supine Adam, with the Father behind him. To the left is a figure who may be Satan (42-43). Satan is not, of course, present at the creation of Eve in the Bible, but that would not have deterred Blake from representing him here, as a foreshadowing of things to come. Crosby and Essick remark: “All four beings complicit in the fall are represented” here (43). The tailpiece, 7, is another creation of Eve, but in this rendering she floats in the air above the sleeping Adam, and above her fly three winged figures in parallel formation, the one nearest us being the Father. Adam’s upper chest is wrapped in a band that may close the wound of Eve’s delivery. The editors compare the color-printed drawing Elohim Creating Adam (Butlin #289), in which the deity blindly gropes the head of his anguished creation. Here Blake’s vision of an inhuman and dehumanizing God closely approaches Robert Lowell’s in “The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket”: … cast up the time When the Lord God formed man from the sea’s slime And breathed into his face the breath of life, And blue-lung’d combers lumbered to the kill. The Lord survives the rainbow of His will.   

By 8 the Fall has already occurred, unpictured. Adam and Eve are now abjectly on their knees facing someone or something not clear enough to be identified. The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, the fruit of which they have eaten (a partly bitten one lies before Adam), stands before them, but Eve, at least, is not facing it. At the base of its trunk lies what could be the enormous head of a serpent, with its body training around the trunk, although when Blake draws serpents with out-of-scale heads, they are usually elongated rather than round as here. Although they have not yet put on coats of skins, Adam kneels so that his genitals are hidden, and Eve is in a Venus Pudica position (as the editors point out [44]). Since they already know good and evil, it cannot be that the couple is kneeling to the serpent; it is likely, as the editors conjecture (44), that the lines at the right are the beginnings of a sketch of God.
  
The tailpiece, 9, is the most unfinished of the drawings, and so its subject is not immediately evident. Crosby and Essick, however, argue convincingly on the basis of some of Blake’s other representations (44) that this sketch would have shown the expulsion from paradise. There can be little doubt about the subject of 10, in which a figure lies on the ground, another stands bowed over it, and a small-headed form flees at the right, with a giant being in the air pursuing him.Damon (A Blake Dictionary 152) suggests it is Abel’s ghost. Eve may also be represented in lines suggesting someone kneeling at the body’s head. The first murder much occupied Blake during his last years: it is the subject of his last illuminated book, The Ghost of Abel, and also of his 1826 tempera The Body of Abel Found by Adam and Eve (Butlin #806, Tate Britain, reproduced here as fig. 11). It may be, as he copied Blake’s earlier drawing on this subject in 1821 (Butlin 1: 481), that Linnell had a particular interest in it as well.
  
The theme of Blake’s final drawing is forgiveness. He chose to eliminate the end of Gen. 4.15, “lest any finding him, should kill him,” and his heading to chapter 4 concludes “and of the forgiveness of Sins written upon the Murderers forhead.” The ghost of Abel cries “Life for Life!” but Jehovah says “Lo I have given you a Lamb for an Atonement instead / Of the Transgres[s]or, or no Flesh or Spirit could ever Live” (1.14, 2.10-11, E 271-72). The mark the Lord puts upon Cain is a sign of God’s forgiveness, as is shown in Blake’s endpiece drawing for 11, where the Father bends over the kneeling youth and embraces him. Several traditional prototypes have been put forward for this design; the editors suggest and reproduce Rembrandt’s Return of the Prodigal Son. This powerful etching is indeed similar in form to Blake’s drawing, but Blake introduces a detail that is consistent with his own purpose: God kisses Cain’s forehead. Either the mark is being set in this manner, or God is kissing the mark, but in either case the point is the forgiveness of sins.
  
In writing out the text of Genesis, Blake created headings that cast the events of each chapter in the terms of his own myth.  These headings give the late Blake’s interpretation of what is really going on, not only in the text proper but also in the Authorized Version’s headings to each chapter. Because the AV is now often printed and read without its original chapter headings, the importance of these may not be realized. Some earlier English Bibles had been divisive among readers not only because of their translations but also because of their interpretive chapter headings, something the King James translators wanted to avoid. The AV headings were both an integral part of the text and set off from it, being printed in roman above the gothic of the text proper (Bobrick 237, 253). Blake would of course have been familiar with them, and drew upon them parodically for his own.

For his first chapter heading, “Chap: 1 / The Creation of the Natural Man,” Blake took, selectively, “[The creation] of Man in the Image of God” from the AV heading.What edition(s) of the Bible Blake owned is unknown, but as to what translation there can be little doubt. On 30 January 1803 he wrote to his brother James: “I read Greek as fluently as an Oxford scholar and the Testament is my chief master. astonishing indeed is the English Translation it is almost word for word and if the Hebrew Bible is as well translated which I do not doubt it is we need not doubt of its having been translated as well as written by the Holy Ghost” (E 727). I am not, of course, suggesting that Blake owned the first edition of the AV. Many subsequent editions retained the headings verbatim, as, for example, The Holy Bible, Containing the Old and New Testaments; Newly Translated out of the Original Tongues, and with the Former Translations Diligently Compared and Revised, by His Majesty’s Special Command. Appointed to be Read in Churches. Cambridge: Printed by John Archdeacon Printer to the University; and Sold by John Beecroft, John Rivington, Benjamin White, and Edward Dilly, in London; and T. and J. Merrill, in Cambridge, 1769. Blake’s “Natural Man,” bound by his five senses, is created of the Adamah, but not the Spiritual Man. This is a Pauline distinction: “But the naturall man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishnesse unto him: neither can he know [them], because they are spiritually discerned” (1 Cor. 2.14). (Compare Blake’s annotation to Wordsworth’s Poems of 1815: “I see in Wordsworth the Natural Man rising up against the Spiritual Man Continually” [E 665].) This distinction, also analogous to Swedenborg’s between the External and the Internal Man,Swedenborg’s commentary on Genesis had been republished in English as recently as 1802. Of the creation of Adam he writes: 94. Verse 7. To form man the dust from the ground, is to form his external man, which before was not man; for it is said, verse 5, that there was no man to till the ground: To breathe into his nostrils the breath of lives, is to give him the life of faith and love: By man’s being made a living soul is signified, that his external man was also made alive. 95. The life of the external man is here treated of; the life of his faith or understanding in the two former verses, and the life of his love or will in this verse. Heretofore the external man was unwilling to comply with and serve the Internal, being engaged in a continual combat with him, wherefore at that time the external was not a man; but now, being made celestial, the external beginneth to comply with and serve the internal, and in this case becometh a man, being so rendered both by the life of faith and the life of love; the life of faith prepareth him, the life of love maketh him to be a man. (Arcana Cœlestia 1: 144)This is, of course, a much more optimistic view than that of Blake’s Genesis. is typical of only the later Blake, in contrast to the devil’s monistic proverb in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1790) that “Man has no Body distinct from his Soul for that calld Body is a portion of Soul discernd by the five Senses. the chief inlets of Soul in this age” (E 34).
 
Blake’s heading for chapter 2 is “The Natural Man divided into Male and female, and of the Tree of Life and of the Tree of Good and Evil.” Here he focuses on the AV heading’s “17 The tree of knowledge onely forbidden … 21 The making of woman, and institution of Mariage.” Gen. 2.21 is the version in which woman is made out of Adam’s rib, in contrast to Gen. 1.27, where God creates them both together. Blake chooses the version from chapter 2 because it is an account of division, and of something lost. The next loss is asserted in Blake’s caption to “Chap. 3: Of the Sexual Nature and its Fall into Generation and Death.” Again, Blake echoes the AV heading selectively: “6 Mans shamefull fall … 16 The punishment of Mankind. 21 Their first clothing. 22 Their casting out of Paradise.” It is worth noting that the word “fall” does not occur in the text of Gen. 3, nor does it appear elsewhere in Genesis with reference to Adam and Eve. Generation will not occur until the next chapter, but the Lord God does pronounce his death sentence upon humanity in 3.19. Blake’s chapter 4 heading is “How generation and death took Possession of the Natural Man and of the forgiveness of Sins written upon the Murderers forhead.”E, usually careful to follow Blake’s orthography, has four capitalized words here that are lower case in Blake’s text (E 688). This adds a significant detail to both the AV heading and its text, which read, respectively: The birth, trade, and religion of Cain and Abel. 8 The murder of Abel. 9 The curse of Cain. And the LORD set a marke upon Cain, lest any finding him, should kill him. The mark completes the process begun by the murder itself, which Leonard Michaels (71), writing of Byron’s Cain, calls “identifying Cain to himself and his community as none other than Cain, the infamous Biblical murderer.” However, Blake has added an element of redemption for Cain that is in accord not with the biblical text, but with his own beliefs as expressed, for example, in Jerusalem 45.33-35, where Los says: If I should dare to lay my finger on a grain of sand In way of vengeance; I punish the already punishd: O whom  Should I pity if I pity not the sinner who is gone astray! (E 194) As in other aspects of the manuscript, this is very much William Blake’s Genesis.
  
The Crosby-Essick Genesis is both a splendid facsimile and an indispensable work of reference for Blake studies. It is also a beautiful book with clear, easily readable typography (something not to be underestimated in a folio-sized volume that necessarily had to be set two columns to the page). For Blake scholars, becoming familiar with it will be both a pleasure and a duty.

This is an imaginative, deeply learned, and passionately argued book. The thinking and writing are sustained throughout at exceptionally high levels. Complex and difficult but readable and clear, the book makes an original and important contribution to Blake studies, though its aims and interests are much broader and more ambitious. I will focus on Goldsmith’s approach to and interpretation of Blake, but since he uses Blake to explore larger concerns in literary theory, the field of emotion/affect studies, and the relation of critical thought to political theory and action, I take these into view. The thread that ties these areas together is the centrality of reading in modern culture, about which Goldsmith has innovative and insightful things to say.
 
The book opens with a provocation to historicist readings of Blake as antinomian radical and prophet against empire, asking “is our enthusiasm for Blake to be trusted?” (1). The question turns on another directed at Blake: why did he feel that his work had public importance when he had no audience to speak of? How did he maintain his “radical enthusiasm” in the face of obscurity? For Goldsmith, belief in Blake’s political radicalism rests on shaky evidence; it is supported by his alleged presence at the Gordon Riots in 1780 and his trial for sedition in 1804—in which he was acquitted of uttering antimonarchist sentiments—but these events are “striking exceptions” that stand out against a lifetime of “nonparticipation” (35). Blake never broke the law, was not an activist, and had no file with the Home Office. Goldsmith titles part 1 “Devil’s Party,” but he asks: “Is it possible to believe oneself a revolutionary devil while remaining harmless and inconsequential?” (48). His question is not as harsh or negative as it sounds: the answer is yes if one’s faculties are agitated to the point of making intellectual arousal “feel like action.” In such agitation, suggests Goldsmith, “the antinomian integrity of thinking for oneself is tantamount to a public good” (70-72). In this sense, questions concerning Blake’s or Blake scholarship’s enthusiasm open into a broader consideration of “critical agency” as practiced by intellectuals since the romantic period.
 
A special value of the book is Goldsmith’s extensive and perceptive reading in the field of affect studies as it has reshaped discussion in the humanities over the last decades, especially regarding the mind-body relation and the political dimension of human subjectivity. Goldsmith shows that recent Blake criticism participates in what he calls “a sustained, interdisciplinary ‘surge’ in the … study of emotion” (10), and the book is worth reading as a guide to this exciting work. An important feature of this field is its emphasis on the “anonymity” and “agency” of emotion, what Thomas Pfau refers to as the pre-discursive or “ontologically anterior” vitality of emotions said to “resist a subject’s ordinary means of self-identification” (17). Affects in the new literature are “anonymous” because they are involuntary, taking place below the threshold of cognition, prior to or beyond the formation of the Cartesian subject. In posing a challenge to “the self-protective fictions of identity,” functioning “as a source of estrangement rather than as a reassuring indication of familiar humanity,” they resemble Blake’s concept of self-annihilation, the enthusiastic state that is “the primary aim of his late prophecies” (17-18).
 
Goldsmith joins these concepts to the issue of critical agency through what he calls his “sharpest insight into Blake’s contradictions,” which derives from an “unexpected source”—Immanuel Kant’s The Conflict of the Faculties (1798). What interests Goldsmith most about this work is Kant’s evaluation of the French Revolution and Terror, particularly his concept of the “nonparticipant revolutionary spectator,” a figure who serves to displace the Jacobins as the true agent of the revolution as “a world-transforming event” (35). In a single decisive move, Kant transfers historical agency to a newly emergent public whose role is to keep watch and exercise critical judgment. From this point on, according to Kant, only the genuine enthusiasm of the independent critical thinker, and not the agency of direct action, makes progressive historical change possible. (35) Blake is Goldsmith’s foremost example of this new figure “whose critical engagements take on such urgency as to feel like actions themselves,” a move that renders Blake’s contradictions “more broadly representative of the modern progressive intellectual” (35). Armed with this thesis, Goldsmith explores the compensatory role of emotion in creating the sense of critical agency, though in an important methodological move he also argues that Blake puts this theory of “reading” into question by subjecting emotion to critique in turn.
 
If Kant is the theorist and Blake the exemplar, then Milton is the precursor for the revolutionary spectator (36), and an outstanding feature of Goldsmith’s book is its often brilliant treatment of the Blake-Milton relationship. Blake’s emotional aesthetic is “directly related” to his sense of sharing with Milton the task of sustaining hope in historical transformation in the face of “revolutionary disappointment.” “The urgent and anonymous emotions of critical engagement,” writes Goldsmith, “come to occupy the place vacated by a discredited revolutionary agency” (26). Goldsmith focuses on Blake’s visual interpretations of Samson Agonistes, primarily through a stimulating account of the evolution of Blake’s design “Albion Rose,” the versions of which, he says, culminate in the print’s final state (c. 1804). He compares the design with Blake’s drawing of Samson on the last page of his Night Thoughts illustrations (Night IX, page 119), which depicts Samson pulling down the pillars, one eye open directly across from Young’s text: “Virtue abounds in Flatterers, and Foes; / ’Tis Pride, to praise her; Penance to perform” (9.2419-20). Claiming that these lines echo Milton’s Samson Agonistes—“With inward eyes illuminated / His fierie vertue rouz’d / From under ashes into sudden flame” (lines 1690-92)—Goldsmith argues that Young’s negative take on “virtue” deflects attention from Samson’s act of violence in the same way as do Blake’s additions to the print of “Albion Rose.” These include an inscription that alludes to Samson’s laboring “at the Mill with Slaves” and a date (1780) that places Samson in the context of the Gordon Riots and American Revolution, bits of text that redirect our attention from the urgency of his act to “the lateral, slower motion of reading” (133). While the print may be more multivalent than Goldsmith allows, it is especially important to him because from the time of David Erdman’s “groundbreaking reading” in Prophet against Empire (1954) it has served as “an indispensable key to political readings of Blake” (84). And though Erdman does not associate “Albion Rose” with Samson at the temple, Goldsmith suggests that Erdman and later historicists follow Blake’s example in borrowing Samson’s strength while “transferring” his “heroic labor to the urgent but hesitant agency” (117) involved in critical reading.
 
In part 2, Goldsmith locates the origins of his idea of critical reading in the age of sensibility, whose literature emphasizes emotional intelligence in an idiom Blake both mobilizes and subjects to critique. Building on recent work by James Chandler, Jon Mee, and Susan Matthews, Goldsmith analyzes “On Anothers Sorrow” to show how Blake incorporates the discourses of sympathy and sentiment in order to unmask their social-cultural construction. On one hand, emotion cannot be subsumed by reason and so functions as “autocriticism” of the instrumental subject of enlightenment thought; on the other, emotions such as sympathy and pity “underwrite the norms of social and political life,” smoothing the exchanges of global commerce, and so must be “decomposed” by critical reading. In contrast to the “intelligent” emotions subject to self-control, Blake’s Jesus in the poem demands no accountability and performs no action but a “dilatory” and “immoderate” capacity to empathize, to sit and listen eternally, refusing to appropriate another’s sorrow for any agenda whatsoever—except perhaps for critical reading (199-209).
 
How does this Jesus comport with the antinomian radical who acts from impulse, not from rules, in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell? They must be read together, each confounding the “ordinary distinctions between activity and passivity” (229) and so eluding narrative time altogether. Goldsmith brings his view of this impulsive yet infinitely patient Jesus to bear on the celebrated text on time near the end of the first book of Milton, marshaling the major threads of his argument in an imaginative and sensitive reading of the “pulsation of an artery” passage (28.44-29.3, E 126-27). A review cannot do justice to the profound learning and energetic thinking Goldsmith bestows on the passage. Suffice it to say that the idea in the passage accords with the postmodern “disappearance of an identifiable human subject” (234) as the pulsations of life tend to render us “strangers in our own bodies” (235-36). Goldsmith thus adds considerably to discussions about Blake and the body and strengthens support for an immanent rather than transcendent Blake.
 
In the final chapter, “Criticism and the Work of Emotion,” Goldsmith puts into question his argument about the “intimacy between criticism and feeling,” asking as he did of Blake’s enthusiasm how we know to trust “agitations irreducible to concepts” (272-73). He draws on Jean-Paul Sartre’s The Emotions: Outline of a Theory (1939)—which both affirms and distrusts the transformative potential of emotion—and on Jacques Derrida’s late work, especially Specters of Marx (1993) and The Politics of Friendship (1994), the latter recording Derrida’s lone reference to Blake. Of particular importance is Derrida’s “performative interpretation” of Marx’s eleventh thesis on Feuerbach, the injunction not just to interpret the world but to change it. A performative interpretation transforms or changes the text/​event that it engages, as when Derrida reads the communist specter haunting Europe as a “promise” that remains fundamentally indeterminate, that must “exceed and surprise every determinant anticipation” (Specters 251). This “structure of experience” applies also to the promise of revolution or the coming of the messiah, both of which require “a waiting without expectation” (“Marx and Sons” 248-49). For Goldsmith, the crucial point is that Derrida “collapses any distinction between the formal action of Marx’s writings and the reader’s affective, even somatic response, making it impossible to locate revolt in one or the other exclusively” (288). True to his self-reflective method, however, Goldsmith warns that the transformative potential of affective reading may be an indulgent fantasy, “a product of specialized, professional labor” constrained by socio-economic conditions (302). He thus counterposes Derrida’s messianic structure with Sartre’s theory of emotion.
 
As Goldsmith explains, Sartre identifies two main types of emotion, each performing a kind of “magic” that transforms the self: those “that emanate from us and others that happen to us, with the latter pointing to sources outside our own subjectivity” (306). The first type supplies immediate, embodied evidence that critical thinking can change the world, specifically when the critic or when history has reached an impasse: a failed revolution or discredited apocalypse. One’s enthusiasm in such a moment amounts to a kind of magic that Sartre says is based totally on subjective life, not on the outside world that denies the desire for transformation. The second type of emotion comes from outside the self and “reveals itself to consciousness as magical instead of determined” (308), confronting the subject as something other than its own will or agency. This second emotion enables Goldsmith to interrogate the “implicit claims of affective agency in order to decouple emotion from the promise of empowerment” (Goldsmith, “William Blake and the Future of Enthusiasm” 453). He offsets Derrida’s messianic structure of experience with what Sartre describes as “an existential structure of the world” (308). Yet if he counters Derrida with Sartre, he also remains committed to the principle of indeterminacy: not the indeterminacy that critics impose on an intransigent and over-determined world in order to interpret and change it, but a “second indeterminacy—if it exi[s]ts at all”—that transcends human mentality and reveals itself through the object (308-09). The Derridean phrase “if it exists” suggests that Goldsmith reads Sartre through Derrida and that what may be at stake is not Blake’s politics but the burden of the postmodern subject looking to escape the hegemony of the sign. The decentered subject gains an implicit authenticity through those affective agitations and intensities that open up an interiority “outside” the processes of subjection (or subjectification in postmodern parlance).
 
As with any book, even one as self-aware and knowledgeable as this one, several limitations can be noted. For one, despite its historical range and theoretical sophistication, the book does not add much to readings of any of Blake’s major poems. In this sense it recalls Leo Damrosch’s similarly provocative and challenging Symbol and Truth in Blake’s Myth (1980), a work also focused on the productive value of Blake’s contradictions. For another, the book seems to generalize a point Kant makes about the failure of the Jacobin-led revolution to all revolution and perhaps to political action as well. One can practice the enthusiastic reading that Goldsmith observes in Erdman, Mee, Saree Makdisi, and others without confining political participation to the groves of academe. In related terms, Goldsmith says that Blake’s Jesus is modeled on the self-sacrificing Passion of Christ, but we get a Jesus who does not risk provoking the violence of the state, as he does in The Four Zoas, Jerusalem, and The Everlasting Gospel. Finally, Goldsmith’s questions about political agency in Blake and tensions within his conceptions of revolutionary violence have been anticipated and addressed in Christopher Hobson’s The Chained Boy: Orc and Blake’s Idea of Revolution (1999), a book also indebted to the school of Joseph Wittreich, a pioneer of Milton-Blake studies whose engagement with Milton’s revolutionary legacy deeply informs Goldsmith’s argument. Hobson offers a critical, historically nuanced account of Blake’s revolutionary thinking that does not reject populist violence as an option in his work, a reading that Goldsmith does not consider.
 
Blake’s Agitation thus can be placed within a subfield inaugurated by Wittreich nearly forty years ago with Angel of Apocalypse: Blake’s Idea of Milton (1975), including works by Leslie Tannenbaum, Jackie DiSalvo, Stephen Behrendt, Hobson, and this reviewer among others that engage Blake’s relationship to Milton and to the revolutionary currents of his own age. Yet Goldsmith’s book stands out for its larger aims and concerns, even as it advances discussion of Blake’s enthusiasm, fulfills an important need for studies of Blake’s relation to sensibility, and goes further than any previous study in exploring contradictions in Blake’s work. Indeed, the book has the enviable potential to make Blake available to a larger audience than most Blake specialists can reach. In this sense, its focus on a limited number of passages in Blake’s work may prove to its advantage. We might end by citing Goldsmith’s own praise of a fellow romanticist’s book: “its monumental scope and complexity lie well beyond anything that can be treated justly in this brief engagement” (14).

In 2014 G. E. Bentley, Jr., (gbentley@chass.utoronto.ca) published William Blake in the Desolate Market (McGill–Queen’s University Press) and essays in Blake and Notes and Queries. In the press are The Edwardses of Halifax, 2 vols. (University of Toronto Press, expected in 2015) and essays in Blake and Notes and Queries. “William Blake and His Circle” and “Sale Catalogues of Blake’s Works, 1791-2014” were significantly expanded online.

Martin Butlin (London: Folio Society, 2013).
 
Blake’s 116 enormous watercolors illustrating the Poems by Mr. Gray (1790) were commissioned in 1797 by “My Dearest Friend” John Flaxman as a gift for Flaxman’s wife, Nancy. The price was apparently £10.10.0G. E. Bentley, Jr., Blake Records, 2nd ed. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) [hereafter BR(2)] 246. or 1s. 10d. per design. Nancy Flaxman may have shown the drawings to a few friends,The Rev. Joseph Thomas asked to see them in 1805 (BR[2] 207). and presumably they were visible when they were sold with Flaxman’s collection at Christie’s, 1 July 1828, lot 85 (£8.8.0), but none of Blake’s contemporaries save the Flaxmans is known to have seen them. They were rediscovered in 1919,H. J. C. Grierson, “Blake’s Designs for Gray. Discovery in Hamilton Palace,” Times 4 Nov. 1919: 15. They were erratically recorded by W. M. Rossetti in Alexander Gilchrist, Life of William Blake (1863) 2: 255 (114 designs) and (1880) 2: 275 (118 designs). and since then there have been a surprising number of reproductions of the whole series: 1922 William Blake’s Designs for Gray’s Poems, Reproduced Full-Size in Monochrome or Colour [six designs] from the Unique Copy Belonging to His Grace the Duke of Hamilton. With an introduction by H. J. C. Grierson. London, 1922.

Which of these should be given the accolade of a true facsimile? I take facsimile to mean an exact copy attempting very close reproduction of an original named copy, including size of image, color of printing (and of tinting if relevant), and size, color, and quality of paper, with no deliberate alteration as in page order or numbering or obscuring of paper defects or centering the image on the page.This statement, or one very like it, appears in the annual checklists of “William Blake and His Circle” in Blake (1994 ff.). This standard excludes the editions of 1922, 1971 (two), and 1996 because they are in monochrome, and those of 1971 (two), 1996, and 2000 because they are radically reduced in size. And there is no paper at all in the electronic versions of 2005 and 2012.
 
This leaves only the Blake Trust edition (1972) and the Folio Society edition (2013). In the Blake Trust edition the reproductions are printed only on one side of the leaf, unlike the originals, which are printed on both recto and verso. The Folio Society differs from the original in not printing the inset printed text on paper different from the surrounding watercolors.
 
In the color reproductions of 1922, 1972, and 2013, the outlines and the basic shapes seem identical. The chief differences are in the coloring.Of course every copy of the Blake Trust edition (1972) differs from the others because it was hand finished by the colorists. Presumably other copies differ from the Victoria University copy I examined. But each copy of the Grierson (1922) and Folio Society (2013) editions should be like every other copy of the same edition.

I conclude that none of these printed works is a facsimile. They can be compared in images with the excellent online color reproductions of the Yale Center for British Art and the William Blake Archive, but these of course are intangible and give no sense of facing images, etc. Of the three, the Folio Society edition seems to me distinctly the most reliable. The fidelity of the Folio Society reproductions is indicated by the show-through of printed text from the other side of the leaf.
 
Blake’s drawings are amazingly sure—there was no room for new leaves, no spit-backs. Many of the designs represent stupendous figures such as “Father Thames” (p. 56), “the fury passions” (p. 58), “the painful family of Death” (p. 60), “the bard” (p. [95]), and “Hyperion” (p. 86) (see illus. 1). 

 
1. “Hyperion,” p. 86 (32.5 x 42 cm., much reduced here). “Hyperion’s … glitt’ring ſhafts of war” anticipate The Rout of the Rebel Angels (1807, 1808) for Paradise Lost book 6, in which Christ in the sun with bow and arrow drives the rebel angels downward.

 
Notice that Hyperion’s finger is not guiding the arrow. In The Rout of the Rebel Angels (Thomas and Butts sets), the arrow is not guided by a finger, but in Blake’s engraving of “Gods and Titans” for Flaxman’s Hesiod (1817), the bow-finger is correctly guiding the arrow.

  Among these titans are some charming vignettes, such as the flying builders of Gothic churches (p. [65]) and “the laughing flowers” (p. [83]) (see illus. 2). 
 
2. “The laughing flowers,” p. [83] (bottom left corner, 19 x 16.5 cm.). Angelic figures collect water from “Helicon’s harmonious ſprings” to nourish personified flowers.

The Folio Society edition is full of incidental delights. On p. [158], Blake’s poem to Nancy Flaxman, across “William Blake,” are four very clear brown fingerprints,Fingerprints are formed from sweat from the endocrine glands or from ink or other viscous substances impressed from the friction ridges of fingers. Dermatoglyphics, the systematic study of fingerprints, is a creation of the late nineteenth century. In 1858 Sir William James Herschel initiated the use of fingerprint records in India, and in Mark Twain’s Life on the Mississippi (1883) a killer is identified by his thumbprint. The fingerprints are clear in the Blake Trust and Folio Society editions but barely visible in that of Grierson. They are clear but not commented on in the online reproductions of the William Blake Archive and the Yale Center for British Art. See my discussion of Blake’s fingerprints on text pages for Gray in “William Blake and His Circle,” Blake 48.1 (summer 2014): pars. 6-7 of the introductory essay and Part I, Section A, under Inscriptions on Designs. the right hand, I think, which are on top of the writing, after the writing ink had dried (see illus. 3). 

 
3. Four fingerprints vertically across “William Blake” on Blake’s poem to Nancy Flaxman, p. [158] (5.1 x 12.7 cm.). They are clearly on top of the writing. Probably they are those of the poet. No other example of his fingerprint is known outside the Gray designs.

 The color of the fingerprints seems to derive from animal glue. If so, they almost certainly were added in the process of gluing the printed leaves of Gray (1790) to the large leaves for Blake’s watercolors. Since the fingerprints are on top of Blake’s poem, this suggests that the printed leaves were glued to the design leaves after the watercolors were finished. 
It is very probable that the fingerprints belong to William Blake, but Catherine is also a possibility. They make one feel very close to the artist. Morton Paley points out to me that even more interesting than the presence of these fingerprints may be their absence elsewhere. Both painters and printers handle ink, and they frequently have inky fingers. Why aren’t there more fingerprints on Blake’s works? I guess that master engravers and painters were pretty severe with apprentices who left fingerprints.

London: Folio Society, 2013. 15.6 x 27.8 cm., xiv, 210 pp., one reduced monochrome illustration, no ISBN. Published to accompany the Folio Society facsimile (2013). Butlin, “Foreword” (vii-x), says that he has altered the references to Blake’s writings in the 1971 printing from the edition of Geoffrey Keynes to that of D. V. Erdman and the references to contemporary texts to G. E. Bentley, Jr., Blake Records, 2nd ed. (2004), that he has given more accessible references to reproductions of Blake’s art than in the 1971 edition, and that he has added footnotes signed “M.B.,” a “List of Works Cited” (203-05), and a “Supplementary Bibliography” (206-07). “Irene Tayler’s text is still the most satisfactory introduction to the subtleties of Blake’s illustrations to the poems of Gray” (ix).

What New Is There to Learn from Old Familiars? Burning Bright: William Blake and the Art of the Book. John Rylands Library, University of Manchester, 8 February–23 June 2013.
 
Reviewed by Sibylle Erle
 
Sibylle Erle (sibylle.erle@bishopg.ac.uk), FRSA, is senior lecturer in English at Bishop Grosseteste University Lincoln, author of Blake, Lavater and Physiognomy (Legenda, 2010), co-editor of Science, Technology and the Senses (special issue for RaVoN, 2008), and volume editor of Panoramas, 1787-1900: Texts and Contexts (5 vols., Pickering and Chatto, 2012). With Morton D. Paley she is now co-editing The Reception of William Blake in Europe (Bloomsbury). She has co-curated the display Blake and Physiognomy (2010-11) at Tate Britain and devised an online exhibition of Tennyson’s copy of Blake’s Job for the Tennyson Research Centre (2013). Apart from reception, she is working on “character” in the romantic period.
 
 
 
The discovery of new etchings in Manchester made international headlines in January 2013. In Britain on Monday the 21st the Independent reported, “Hundreds of Lost William Blake Etchings Discovered at a Manchester Library.” The article, written by Nick Clark, said, “researchers … stumbled upon a treasure trove” when they “found about 350 engraved plates designed by Blake.” The treasure-hunt language can be traced back to the web pages of the John Rylands Library and therefore essentially the press office of the University of Manchester. This publicity caused a few ripples but the excitement was short lived, as the “discovery” applied to the stacks of the library rather than the works known to have been created by Blake. Still, what happens to Blake in the public sphere matters.

The dark temporary exhibition space on the first floor of the late nineteenth-century Gothic building of the library not only contained these recently rediscovered treasures—the exhibition booklet said “some exciting new finds from the Library’s collections” and the display board “many of these works have previously lain undetected”—but also and more importantly showed a large collection of Blake’s commercial art. In addition, the display contextualized the reception of Blake’s craftsmanship by juxtaposing designs with images by the Ancients, the Pre-Raphaelites, and the members of the Arts and Crafts movement, such as Samuel Palmer, William Holman Hunt, and Walter Crane, as well as a facsimile published by William Muir and an example of a newly illustrated edition—a Blake poem illustrated by Jacynth Parsons from the 1927 edition of Songs of Innocence published by the Medici Society. The mixture of books, sheets, designs, and images resonated with what this Blake exhibition was about: the art of the book.
 
Burning Bright occupied three rooms because it spilled into the adjacent Spencer and Crawford Rooms. It was curated by the archives and visual materials manager, Stella Halkyard, and grew out of Colin Trodd’s Visions of Blake: William Blake in the Art World 1830-1930 (2012) as well as the efforts of his students, who, after receiving special training on prints, etchings, and engravings, found what was on display. Was Burning Bright throwing new light on Blake? How excited should we still be? The answer is—a bit. “Burning Bright” is, of course, a familiar expression, used twice in Blake’s “The Tyger” (1794): “Tyger Tyger, burning bright, / In the forests of the night; / What immortal hand or eye, / Could frame thy fearful symmetry?” The last stanza repeats the first but changes the last line to “Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?” (E 24-25). In the section on John Gabriel Stedman’s Narrative, of a Five Years’ Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam, in Guiana, on the Wild Coast of South America; from the Year 1772, to 1777 (1796), the exhibition booklet quoted Stedman on the “tyger-cat” whose eyes sparked “flashes like lightning” (11). A sense of audacity, I think, was maintained and creatively constructed in the display. The story to be told in this review is how the display handled, or rather could be seen to resist, the discovery narrative imposed through the media, because Burning Bright made a statement about the legacy of Blake’s art (it said “creative impact” on the board).
 
The language of a supposed treasure hunt through the stacks of the library was countered directly by the image on the board at the entrance: we saw one of the explorers, equipped with a magnifying glass, poring over the pages of Illustrations of the Book of Job. In view of the treasure narrative it was surprising that this explorer didn’t wear white gloves and that her pendant, hanging on a long necklace, was touching the pristine page. I couldn’t tell how excited she was, since she stared intently at the image in front of her. I had to admit grudgingly to myself that I envied her the access and proximity to the physical object. To remedy this lack or loss, the John Rylands offered all visitors a session on a computer, where I could use—as she did—a magnifying tool to study this book, as well as Blake’s Night Thoughts, page by page and close up. That the library digitized both Illustrations of the Book of Job and the hand-colored copy of Night Thoughts and has made them available online may be a small solace to all of you who will want to examine these specific copies. At the entrance, opposite the board with that posed photograph, we were introduced to Blake. On this particular board the emphasis was on Blake the visionary poet, which is one of many Blakes we could have had: it said, “by the age of eight Blake was already showing signs of visionary spirituality,” and next to it a little pink boy, one of Blake’s many images of children, served as a reminder that boys and not girls had to cope with wearing pink in the eighteenth century.
 
Burning Bright showcased a selection of the Blake collection at the John Rylands, but it seemed that none of what was on display was actually new; that is, there was no work of art that had not previously been listed in G. E. Bentley, Jr.’s Blake Books (1977) and Blake Books Supplement (1995) or Robert N. Essick’s William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations (1991), though the show included some newly discovered copies of works with his commercial engravings, most of which have since been included in Bentley’s annual checklists in Blake and the online compilation of those lists, “William Blake and His Circle.” There may be small adjustments to be made. Bentley, for example, doesn’t say that Stedman’s Narrative at the John Rylands is colored (see BBS p. 255). On the top shelf of the first vitrine there was a copy of William Hayley’s Ballads (1805), which was opened to show “The Lion,” facing p. 100 and illustrating “The Lion. Ballad the Nineth [sic].” Next to it sat Hayley’s Triumphs of Temper, which, according to its label, was illustrated with plates engraved by Blake after Maria Denman. The label, in other words, contradicted the title page, which attributes the designs to Maria Flaxman, John Flaxman’s half-sister. (Maria Denman was Flaxman’s wife’s sister, who was known as Maria Flaxman after John and Ann Flaxman adopted her.) On display was the newly illustrated twelfth edition of the work, published in 1803. This edition, with six plates engraved by Blake, is sufficiently rare to deserve some commentary. As Mark Crosby discusses, the work had previously been illustrated with seven engravings after Thomas Stothard, and Blake’s plates were used in only two editions, 1803 and 1807, but not in any subsequent ones because of wear (123). He argues further that John Flaxman and Lady Harriet Hesketh were disappointed with the published plates, even though Blake and Hayley had “edited” the drawings together (111-12). Crosby suggests that Hayley must have liked the proofs that Blake would have printed. He thinks that Hayley sent the plates to London to be printed: “If Blake or Catherine had been responsible for printing the plates, it is highly likely that they would have spotted the imperfection [on pl. 6] and corrected it” (123). Bentley lists this copy under “Manchester” in the online “William Blake and His Circle.” Robert Blair’s The Grave (1808), which was displayed on the bottom shelf, is known too, and Bentley had previously found a copy of “unrecorded format” in the Whitworth Art Gallery (see BB p. 526).
 
The second vitrine had George Cumberland’s Thoughts on Outline (1796) and Mary Wollstonecraft’s Original Stories (1796) at the top, and Jacob Bryant’s A New System, or an Analysis of Ancient Mythology (1774-76) and Stedman’s Narrative below. The Cumberland, not listed in BBS, is included in the online “William Blake and His Circle,” and the Manchester Bryant was already listed in BBS (p. 203). According to BBS (pp. 264-65), the John Rylands owns copies of both the 1791 and 1796 editions of Wollstonecraft’s Original Stories. Here we could see what is special about the later edition: the frontispiece has been cut and pasted—not printed—onto the page facing the title page. Bentley does not comment on this feature, which might suggest that it is an anomaly, though this should surely tell us something about the art of the book. But the label was silent.
 
The second vitrine was the most thought provoking, I think, because of a plate from Bryant’s New System (vol. 2, facing p. 410). The label indicated, as was to be expected, that Blake probably engraved a small number of its plates when he was apprenticed to James Basire in the 1770s. It also said that “Bryant’s writing had a profound impact on Blake and formed an important source and inspiration for the symbolic systems he developed in his own works.” This point is easy to support, because Blake referred to Bryant when he talked about antiquities in his description of The Ancient Britons in A Descriptive Catalogue (1809). It is impossible to know for sure which plates might have been engraved by Blake (see Essick 117 and BB p. 537). The plate depicts four figures, three of which have animal heads. What the impact on Blake may have been I realized once I had moved on to the next vitrine, which contained Robert Thornton’s edition of Virgil’s Pastorals (1821) and Erasmus Darwin’s The Botanic Garden (1791), because the second figure in the Bryant plate, identified as Hermes and compared to Osiris, was echoed by the dog-headed Anubis figure from “Fertilization of Egypt” as engraved by Blake after Henry Fuseli for Darwin. The Hermes/Osiris figure in Bryant has a human head with wavy hair and an elongated snout of a dog; the crocodile that he is holding down with his left foot has a beak with teeth. The crocodile is a sacred animal associated with the Nile. It was tempting to indulge this visual parallel between the illustrations for Bryant’s New System and Darwin’s The Botanic Garden, but unfortunately the more we think about it the less it will stand up. This is because the Anubis figure is in Fuseli’s sketch of “Fertilization of Egypt.” The label involuntarily raised the question of Blake’s input into his commercial engravings. While he would have followed the instructions and guidance of Basire in the 1770s, it is more than likely that he followed Fuseli’s when working on the plate for The Botanic Garden. There is more. Essick (46-47), who examines “Fertilization of Egypt,” discusses the plate’s relationship with the text and documents that the winged floating figure originates in Fuseli’s sketch. The exhibition label, however, asserted that “the bearded rain-god displayed here is entirely Blake’s invention.” That Fuseli gave Blake a free hand when he was working up the sketch is probable, but this notion doesn’t reveal how close they were, how often they met, and indeed how Fuseli treated his engravers (on their relationship, see Todd). The exhibition label, in short, made a bold and unsubstantiated claim. What we know for sure is that the two drawings, Fuseli’s and Blake’s, show this rain god (see Essick pls. 68 and 69). Bentley lists the 1791 as well as the 1795 editions of The Botanic Garden, but the copy of Virgil’s Pastorals is not listed anywhere, which means that we are technically dealing with a discovery.
 
The sense of disappointed excitement continued as I walked through to Illustrations of the Book of Job (Spencer Room) and Night Thoughts (Crawford), the highlights of Burning Bright. In their edition of the Night Thoughts designs, Grant et al. have already documented the John Rylands copy. They draw attention to the quality of the coloring and point out that this copy was most likely colored by Blake as well as his wife, Catherine (1: 53). The information in the Crawford Room was vague because label and board contradicted each other: one ascribed the coloring to Blake, the other to the husband and wife team. The huge book and its wonderful designs stopped me in my tracks. The book was open at pages 72 and 73, revealing an image of Christ on the right-hand side. The figure is walking with actual nails sticking out of red-rimmed wounds in his hands and feet (the wound in his right foot is obscured). He is wearing a crown of thorns and drops of blood are running down his forehead. Christ is looking down and reaching out to someone on his left who is outside the image. Grant et al. also note that the copy belonged to the second Earl Spencer, George John Spencer (1758-1834), before it came to the John Rylands (1: 66). When she decided to have a memorial library built for her husband, John Rylands’s widow bought the Spencer collection as part of its foundation. The bookplate dates the acquisition to 1894, which means that the acquisition of Night Thoughts preceded the official opening of the library by six years.
 

 
As I walked into the Spencer Room, I encountered Illustrations of the Book of Job. It is one of the one hundred copies printed on drawing paper in March 1826 by James Lahee for John Linnell. We could look at plate “14,” “When the morning Stars”; the paper was in very good condition. According to the label, Illustrations of the Book of Job was published by Blake in 1825. This date, of course, originates from the imprint and is incorrect. The label also named the students who discovered the copy; it suggested that this was the main find of the Blake project carried out at the library, and the display board spoke of “Blake’s ‘[as] exquisitely engraved as grandly conceived’ masterpiece.” The story to be told here is about the previous owner. A lot of work has been done on Blake collectors already, and this one deserves more attention. According to the bookplate (which could be accessed via the computer in the Crawford Room), this Job was presented to the John Rylands by Richard Hawkin, Esq., of Darwen in Lancashire. Hawkin, who became friends with Edward Carpenter (1844-1929), the social and gay rights campaigner, settled in York, where he stood as the Labour candidate during the local municipal elections (having been nominated by the York Labour Representation Committee) for Monk Ward on 2 November 1903. He campaigned for a housing reform to benefit workers, a municipal cemetery, and playgrounds. Hawkin was present at the inauguration of the Guild of Freemen of the City of York on 9 September 1953 and published A History of the Freemen of the City of York in 1955. Judging from the Bulletin of the John Rylands Library, by the time Hawkin died in 1968, he had been a generous donor for many years; his collection included ninety-two volumes relating to Blake—facsimiles of the works as well as biographies and literary studies—many materials about Yorkshire, and also a “small selection of anarchist literature … and pamphlets relating to the anti-slavery movement” (2). In the “Notes and News” section at the beginning of the Bulletin the unidentified editors evidently wrongly assumed that the Job was, like the other works by Blake in Hawkin’s possession, a facsimile (3).
 

 
The remainder of the temporary exhibition space was filled with books about Blake (Gilchrist, Swinburne, Yeats and Ellis), about ten books by artists and writers influenced by Blake, and finally Muir’s facsimile of Songs of Innocence and Parsons’s illustration to Blake’s “The Little Black Boy.” Fascinating materials: compelling visual parallels. It became clear, for example, that plate “14” (“When the morning Stars”) from Job inspired Crane, who reproduced the angelic figures in Line and Form (1900), because in the margin of the book, open at pages 18 and 19, Crane acknowledges his source.
 
In her blog entry of 14 January 2013 (John Rylands Library Special Collections blog), Halkyard wrote that the researchers “uncover[ed] a significant hoard of books containing designs and engravings,” which, “due to their dispersal across our collections … have previously lain undetected.” In the next sentence she talked about “‘finds.’” I appreciated the single quotation marks but want to stress that what was extraordinary about this display was the freshness of the ink and color of the images in the books. I looked at them with admiration: they hadn’t been opened in many years, and the golden upper-arm bands in “Europe Supported by Africa and America” from Stedman’s Narrative burnt brightly in the dark and filled my eyes. Halkyard, too, by the way, used such a metaphor when she described the impact Blake has had on those who came after him. Manchester was well worth a visit.

Carl-Johan Malmberg has written a large book of about 450 pages on Blake generally, concentrating on what Jean Hagstrum called Blake’s composite art, his unique illuminated printing from copperplates on which text, image, and decoration stand up in relief and can be printed like woodcuts. The writer thinks that the question whether Blake was greatest as a poet or as a pictorial artist presupposes the idea that poetry is something distinct from painting, but Blake seems to have looked upon both as one thing, which he called “art.” Malmberg is up to date on recent Blake scholarship, knows Morton Paley personally, and has corresponded with Bob Essick. The book is beautifully printed, proofread with reasonable accuracy, and richly illustrated. In a final chapter there is a short summary of Blake’s life, but the book is mainly criticism, not biography. Informative notes are in the margins, including the original wording of scholars quoted in translation.
  
This is the first book on Blake in Swedish. There are, of course, articles, mostly general, and translations, some quite bad. I do not know of a single Blake original in a Swedish collection. Blake’s works have never been exhibited in Sweden, but in 2000 many Blakes from the British Museum were shown in Finland, at the Helsinki City Art Museum. Finland is a bilingual country and Helsinki a bilingual city, so David Bindman’s catalogue was translated into Finnish and Swedish. Otherwise Swedes have been forced to go to Britain or to America to see originals and required to read English if they wanted substantial information about Blake.
  
But why has Malmberg chosen to publish his book in Swedish? In English the writer would have reached a wide international audience, while Swedes interested in Blake can be assumed to be able to read a book written in English. Maybe Malmberg just wanted to introduce Blake to his own people in their own language.
  
Malmberg understands the complexities of Blake’s poetry and images, and quotes Blake literature generously, recent and old. Blake scholars are mostly quoted in Swedish, Blake himself in English. The present reviewer is particularly grateful for a quote before the text from Northrop Frye’s Fearful Symmetry, to the effect that Blake’s poetical works may need interpretation, but not deciphering: “There can be no ‘key’ and no open-sesame formula and no patented system of translation.” When I read Frye in the mid-fifties, I missed this warning. As a consequence, I lost several years trying to “make sense” of Blake by translating his poetry into reasoned stories, a Urizenic task I dutifully forced myself to perform. Before I knew Frye I had not so much worried about “understanding” Blake, I just enjoyed reading him. Afterwards I was suspicious of interpreting poetry and images for many years. It took me a long time to see that it is possible to interpret Blake without trying to rewrite his poetry into pedantic prose.
  
The Swedish title means The Star in the Foot: Poetry and Image, Book and Thought in William Blake. The first part of the title refers, of course, to plates 14, 29, and 33 of the poem Milton, where John Milton enters the feet of William Blake and his brother Robert, inspiring them and so helping Blake’s illuminated poem into existence.
  
The book is divided into several chapters. After a short introduction, “Into the Labyrinth,” follow sections on “Albion Rose,” “The Ancient of Days,” Newton, the Songs, Jah and His Two Sons Satan and Adam, “A Woman Scaly and a Man all Hairy,” and Jerusalem. At the end there is a short summary of Blake’s life and times, a select bibliography, a list of illustrations, and an index of names.
  
Malmberg’s analysis of “Albion Rose,” which he calls an agonistic icon, is excellent. It is true that Blake is agonistic, in the sense that he is prone to exceed his predecessors in a creative way. Thus “Albion Rose” is the most typical Blake you can find, and this is especially true of the uncolored line engraving. Incidentally, I think that the date 1780 is a survivor from the first state, later almost completely reworked and obliterated. And Lionardo’s Vitruvian Man is closer to Blake than Malmberg thinks. Lionardo drew him in two positions, one spread eagled, circumscribed by a circle with its center in the navel. But the position with the arms stretched out horizontally is inscribed in a quadrate with its center at the base of the sexual organ, exactly as in “Albion Rose.” Blake seems to have known Lionardo’s drawing.
  
In his discussion of “The Ancient of Days,” Malmberg appropriately quotes Detlef Dörrbecker to the effect that the print shows not only the making of the universe in general, but more specifically the creation of measurable space. Newton holds the same golden compasses as the Ancient of Days, and both use their left hand. Malmberg has a good section on Newton as God.
  
The section on the Songs is long (116 pages), sound, and ends with some interesting remarks on Blake’s use of gold. The author knows that the Songs of Experience existed in Blake’s mind and in his Notebook already in 1789, when he etched the Songs of Innocence, although Experience was not published until 1794. Malmberg has chosen for commentary poems that interest him, such as “The Chimney Sweeper” from Innocence and “London” from Experience. Today it is difficult to understand how nineteenth-century commentators could believe that Blake was an uneducated person who was under the misapprehension that “chartered” meant something like “mapped out,” an interpretation that would make nonsense of the poem. One time in London in the mid-sixties I walked along a street and noticed the sign “Chartered Turf Accountants,” and thought that I wandered through a “charter’d street.” I understood that Blake must have had a similar experience, of a society in which businesses were protected by royal charters but people were left to suffer and die. Malmberg understands that Blake’s “London” is meant to be seen as well as heard, and subjects the minute particulars of the illuminated plate to close scrutiny. He also notices the corresponding illustration in plate 84 of Jerusalem and mentions the church in the background. Actually there are two churches: Westminster Abbey and Saint Paul’s Cathedral. The illumination shows London, blind and age bent, led by a child through the streets of, not Babylon, but London, a confirmation of Malmberg’s idea that Blake’s London was Babylon born again.
  
There are good sections on the print Jah and His Two Sons Satan and Adam and on Blake, sex, and homoeroticism, called “A Woman Scaly and a Man all Hairy,” and a very interesting one on “Feet.” I noticed long ago that Blake drew feet carefully, and in many special, sometimes idiosyncratic ways, but I noticed the fact without realizing its importance. Other Blake readers/beholders may have had a similar experience. Malmberg has helped us understand the significance of feet in Blake, or would have, if all Blake enthusiasts could read Swedish. The book would be well worth translating into English.
  
The last chapter deals with Jerusalem, in Malmberg’s mind Blake’s greatest work and the cause of his Blake experience in a hotel in New York in November 1993. He had bought the Blake Trust facsimile of copy E of Jerusalem and went to bed with it. The text was printed in a delicate brick red, the pages adorned with watercolor and gilding, Blake was opened to him and he realized that he held in his hand the most beautiful book in the world. The facsimile is almost as good as the original, with one exception: there is no flash of metal in the gold.
  
There are a few blemishes, and some of them have nothing directly to do with Blake. Malmberg seems to be under the impression that there existed, in the Renaissance, an artist with the family name of da Vinci. That vulgarity is understandable in a thriller writer such as Dan Brown, but a well-known and cultured essayist and art historian like Malmberg should know better. Leonardo was born out of wedlock; he had no family name and no father’s name. The normalized Italian form Leonardo would be acceptable, but to himself and to his first biographer, Giorgio Vasari, he was Lionardo. The woodcut of his portrait in Vasari’s Lives of the Artists is captioned “LIONARDO DA VINCI PITT. E SCVLTOR FIOR.” Because the artist was born in the Tuscan village of Vinci he was called Lionardo da Vinci to distinguish him from other Lionardos, but that does not make da Vinci his family name or surname. That there is a family with the name da Vinci today is a different matter entirely. In fifteenth-century Italy most people spent their lives, like Lionardo, without a family name. In Finland the law that every person should have a family name is as late as the early twentieth century.
  
Malmberg’s term “färgetsning” for the large color print of Newton is misleading. The technique is not precisely known, but the print has nothing to do with “etsning” (etching); it should be called “färgtryck.” The color-printed illuminated books, done from etched copperplates, can of course be named etchings, but the large color prints have clearly been printed from something else, presumably millboard or cardboard.
  
The strange brooding figure on plate 78 of Jerusalem is unlikely to be an eagle-headed man. On his head is a fleshy crest, like that of a cock, and a humanized cock he is, soon to herald the rising sun at the beginning of the last chapter of the poem, which ends with a renewal of everything at the last judgment. In addition, I have doubts about the giant on plate 62. There is a tendency among Blake scholars to identify and name every figure, whether it makes sense or not. In his Illuminated Blake Erdman goes to extremes in this direction. Malmberg is mostly careful, but his tentative identification of the giant with its feet aflame as Jesus is farfetched, to say the least. Why not agree that some of Blake’s figures cannot be identified, since we have nothing to go on? Some questions will always remain questions.

“The Daughters Weave their Work in loud cries”: Blake, Slavery, and Cotton

At the height of abolitionist outrage,All quotations from Blake are from The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, ed. Erdman. I thank Morris Eaves, Morton Paley, the anonymous third reader, and Sarah Jones for their comments and suggestions. William Blake used the signifier slavery to denote more than a catastrophe of African slave torture: a hemispheric system of plantation and textile workers. His comparison of “black” chimney sweeps to African slaves will be more familiar to readers, and anticipates his strategies to reframe slavery to include child labor in mills. In “The Chimney Sweeper” from Songs of Innocence (1789), the boy speaker says, “my father sold me” (line 2). This is no twist on the imagery of African slavery; orphans and pauper children were sometimes sold by guardians into dire apprenticeships of perennial terms. The speaker tells of a fellow sweep, Tom, who has an anxious dream of deliverance from the misery: And the Angel told Tom if he’d be a good boy, He’d have God for his father and never want joy. And so Tom awoke and we rose in the dark And got with our bags and our brushes to work. Tho’ the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm, So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm. (“The Chimney Sweeper” 19-24) Salvational teaching enforces cheap labor in London (as on benevolent plantations abroad): Tom has absorbed homilies about duty, work, and obedience, of which the last line is an example. The phrase “we rose in the dark” is a bitter echo of the resurrection that the angel promises (and delivers for the dead sweeps in Tom’s dream), that otherworldly reunion of boy with Father.
 
In Blake’s expression, the young worker’s nightmare disturbs the great organizing principle of Christian abolitionism: slave martyrdom. “That thousands of sweepers Dick, Joe, Ned and Jack / Were all of them lock’d up in coffins of black” (lines 11-12) imagines small bodies—really a subpopulation—consumed by hard and poisonous work. These de facto slaves do not allegorically rise from the horrors of a slave ship, which this crowded image refracts, nor from the persecution of chains, whips, and hangings, to judge and damn their abusers. Their African counterparts in scenes of popular abolitionism suggest martyrs—such as the kneeling supplicant in Wedgwood’s famous medallion—imitating Christ in their torture, but soot-blackened sweeps are victims of work.For a study that shows the prevalence and power of Christian martyr imagery and its obscuring of labor in the discourse of popular abolitionism, see Moyer. Hence, their fantastical resurrection frees them from a life doomed to labor.
 
In subsequent works, Blake develops a post-abolitionist critique of intertwined economies of forced labor, of New and Old World sites; he frames such works to link conditions of colonial and metropolitan slaves. That such slaves are part of a system is Blake’s point. To say that “slave” covers a type of British worker is not, for Blake, simply to compare white misery with black. Such comparisons were not unheard of coming from labor advocates, who resented sympathy for distant “Negroes,” and from pro-slavery lobbyists, who cynically cited England’s squalor to say that Negroes had it pretty good.For an overview of efforts to juxtapose slavery with harsh conditions of labor (which intensified during the British debates on the slave trade), see, for example, Tise (95-96). Blake critically saw African slaves and some British workers as enmeshed in the Atlantic economy’s division of labor.
 
By contrast, British anti-slavery had the paradoxical tendency of supporting the social order, as David Brion Davis explains: “Abolitionists could contemplate a revolutionary change in status precisely because they were not considering the upward mobility of workers, but rather the rise of distant Negroes to the level of humanity” (467). To advocate the “upward mobility of workers” in the 1790s, while France experimented with upending its social order, was to risk the mark of Jacobinism and repressive crackdowns by the monarchy. Pre-revolutionary abolitionism in Britain was already inclined to focus on the seemingly unique horrors of African slavery and to separate them from a larger problem of labor exploitation. Thomas Clarkson titled his 1786 treatise An Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species, Particularly the African; note the modifying “Particularly the African,” which admits of multiracial slavery even while underscoring especially sinful treatment of one kind of slave. Eric Williams sums up the reality that Blake contemplates and begins in a repressive time to articulate: “Unfree labor in the New World was brown, white, black, and yellow; Catholic, Protestant and pagan” (7). Blake’s frequent “weaving” image of entrapment is elaborated out of his sense of conditions across, especially, the hemispheric textile industry, which requires plantation and mill.Paley (“The Figure of the Garment”) and Hilton have studied Blake’s weaving imagery. Paley nicely observes a distinction between Blake’s symbols of weaving—the web and the net—and the garment. The former convey “only negative implications … of entrapment,” while the latter is “ambiguous”—a symbol of mediation between redemption and imprisonment (126-27). Hilton sees Blake’s invocations of “fibre” as suggestive of a diseased organism, symbolic perhaps of imperialistic economic relations (96). He comments sharply on the association of women and spinning, and “their depersonalization into engines” (277). He insists, though often obscurely, upon a solidarity between African and English slaves that would further radicalize anti-slavery.
 
Commentators have noted Blake’s focus on spinning and weaving as images of labor in a new industrial situation, yet the persistence with which he compares female and child workers with African slaves—his critique of systemic slavery in cotton—also deserves careful treatment. For instance, Visions of the Daughters of Albion (1793) is the first of Blake’s attempts at an analysis, one sensitive to female vulnerability to labor exploitation.Erdman briefly suggests an interpretation of the daughters’ slave identity, and hence the poem’s indictment of English factory labor (“Blake’s Vision of Slavery” 243). Makdisi also follows this line of thought: “What is happening here, then, is not that the harlots or the spinning daughters—the spinsters—of England are being compared with slaves in America … but rather the reverse” (93). Discussing later works, Paley suggests why, in Jerusalem, Blake links Manchester and Liverpool—“the former because of its new urban squalor and human dislocation, the latter because of its role as the principal port of the slave-trade” (The Continuing City 198). This considerably predates the works (for example, The Four Zoas, Jerusalem) in which critics see his deepest commentaries on industrialization, if not on a system with colonial slavery. Reading Visions in the context of the cotton industry helps reveal Blake’s critique of multi-site slavery and of conventional abolitionism, as does reading afresh the later works.
 
Note first that both Visions and America a Prophecy (also 1793) seem demonstrations of the same comparative mapping or “spanning” device. Visions and America are bridge-like. In both poems, England (“Albion”) and America stand facing each other; the Atlantic Ocean represents a transformative medium between these sites of slavery. The Atlantic’s symbolic power to unify arises from its literal status as a hemispheric trade route. Moreover, the protagonists and “prophetic” action of both poems traverse the ocean to introduce or connect mirroring slaves. (Blake’s seers generally, not just Oothoon and Orc, are frequent flyers who relate human conditions from above.) The recurring figure of Visions, like an ostinato in music, is one of desperate communion across the expanse: “The Daughters of Albion hear her woes, and eccho back her sighs” (2.20, 5.2, 8.13). Both poems feature a multi-dimensional hero who suggests an African-American and an English slave, fusing or refracting them in a composite persona. Near the peak of publicity of the slave trade and efforts to end it, Blake twice refuses to treat slavery in terms of African servitude only; he uses the moment to reframe the term around labor in an industrial empire.
 
In Visions and America this mapping of multi-site slavery remains somewhat opaque, but in The Four Zoas (c. 1796-1807) Blake expresses it clearly: First Trades and Commerce ships and armed vessels he builded laborious To swim the deep and on the Land children are sold to trades Of dire necessity still laboring day and night till all Their life extinct they took the spectre form in dark despair And slaves in myriads in ship loads burden the hoarse sounding deep Rattling with clanking chains the Universal Empire groans. (The Four Zoas [95].25-30) The breathless speed of this report reflects the bird’s-eye view: two types of slaves are oblivious to the commercial system that herds and works them. Blake’s punning repetitions join sites of the hemisphere’s most constrained workers. “Trades” and “trades” link Britain’s global interests (including the slave trade) with local (for example, textile) trades into which children “are sold.” The echoing pairs “ships” and “deep” and “ship loads” and “deep” also associate Britain’s commerce with the gruesome trade in human cargo. This concatenation of words and sounds performs textually what it exposes ideologically: the “clanking chains” of two kinds of slaves upon which the empire depends. Blake’s phrasing in the last two lines exploits the ambiguity of enjambment to make it sound as if “slaves in myriads in ship loads” are the ones “Rattling” their chains, whereas the “Universal Empire” itself turns out (also) to be rattling and groaning. The result suspends grammar, compressing “slaves” and “Empire” into a distressed entity. “Universal Empire” (mock inflated, in Blake’s capitals) represents the mass of people at labor. “Empire groans” performs no simple personification; it is a metonym that demystifies, by the sounds of people at toil or in chains, the imperial veneer.
 
The passage is noteworthy for plotting a new kind of imperial dominance: 1) securing materials and markets abroad; 2) industrializing the metropole; 3) accelerating the slave trade to meet industrial demand. The commercial and enforcement ships are “builded laborious,” a reminder of anonymous labor; their builder, “he,” “Urizen,” personifies technocratic ownership. In a Blakean inversion of figures, ships “swim the deep” while humans become lifeless; the ocean and its “deep” in Blake allude at times to the slave trade.  On “free” English soil, laborers must, because of hunger and inadequate wages (“dire necessity”), work nonstop in mills that induce, then supply, new markets. Characteristically, Blake suggests that mill workers are susceptible to jejune religious instruction; he figures the child workers in the form of specters, not only because they are thin, but also because their grim lives seek consolation (“they took the spectre form in … despair” [italics mine]). In Blake’s witness, an accelerating trade in slaves is now the consequence of factory demand for raw materials (“And slaves in myriads in ship loads” [italics mine]). Breathless “stories” such as this set Blakean voices against imperial myth: the speaker perceives, and deconstructs, a terrible complex.For a different analysis of Blake’s storytelling as deconstructive—as undoing or “consuming” its own narrativity through temporal instability—see Cooper.
 
Blake’s personification of a groaning empire animates a similarly clear-eyed (and open-eared) figure later in the same poem, again to bridge African and English laborers. An angry “Demon of the Waters,” a personification of English history, recounts his wounds, factory and plantation slavery chief among them: And what I loved best was divided among my Enemies My little daughters were made captives and I saw them beaten With whips along the sultry sands. I heard those whom I lovd Crying in secret tents at night and in the morn compelld To labour and behold my heart sunk down beneath In sighs and sobbings all dividing till I was divided In twain …. (The Four Zoas 89 [97].5-11) Here Blake employs a different figure to effect his mapping of slavery: a diseased and divided English heart recalls that the empire’s scattered slaves once belonged to the same family. The demon’s beloved “daughters” (in The Four Zoas the term often suggests young women of the textile trades) now stand for captives in cotton mills (“secret tents”) and slaves in the tropics (“sultry sands”). Their recent slave histories bear the traces of a shared filial origin, really a common imperial source of cruelty and exploitation. As with “groans” (The Four Zoas [95].30), the figure of hearing people’s pain at labor is Blake’s signature way of marking such toil and its social invisibility. Note that the children cry not at laboring, but in the nightly interstice—a picture of their oblivion and their awareness of it. The end-line markers “beaten” and “compelld” subtly distinguish two kinds of slaves in cotton—those facing the brutal enforcements of the plantation, and those the coercions of the mill system. The demon can see (“I saw”) the scandalous violence (“whips”) of African slavery, while, paradoxically, those closer to home must be heard because they lack attention from abolitionist campaigns. But “little daughters” functions as an equating and humanizing signifier, naming African slaves and English paupers and orphans.
 
Unheard voices of toil link slaves and child workers in this analogous, earlier passage from Visions: At entrance Theotormon sits wearing the threshold hard With secret tears; beneath him sound like waves on a desart shore The voice of slaves beneath the sun, and children bought with money. That shiver in religious caves beneath the burning fires Of lust …. (Visions 2.6-10) This prototypical example places African slaves and child workers in conceptual proximity. But as befits the bleak and desperate Visions, no moment of liberating recognition overcomes a spiritually enlightened wanderer, as happens at a similar moment in Jerusalem (20.12-18). Blake’s repressed, sanctimonious, and craven Theotormon is a satiric stand-in for some Britons, complicit in domestic textile enslavement, reluctant to take a stand on the African slave trade and plantation slavery.In “Blake’s Vision of Slavery,” Erdman relates Theotormon to Wilberforce and to the Abolition Society as a whole: the latter, inoculating itself from the taint of radicalism, stated in February 1792 that it did not seek “the Emancipation of the Negroes in the British Colonies” but only an end to “the trade for Slaves” (246) (quotations and italics are from Erdman). Erdman does not say that the incremental approach was a necessity, and a radical step. Blake is on the alert for backsliding, for the rationalizing to which such incremental politics are susceptible. (His tears of self-pity and guilt abrade a stone threshold, an image of paralyzed inaction.) As in Blake’s work generally, the voices of slaves and children have no social status: they sound like “waves on a desart shore,” incessant, loud, and desolate. As in The Four Zoas, African slaves and English children are of one voice—there groaning, here waves breaking. In The Four Zoas, shiploads of slaves “burden the hoarse sounding deep,” as if even the ocean could never absorb the crime’s enormity; similarly, in Visions, the Atlantic’s roar transmits the immeasurable pain of slaves and children across the same sea. For Blake, the Atlantic’s waves cannot break on any shore without calling to mind both plantation slaves and their counterparts, caught in the same commercial nexus.
 
The Daughters of Albion in the Cotton Nexus
 
 
1. Visions of the Daughters of Albion copy I, pl. 1 (Erdman numbering). Yale Center for British Art, Paul Mellon Collection. B1978.43.1582.

 
The opening line of Visions proclaims in magnified letters that the “Daughters of Albion” are “Enslav’d.” “The Eye sees more than the Heart knows,” the poem’s headline and epigraph, is an elliptical way of saying the same thing: we Britons can see what is happening to women and girls, for instance in the textile trades, but we lack the heart to call it what it is. Visions has been read with interest since the 1980s for its provocative handling of gender and sexual politics alongside a dark fable of African-American slavery. Critical discussions of Blake’s views on women and gender attend closely to this poem.For such readings and critiques, see Bruder, Sturrock, and Goslee. Discussions of Blake’s views on African slavery, though scantier, similarly begin with the poem or arrive at it.For such discussions, see Erdman, “Blake’s Vision of Slavery,” as well as Mellor and Bindman. For a recent analysis of Visions that treats both its gender and racial signifiers and argues that they dramatize the ambiguous power of essentializing to denigrate or liberate, see Welch. Some critics read the poem as drawing an analogy between English gender oppression and American chattel slavery, bringing into the open the legal oblivion and violence that eighteenth-century women endured by comparing them with slaves. Others see it as going still further in its gender politics by exposing the way phallic power—male sexual desire and rivalry—plays a role in all kinds of abuse, even white efforts to dominate blacks. The poem allies both readings. It also allies two sites of slavery, America and England: they are slave colony and industrial metropole, a linkage that commiserating workers in cotton can appreciate. The daughters of Albion want to communicate with Oothoon, the African-American slave who stands as their counterpart across the Atlantic, because they share with her a condition of economic, as well as gender, enslavement. This economic critique is one that wartime British interests, using cotton to expand economically (and politically and militarily) cannot well abide—one a wary radical poet will insinuate through symbol and subtext.
 
By force of the tacit equation of the plantation with cotton—the new king displacing sugar since the revolution in textile manufacture—Oothoon is a cotton slave. Her English counterparts, the “Enslav’d” daughters of Albion who “eccho back her sighs,” include female spinners and weavers exhausting their eligibility, if not their lives, in England’s mills. In Visions, even the overt themes of male sexual insecurity and violence and of female sexual liberation are not far afield from the subtext of oppressed labor. Since the spinners’ work consumes their eligible years and sexual lives—and middle-class culture wants them chaste and industrious—their vision of sexual freedom is the more urgent. Though plantation bound, Oothoon is mentally free enough in the spinners’ projection of her to express ideals of love and sexual freedom. To reinforce the notion that these daughters are dreaming the poem, Blake reprints the lone word “Visions” above its opening.
 
While the poem addresses women’s status generally, it contemplates women at the extreme socioeconomic margin. “Daughter” refers partly to a new type of textile worker: paupers as young as six were carted “in wagon-loads” from London workhouses to Lancashire mills by middlemen, or sold by their desperate parents into factories (Inglis 124). Mill owners made it a policy to hire children before adults, and females before males—a practice they colluded to defend in the face of parliamentary inquiries into child labor after 1800 (Inglis 121). In text and image Blake invokes young textile workers throughout his career—for the first time, here in Visions. Oothoon’s summary speech sympathizes with weavers and spinners: “she who burns with youth. and knows no fixed lot” is nevertheless “bound to hold a rod / Over her shrinking shoulders all the day; and all the night / To turn the wheel of false desire …” (5.21, 25-27). Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi (The Early Illuminated Books) note that the image of the rod condenses multiple enslavements: “A yoke for bearing burdens over her ‘shoulders’ … but also the rod or whip of the slave owner or cruel husband” (277, note on 8.25). To these meanings of rod can be added more specifically the picking stick and perhaps beater of the loom apparatus, which a weaver must hold, and most of all the bar of the spinning jenny. This Oothoon appears at times more a phantasm, the daughters’ alter ego as they dream her; she reverts to their problems, which include deforming labor in the spinning mills.
 
“Daughters” of the poem’s title and epistrophes comes into sharper focus in light of its use in subsequent works. The Four Zoas describes “The Daughters of Albion girded around their garments of Needlework / Stripping Jerusalems curtains from mild demons of the hills” (25.25-26)—a startling image of textile mills denuding sheep and displacing local wool economies. This launches a passage suggestive of industrial slavery (25.34-39). Later still, there is this story of England’s origins in divided labor (weaving daughters, hammering sons): Enitharmon wove in tears Singing Songs of Lamentations And pitying comfort as she sighd forth on the wind the spectres And wove them bodies calling them her belovd sons and daughters Employing the daughters in her looms and Los employd the Sons In Golgonoozas Furnaces among the Anvils of time and space Thus forming a Vast family wondrous in beauty and love. (The Four Zoas 103.32-37) The creator-employer’s emoting seems self-indulgent and hypocritical. Her “calling” the workers “belovd” runs without pause into “Employing” them. The bodies are stuck “in,” not merely “at,” the looms. The climactic ending to the first book of Milton has this nightmarish allusion to inventor John Kay’s flying shuttle (1733), which revolutionized cotton weaving by exponentially speeding up the process:For a discussion of Kay’s flying shuttle (which increased demand for yarn and stimulated the search for faster spinning), see de L. Mann. See also Mantoux 206-09. The stamping feet of Zelophehads Daughters are coverd with Human gore Upon the treddles of the Loom, they sing to the winged shuttle. (Milton 29.58-59) Unable in the din (underscored by the consonance of t’s and d’s of “feet,” “treddles,” and “shuttle”) to communicate with each other, they sing to their looms.
 
Similarly, in Blake’s Jerusalem (1804-20), “daughters” habituated to industry tragically serve to spread a dehumanizing imperial economy: The Daughters Weave their Work in loud cries over the Rock Of Horeb! still eyeing Albions Cliffs eagerly siezing and twisting The threads of Vala and Jerusalem running from mountain to mountain Over the whole Earth. (Jerusalem 67.26-29) As with “sing to the winged shuttle” in Milton, the image derives its power from the compression of signifiers of a conflicted psychology, so that the “Daughters” are both eager and desperate, laboring while hopeful. Blake enlivens this proto-Marxian collapse of worker into her commodity, dramatizing the thin line between resistance and fetishization in the verbal contrast between work (“siezing and twisting”) and the reach of the product (“threads … running … Over the whole Earth”). The organizing image—“The Daughters Weave their Work in loud cries”—cuts to workers’ anguish of complicity in their own exploitation, as their going to work reinforces (weaves) such work, such conditions. Their “loud cries” leak their guilt, or compensate for it in ever shriller eagerness in allegiance to England (“Albions Cliffs”).
 
Jerusalem deepens the theme of a spreading industrialism: the Daughters of Albion Weave the Web Of Ages and Generations, folding and unfolding it, like a Veil of Cherubim And sometimes it touches the Earths summits, and sometimes spreads Abroad into the Indefinite Spectre, who is the Rational Power. (Jerusalem 64.2-5) Along with “Rational Power,” of which the technocratic way of organizing human labor is a version, Blake wants to expose the role of religious morality in controlling labor. (The deft “like a Veil of Cherubim” conjures the charm of any soft-twilled product that people like and worship, and that makes it so easy not to see [“Veil”] the labor behind it.) Hence, he creates this image of textile workers subject to shame-inducing ideas for chaste industry: “The Daughters of Albion clothed in garments of needle work / Strip them off from their shoulders and bosoms, they lay aside / Their garments; they sit naked upon the Stone of trial” (Jerusalem 66.17-19). Early in Jerusalem, Blake frames the new conditions of industrial labor in terms of a British “family”: “Scotland pours out his Sons to labour at the Furnaces / Wales gives his Daughters to the Looms” (16.22-23).
 
The prevalence of girls and women in the mechanized textile factories was impressive, as records in the industrial phase demonstrate (though records before 1800 are spotty). Among a major group of Lancashire cotton mills around 1830, girls and women made up over half of the work force of 7600. “Young women” and girls (those twenty-one and under) composed one third of the total. Women and children of both sexes made up 79 percent of the work force; adult males composed less than a quarter (Inglis 303). Parliamentary returns of 1816 indicate that 17.7 percent of the work force in the cotton industry were adult males (Pollard, “Factory Discipline” 103). In 1789 at Richard Arkwright’s mammoth Cromford mills, there were only 150 men out of 1150 workers—13 percent of the total (May 72-73). (The starting ages for children in the cotton industry were low enough, at nine or ten years; in the silk industry, which employed them almost exclusively, children started at six or seven years [Pollard, “Factory Discipline” 103].) As one historian glosses females’ predicament of low wages and dismal working conditions: “It could in fact be argued that in the process of proletarianisation, women were often proletarianised first, increasing their vulnerability and their dependence on men” (Hudson 23).For more on women’s importance to the textile industry, see Bythell. For a literary-critical perspective on women’s association with textile production, especially in the proto-industrial context, see Callaghan.
 
Blake’s attention to young female textile workers and to their conditions both materially and sexually makes sense then as part of an alarmed response to a changing England. Blake spent his childhood in his family’s hosiery shop at 28 Broad Street; he knew the traditional textile business.Bentley notes that Blake’s father and brother ran the shop from 1752 to 1812 (12-15, pl. 7). In his pioneering chapter on Blake and weaving, Hilton also mentions Blake’s family background (107). He was alert to the industry’s transformation, which happened in the two decades between his youth and adulthood. “Transformation” does not convey the impact of the revolution in textile manufacture, which was primarily a British phenomenon, penetrating and altering most aspects of British life and culture, and a key reason for Britain’s long dominance in both textiles and industry generally. So swift was the transition to mass production, so large were the profits accumulated by owners of textile mills, and so purely exploitative were the terms of employment that economic historians debate the usefulness of cotton as a representative case for generalizing about the early phases of Britain’s industrial revolution.For a discussion of this debate, see McCloskey 243-48. Blake’s commercial work brought him (probably inevitably, given the reach and size of the cotton industry) into the domain of a textile producer, Moore and Co., which hired him c. 1797 to engrave its advertisement (see illus. 2). Taking or needing this work was probably humiliating to Blake; it may account for some of the bitterness he hurls at the textile industry. The image deserves closer reading; to interpret it helps us situate Blake within imperial capitalist discourse, and helps us see the extent of his critique of industrial practices.
 
 
2. An advertisement (c. 1797) by William Blake for Moore and Co. manufactory (see enlargement). Belying the grim conditions of women and children in textile mills—against which Blake the poet rails—the engraving is a sumptuous idealization, replete with symbols of national greatness and vignettes of happy industry. The Latin epigraph speaks of “the British quill succeeding now the needle of Babylon.” © Trustees of the British Museum. 1868,0711.439.

 
The advertisement depicts a tripartite temple of British textile greatness. Following the compositional rule of thirds, the image is vertically ordered from a pedestal of “revealed” and “realistic” factory production to an intermediate proscenium of eager child labor to a symbolic pediment of British imperial strength. Between two great columns Moore and Co. makes an elaborately etched sales pitch touting its carpets and hosiery. The scene is one of happy industry. Two adult male workers—one a handloom weaver, the other at a knitting machine—flank the image at the bottom, as if anchoring imperial pillars. Of the nine workers, at least four are children; three others—the male apprentice to the weaver’s right, and the two nearly synchronized women weaving a carpet—appear to be in their teens. Above ground, as it were, as if to represent and normalize the industry below, three well-fed, handsomely dressed children go to their tasks. Two small boys attend to huge carpets; a girl sits at a training-sized spinning wheel. Sumptuous carpets cloak the twin columns, rising with them to support an imperial nimbus, where carpets, steam clouds, royal devices, and rays of the sun combine in a herald of industrial and geopolitical might. The insignia of the Prince of Wales (with his Orwellian motto, the ancestral German “Ich Dien”—“I Serve”) hover left and right, and the royal arms topmost. The carpets wrap the structure, subsuming the busy labor under glory.
 
Appeals to class-conscious consumption pervade the copy: Private Families may be supplied with Silk, Cotton, Worsted, and Thread Stockings of all kinds and qualities, on the most reasonable terms. Colours and patterns of Carpeting may be changed to suit the taste of the Purchaser, and patterns of Hosiery made to any size. In the foreground are the proprietor and a lady client taking in the industry. (They are the only figures communicating with each other, a mini-drama that also serves to fix the eye, while their pointing initiates a succession of focuses counterclockwise through scenes of work, then upward to empire.)  The image encourages the viewer to identify with the purchaser. Words and image both are pitched to women of means; “stockings” stokes a desire for visible luxury. Meanwhile, the two female bodies send a comforting message about their work and about disciplined conduct for women of a certain class. (Twinned women reinforce the class/group subtext in a way a single figure would not.)
 
This advertisement is a revealing matrix. First, child and female labor in the mills was a common practice, and common knowledge; the advertisement trumpets what nationalistic discourse always claimed—that children and women were properly and happily enrolled in the industry. The engraving produces a rather strained argument for their labor in a percolating debate over the same, in which Blake’s dissenting commentaries are the angriest (if also obscure). The two almost mechanically synchronized women (the heart of the picture), ironically focused by the pointing owner and leisurely client, counter anxiety regarding female labor in the textile mills (not quite synchronized says “still free”). Anxiety on the religious right is concerned with women’s conduct in the mills, their sexual vulnerability and comportment; anxiety on the left is concerned with their working conditions. This parlor or drawing room is designed to ease both. The two rugged young males assisting the handloom weaver—himself a symbolic denial of dislocations in formerly male-dominated, craft-conscious weaving—represent legitimate apprenticeship. Parliament would soon address, if ceremoniously, a crisis in textile apprenticing, which saw boys (and perhaps some girls) bonded into sham agreements, with no real hope of learning a profession that they could ply independently.On such apprentices, see Inglis 104: “In the factories they were employed in their own right, as machine-minders, learning no trade—being effectively prevented from learning one ….” On the debate surrounding the Health and Morals of Apprentices Act of 1802, see Inglis 78-80, 121.
 
Later, in Jerusalem, Blake writes the dark parody of this iconography in its demystified reverse image: And one Daughter of Los sat at the fiery Reel and another Sat at the shining Loom with her Sisters attending round Terrible their distress and their sorrow cannot be utterd And another Daughter of Los sat at the Spinning Wheel Endless their labour, with bitter food. void of sleep, Tho hungry they labour: they rouze themselves anxious Hour after hour labouring at the whirling Wheel Many Wheels and as many lovely Daughters sit weeping. (Jerusalem 59.26-33) What stands out here is the concern for a vulnerable group of English females whose situation, for almost a half century starting in the 1780s, is so marginal that it “cannot be utterd.” The Moore advertisement’s imperial display, typical of the discourse of national interest during the 1790s, suggests the bravery required to “utter” on behalf of these women; Blake’s complicit engraving is a most personal instance of non-utterance. Of Blake’s concern for female textile workers, which is detailed through his non-commercial work, there is no parallel in literature of the period. “And one Daughter … and another … And another Daughter … and as many lovely Daughters sit weeping” typifies Blake’s anaphoric insistence on activating hearing, on making the socially invisible audible through alliterative names and signifiers (“Wheels … weeping”). Moreover, the passage is accurate. “Endless their labour, with bitter food. void of sleep, / Tho hungry they labour” reads like a prescient transcription of real children’s oral testimony on the long shifts and difficulty in taking meals while at the machines. To cite three examples: I have worked till twelve at night last summer. We began at six in the morning [an eighteen-hour shift]. I told the book keeper I did not like to work so late, and he said I must. We only get a penny an hour for overtime. The engine never stopping excepting about ten minutes to be oiled …. Never stop to take our meals except at dinner; has gone on so this six years and more ….These quotations are from the minutes of MP Michael Sadler’s 1832 commission on child labor, quoted by Inglis 306-07. “They rouze themselves anxious / Hour after hour labouring” reveals a child psychology of profound intimidation, the human animal in its residual recoil from miserable conditions. The machines are grimly mesmerizing: “fiery Reel,” “shining Loom,” “Spinning Wheel,” “whirling Wheel.” Monstrous toys, they dwarf young minds and proliferate to defeat them one by one: “Hour after hour labouring at the whirling Wheel / Many Wheels and as many lovely Daughters sit weeping.”
 
Blake targets this strange way of arranging human beings: industrialization, the operation of machines in round-the-clock mills.The literature on the transformation of labor—from independent to wage labor—during the industrial revolution is considerable. See, for example, Hill 214-15 and Hobsbawm 48-51. For an overview of the modern factory system as distinct from older systems of manufacture, see Mantoux 25-44. See also Pollard, “Factory Discipline,” on the rise of disciplinary techniques to enforce the new form of labor, and May (64) on the distinction between “standard of living” and “way of life,” and the profound changes to the latter. Parliament’s Combination Acts of 1799 and 1800 established that there would be no state interference in the labor market, only official acquiescence to the trends Blake observes (Inglis 82). Blake’s critique targets not just machine technology, but also the coercive techniques that enable its deployment: a combination of machines, labor management techniques, and ideology called the factory. The advertisement that Blake engraves for Moore is an almost parodically optimistic display of this system, while his critique of it in Jerusalem aims to expose it piece by piece—and perhaps to resist his own capture by the cotton nexus. If the advertisement reinforces class and gender roles in the textile industry, and in Britain at large, Jerusalem forms the critique: Other Daughters Weave on the Cushion and Pillow, Network fine That Rahab and Tirzah may exist and live and breathe and love Ah, that it could be as the Daughters of Beulah wish! (Jerusalem 59.42-44) The labor of some English daughters (here, those who do “fine” work—that is, finishers) supports the leisure and luxury of other women, a fact Moore’s advertisement does not so much deny as try to naturalize through images of contented labor and national greatness.
 
The passage shows different classes of spinners laboring to satisfy other English classes, a satire of national harmony. Blake’s ambiguous and suggestive “Weave on the Cushion” brings out the theme of sexual depletion: the textile workers neither sleep nor love, but weave “on” the amorous cushions and pillows they produce, which other women have for their bedchambers. A diction of casual excess—“may exist and live and breathe and love”—conveys leisure’s dependence on the labor of others, and so freedom from necessity. “Breathe” and “love” connote physical passion while expanding the general sense, in contrast to the alienated daughters, of life at its freest. The lines convey women’s alienation from the fruits of their labor and from their bodies, given over and sublimated to the pleasure of others. More darkly, this sublimation turns out to be the daughters’ reason for existing; others’ leisure and love is the daughters’ compensatory devotion, and their pleasure is believing that they bring it about: “Ah, that it could be as the Daughters of Beulah wish!” The sarcastic shift from Albion to Beulah (the idyllic land at life’s end in Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress) layers the psychology of fruitless labor with nationalist and Christian myths of purpose.
 
While the daughters of Jerusalem “sit weeping” at the machines, Blake cares to explain how self-regulated their mental framework is: Yet the intoxicating delight that they take in their work Obliterates every other evil; none pities their tears Yet they regard not pity and they expect no one to pity For they labour for life and love, regardless of any one But the poor Spectres that they work for, always incessantly …. (Jerusalem 59.34-38) The daughters work for “Spectres”—that is, big, hollow ideas (like “Ich Dien”), phantasms that bear little relation to their well-being. Similarly, the “Spectres” are “poor,” not only empty in meaning but also materially impoverishing, no matter how hard the daughters work “for” them. The word “intoxicating” stresses what is unnatural and wildly overcompensating about the daughters’ self-sacrifice and desire for such labor.
 
The choice of “intoxicating” in Jerusalem echoes “to turn the wheel of false desire” in Visions. Both point to the theme of fruitless desire and sexual depletion; Blake sees harnessing women’s libidos as the main psychological method of subjugating female labor in factories. Reforming female desire for purposes of work is a policy Blake critiques time and again, starting with Visions at the height of the abolition debates. One way people can be made to work as hard and fast as the girls do at wheels and looms, suggests Blake, is for their libidinous energy to go into work—for them to sacrifice their shameful sexuality for productivity. Blake dwells on the “daughters” with regard to this theme of sexual sacrifice and sublimated desire because he sees girls and women as particularly susceptible to a moral lesson of chaste industry. Similarly, the plight of factory women, whatever their attitudes at work, becomes easier to rationalize within a culture-wide discourse that construes their labor as good for them morally.
 
A story of sexual freedom and constraint fills up the daughters’ visions, not because Visions is about only sexual politics (and not labor), but because “the pleasures of this free born joy” (Visions 7.2), denied to England’s spinning women, are at stake. Blake the sexual liberationist provokes divergent responses: some critics praise his willingness to affirm women’s sexuality in shame-free terms; others warn that he inscribes a fantasy of free love geared to men’s pleasure and insensitive to the risks to women (such as pregnancy); others read his figures as self-reflexively, if ambiguously, testing notions of sexual agency.Wolfson succinctly summarizes these critical responses, contextualizing them historically and giving each its due (especially the last), in her reading. Alongside these responses, all legitimate, there is another point: Blake stresses that England’s poor females are subject not to ideology about sex all by itself, but also to ideology about work; the two are inextricable and mutually reinforcing.McClenahan observes this linkage (145). She also observes, interestingly, “a contrast” in Blake between some of his images of women’s work and “real-world occupations”—a contrast Blake uses “to honour the labour of women by suggesting its difficulty while representing it as sublimely significant” (137). In most references to spinners and weavers, Blake interrelates work and sexual imagery. Readers sometimes misconstrue the references to labor as idiosyncratic metaphors for women’s psychosexual repression. But Blake mixes material and sexual imagery to argue that a disciplined workplace and disciplined desire go hand in hand to keep female workers at task. David Punter makes the same point, in more general terms: Readings of the Prophetic Books which … see labor as a metaphor for psychological and cosmic conflict have tended to compound the rationalist world-view against which Blake so bitterly protests; and … such readings cannot take account of the principle of the paramountcy of energy, of that energy which pertains not to the mind but to the body. (553-54) The constraining discourse of work parallels that of benevolent Christian slavery, which claims that Negroes similarly attain civilization through the regimens of plantation life. Visions recognizes the parallel with a suggestion of Oothoon’s rape by Bromion, a corrective to the myth of benevolent masters and an image of male domination of (free-spirited) female sexuality in a context of forced labor.
 
To clinch the point that Blake sees sexual constraint as a deprivation of factory toil and as a woman’s way of sublimating such toil, consider this memorable instance of mixing material and sexual imagery in The Four Zoas: The Daughters of Enitharmon weave the ovarium and the integument In soft silk drawn from their own bowels in lascivious delight With songs of sweetest cadence to the turning spindle and reel Lulling the weeping spectres of the dead. (The Four Zoas 113.9-12) Nelson Hilton glosses this caricature as “perpetrating the whole system of generation” (113), akin to the “vegetative” in Blake’s metaphysics—that is, prolific but spiritually dead. This graphic metaphor is also a figure of sexual constraint because of endless work. The ovarium is the uterus, the integument the hymen; by spending year after year “turning spindle and reel,” young women “weave” their sex organs shut, in Blake’s remarkable image of lost sexual lives. “Bowels” and “lascivious delight” mean that the daughters’—that is, spinsters’—devotion to their labor must finally be libidinous. Keeping them devoted to work must mean turning their libidos against themselves, must require a sustaining desire equal to, indeed converted from, sexual need.
 
Blake’s critique is keyed to the anxiety of the consumer public, especially conservative Christians, about the factory as a new and morally treacherous space for women.This is an issue requiring more study. For instance, how connected is on-site religious schooling in the factory villages to the more general discourse of “morality” for women? For a discussion of the disciplinary role of Sunday schools and “evening” schools in the factory village, see Pollard, “The Factory Village” 123: “Sunday schools had a far more important part to play [than day and evening schools], being largely designed to inculcate current middle-class morals and obedience ….” Note that Sunday was the one day off for workers; hence, their leisure time was appropriated and managed to the extent that the Sunday school movement succeeded. He targets the “conduct” discourse that calls for chaste industry on the part of poor women.Sturrock essentially supports this point, albeit in language that obscures the material facts motivating Blake’s critique, such as textile factory work: “I argue that Blake’s association of feminine power and chastity with oppression when placed in context should be understood as part of what Jackie Di Salvo calls his ‘assertion of plebeian values against those of middle-class England’—his rejection not just of an ancient and repressive moral code but of a new and revitalized manifestation of this code, which threatens to perpetuate in a new form a divisive and oppressive social structure” (339). “Prior to the 1770s,” writes Helen Bruder, “most advice literature was directed towards providing guidance and information for young men, but in the later decades of the eighteenth century the behaviour of young women became a subject of more pressing concern, and brought into print a large band of markedly directive and moralistic writers” (40). Bruder does not speculate on what caused this “flood of didactic books for ladies.” One cause was the upsurge in women wage-workers, leaving the domestic space behind for the crowded, rootless one of the mill, factory, and weaving village. Women going out into spaces in which their discipline, obedience, and industry were a capitalist imperative and national interest is one concern of the conduct writing.
 
A protective anxiety about the migration of women from the domestic to the worldly sphere inflects the widely read work of conduct writer Hannah More: That bold, independent, enterprising spirit, which is so much admired in boys, should not, when it … discover[s] itself in the other sex, be encouraged, but suppressed. Girls should be taught to give up opinions betimes, and not pertinaciously carry on a dispute, even if they should know themselves to be in the right …. It is of the greatest importance to their happiness, that they should acquire a submissive temper, and a forbearing spirit, for it is a lesson which the world will not fail to make them frequently practise, when they come abroad into it, and they will not practise it the worse for having learnt it sooner. (145-46)Partially quoted by Bruder (42). To “come abroad into” the world means going off to marry or to work. Young women could do one or the other (or stay home); outwork in a mill meant little prospect for working as a wife. While sincere, More’s advice is at odds with Blake’s disparagement of restrictive codes of conduct in a context of factory labor. At every point—Visions, The Four Zoas, Jerusalem—when Blake invokes England’s “daughters” he joins grim manufacture to moral regulation in his view of the plight of women.
 
By the time of Jerusalem, Blake’s depiction of the world of textile labor and conduct conditioning has achieved the compression that comes with practiced bitterness: “That the deep wound of Sin might be clos’d up with the Needle, / And with the Loom: to cover Gwendolen and Ragan with costly Robes / Of Natural Virtue” (Jerusalem 21.13-15). The lines expose several social facts and an elaborate psychosocial process. They indicate that propertied classes use shame to enforce poor women’s “redeeming” work ethic; that women of conspicuous means reap the fruits of others’ anonymous labor; that beautifying such women is supposed to become for poor women a purpose for living; that “Robes” are “costly” because high both in price and human toll; and that “Natural Virtue,” as Blake sneeringly calls the chaste industry expected of poor women, is neither natural (because ideological) nor virtuous (because morally perverse). Blake sees, somewhat unfairly, the work of conservative moralists as enforcing slavery in England.“Unfair” in that Wilberforce and other conservative evangelicals formed in 1796 the Society for Bettering the Condition and Increasing the Comforts of the Poor, which played a role in defending the apprentice reform bill from efforts of owners to block it. However, Wilberforce and other conservatives, including many leaders of Christian abolitionism, attacked trade-unionizing efforts as against the national interest and resisted other domestic reforms. In addition, they tried to inculcate obedience through religion. On this political activity, see Inglis 79-82.
 
Visions is really where Blake begins to work out this critique of conditioned female labor: a story of female sexuality provides an alternative to the spiritual politics of middle-class Christians and of Christian abolitionists (like More). Visions is a fairly direct critique of Christian abolitionism and its focus on African slaves alone, as those magnified letters suggest: “Enslav’d, the Daughters of Albion weep: a trembling lamentation / Upon their mountains; in their valleys. sighs toward America” (1.1-2). These lines waste no time linking England (“Albion”) with America, and linking the laboring women of each. Blake argues that England’s spinners should be heard in any conversation about slavery that abolitionists are rightly provoking. Moreover, the following line figures Oothoon as “the soft soul of America.” Hence, England’s spinning daughters have more in common with African-American slaves than soul-saving abolitionists do, which is why they echo back Oothoon’s lamentations with their sighs and which is why they should be informing British conversation about forced labor and sexual morality. (Blake’s framing terms—“Enslav’d” and “soul”—and their respective sites—Albion and America—invert the imperial view and Christian assumptions: England is home to slavery, while American slaves have “soft”—already good—souls.) Oothoon plucks flowers as she moves from field to field, shirking, we might suppose, plantation work, and doing so in a subversively suggestive form, flowers marking sexual freedom. This vivid blend of sexual autonomy and work avoidance puts her master, Bromion, into a rage. (In what may function as a reminder that this is the English daughters’ self-commiserating vision, Oothoon “turn[s] [her] face” after plucking, and in short-lived bliss mentally flies “over the waves” to where her “whole soul seeks.”)
 
Though gender politics and sexual mores saturate the poem, it shows the brutal facts of New World slavery, as in Bromion’s sexually sadistic reaction to Oothoon’s truancy. He rapes her “on his stormy bed,” then speaks in words parodic of an overlord, with allusions to plantation tortures (and enforcements) of rape, branding, and whipping: behold this harlot here on Bromions bed, And let the jealous dolphins sport around the lovely maid; Thy soft American plains are mine, and mine thy north and south: Stampt with my signet are the swarthy children of the sun: They are obedient, they resist not, they obey the scourge: Their daughters worship terrors and obey the violent. (Visions 1.18-23) This announcement of African-American slavery is rife with rhetorical figures of swaggering dominance (the chiasmus of geographic reach; the sibilant humiliation of branding; the parataxis of others’ submission). The passage grounds the attempt to see slavery systemically without diminishing the brutality faced by black slaves. Note that “daughters” refers here to black female slaves, chiming openly with the “daughters” of England. Blake’s vision repeatedly connects modes of terror and violence, worship and obedience, that compel disparate people to labor in the same system.

Tate Britain’s New Blake Room

During my visits to what is now called Tate Britain over a period of many years, I have encountered the art of William Blake presented in a number of ways.Some of the Tate’s Blake installations over the years are illustrated in Joyce H. Townsend, Robin Hamlyn, and John Anderson, “The Presentation of Blake’s Paintings,” William Blake: The Painter at Work, ed. Joyce H. Townsend (London: Tate Publishing, 2003) 170-74, figs. 139-43. At first, in 1966, I found it on the main floor. I knew that it had previously been displayed in an octagonal room with mosaic floor designs (derived from The Marriage of Heaven and Hell) by Boris Anrep, but that was before my time. Later, a selection of Blake’s works was moved to a downstairs gallery that had been constructed for them. Not everyone was happy with this. “They moved Blake to the basement,” Sir Geoffrey Keynes said. Still later, a striking venue was constructed downstairs: a darkened, air-conditioned room with illuminated display cases. I thought of it as the Aquarium, because the Blakes seemed like tropical fish on display there. That lasted for about ten years. Then Blake was upstairs again until, on 14 May 2013, a new exhibition room was opened. Its location is conceived as part of the overall rehang that Tate Britain has named the “Walk through British Art.”
  
The new Blake room or rooms, as there are two, can be hard to find, but if you enter through the Turner gallery and go to room 17, you’ll see a sign pointing to the staircase that leads to them. Once there, you are in a pleasantly lit space, which from May to October 2013 featured an exhibition on Blake and landscape created by Hayley Flynn, a doctoral candidate at the University of Nottingham. There were, as one would expect, few pure landscapes exhibited here, two in all, one being the unfinished Landscape near Felpham, which was evidently drawn from a boat, as it views Hayley’s Turret House and Felpham’s old mill from the water. The other was the rather puzzling A Garden Path, Eartham (British Museum), which depicts a fairly regular arrangement of young trees. This drawing does not seem to be preparatory to something else, yet does not, remarkably for Blake, generate interest in itself. The major landscapes here were visionary backgrounds for human-centered subjects. Showing a group of Blake’s works with this in mind makes us more aware of how he followed the practice of the Italian Renaissance painters he so admired.
  
Most of Blake’s landscapes are the products of his own imagination, as those in The Descent of Man into the Vale of Death (British Museum) and The Third Temptation (Victoria and Albert Museum). The Dante illustration The Ascent of the Mount of Purgatory was hung beside Turner’s The Schöllenen Gorge from the Devil’s Bridge, which Flynn suggested as a source for it. Turner’s painting dates from 1802, but another version, displaying a similar inverted corkscrew-like ascending path, was exhibited in 1815. Whether Blake was influenced by it, or even saw it, must remain a matter of speculation. Other aspects of landscape were shown in the pastoral idealizations of Virgil and the paysages moralisés of Job.
  
A section termed Blake’s Landscape Legacy began with Blake’s young followers Samuel Palmer, George Richmond, and Edward Calvert, who were so affected by Blake’s sense of visionary landscape. I was especially grateful for the seldom-seen Palmer drawing The Harvest Moon, supplemented by a jotting from an 1824 sketchbook: “Considering Dulwich as the gate into the world of vision one must try behind the hills to bring up a mystic glimmer like that which lights our dreams. And those same hills, (hard task) should give us promise that the country behind them is Paradise.” Two etchings by Graham Sutherland and John Craxton’s richly distorted revision of Palmer, Dreamer in Landscape, continued this tradition. On the whole, the exhibition theme was an interesting one, prompting the viewer to reflect on how necessary background often was to Blake, in contrast, say, to Flaxman, who illustrated the Divine Comedy without any.
 
The main presentation, devised by Martin Myrone, is not intended as a fixed entity; the Tate’s online announcement says, “This room provides a showcase for a changing selection of Blake works from Tate’s collection.” Some of the forty plus pictures on display could hardly have been omitted—The Spiritual Form of Nelson, for example, and Newton—and I will resist the reviewer’s fatal temptation to say what better choices he or she could have made. As Tate Britain counts 392 Blake items in its possession, this would not be hard to do, but in fact the selection is a very representative one, including the early and the late, the commercial and the visionary, and examples of different media. In one respect it may strive too hard to be representative: as the Tate does not own any original illuminated books, three plates from posthumous pulls are on display. As an idea of Blake’s extraordinary combinations of text and image should surely be given, why not borrow a couple of prime examples from the British Museum’s enormous collection? There would be little point in my naming the pictures displayed, as images of all of them are available at http://​www.​tate.​org.​uk/​art/​artworks?ap=1​andwp=1​andwv=grid​andrid=8578.

The particular blue shades chosen for the carpet and walls not only have a soothing effect but also appear to bring out some details in the pictures that I could not remember having noticed before—some of the figures under the right arm of The Spiritual Form of Pitt, for example. I also sensed a finer perception of the textured reticulations of Newton. There is something about the room itself that encourages peaceful contemplation; I heard little conversation there, and that was muted. It will be interesting to see what the next group of works chosen for exhibition will be like.

Blake and the Xenoglots       Strange-Speaking Critics and Scholars of Blake
       
By G. E. Bentley, Jr.
       
This essay is concerned with writing about William Blake in languages other than English. For the purposes of simplicity and charity, let us consider bureau-speak, computer-speak, crit-speak, newspaper-speak, politico-speak, and even advertising-speak as English.
       
Even during William Blake's obscure lifetime, there were articles on him in languages other than English. Some were earnest and important such as Crabb Robinson's German essay in Vaterländisches Museum  (1811) [1] and some not long after his death assumed what may be called journalistic license such as one in French which invents a madhouse and visits Blake in it. [2] 
       
I have trolled through Blake Books [3]  (covering 1780-1975), Blake Books Supplement [4] (covering mostly 1975-94), and the lists in âWilliam Blake and His Circleâ in Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly  (mostly 1994-2004). I have baited my hook with all the languages of Blake criticism and scholarship of which I could thinkâand with a number of languages in which critics might  have written about Blake but do not appear to have done so. The catch is summarized in the table below.
       
Of course many Blake scholars whose native language is not English yet publish at least occasionally in English. These include Maung Ba Han of Burma, Denis Saurat of France, Detlef Dörrbecker of Germany, Bunsho Jugaku and Hikari Sato of Japan, and Gholen Raza Sabri-Tabrizi of Turkey. Notice that no work on Blake in Burmese or Turkish is recorded here.
       
Some journals in non-English countries are in English, such as Aligarh Critical Miscellany  (India), AnaChronist  (Hungary), Dutch Quarterly Review, Essays in French Literature, Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies, Journal of Chinese Linguistics, Journal of English Language and Literature  (Korea), Milton Studies (Korea), and of course these are overlooked here.
       
On the other hand, there are a number of translations of works originally in English into non-English languages, particularly with authors as distinguished or well-known as Northrop Frye, Nikolaus Pevsner, and Kathleen Raine, and these are included here.
       
Some of these languages are dead, such as Latin and Classical Greek, and the works about them included here mostly deal with Blake's use of these languages. The Gaelic, Hebrew, Latin, and Welsh works here are frequently about Blake's use of these languages rather than written in these languages.
       
The plausibility of the figures given here depends upon:         (1) The comprehensiveness of the coverage of Blake in Blake Books, Blake Books Supplement,  and the lists in âWilliam Blake and His Circleâ in Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly  (1994-2004), the foreign-language portions of which, particularly for Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish, were often compiled by generous friends who are far more linguistically dextrous than I am. The coverage of Blake here is certainly extensive but far from complete;         (2) The accuracy of the indices of Blake Books  and Blake Books Supplement  (fair); and          (3) The reliability of computer search mechanisms (uncertain).
       
The greatest gaps in these bibliographies are almost certainly in non-English languages and especially in reviews. For instance, Oe Kenzaburo's great Japanese novel called in English Rouse Up O Young Men of the New Age is likely to have attracted reviews which commented on his heavy dependence upon the works of William Blake, but none is reported in these bibliographies. Many of these books and essays in foreign languages were not seen at all by GEB, and even when I did see them I could only cope, with diminishing reliability, with French, German, Italian, and Spanish.
       
Many of the entries here are the merest journalism, for example notices, puffs, and reviews of the great exhibitions in Hamburg and Frankfurt am Main (1975), Casa di Dante in Abruggio (1983), and Barcelona and Madrid (1996). (There is no review etc. listed here for the wonderful Blake exhibitions in Tokyo [1990].)
       
The representation here of the chief languages of European civilization is perhaps what one should expect: French (267 works), German (254), Italian (155), Spanish (180), and Russian (90), with a sprinkling of Czech (12), Danish (18), Dutch (8), Finnish (7), Greek (14), Norwegian (8), Polish (18), Portuguese (16), and Swedish (16).
       
Beyond Europe, there are some striking absences for major and influential languages spoken by many millions of personsâthere is nothing in Arabic, Bengali, Hindi, Panjabi, Tamil, or Turkish.
       
One might have expected to find more in Chinese; the paucity of Chinese works here is doubtless largely to be accounted for by the political isolation of Chinaâmost of the works here in Chinese originate in Taiwan.
       
The surprises are Korean and Japanese. There are more Blake essays in Korean than in all but the major European languagesâFrench, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanishâbut, oddly, there appears to be no translation of Blake into Korean. Doubtless the publications on Blake in Korean were significantly related to the U.S. presence there for the last half century.
       
Such a simplistic explanation will not do to account for the astonishing volume of publications on Blake in Japan, for the first of these long antedate the U.S. occupation of Japan. The first essay on Blake in Japan appeared in 1894, and the seminal book on Blake in Japanese Blake studies is Soetsu Yanagi's William Blake  in 1914. Japanese represents about 8% of all essays about Blake for 1780-1975 recorded in Blake Books, and 58% of all the recorded xenoglot essays on Blake. For fifty years now, the majority of works on William Blake in languages other than English has been in Japaneseâ64% of the xenoglot works recorded for 1994-2004.
       
When I was an apprentice scholar, I believed that I should read everything which had been published in my field. Of course this was a council of perfection, but so should young scholars be taught. I was moderately successful with works in English, and I struggled gamely with French and German. Fortunately there was scarcely anything then on Blake in Italian and Spanish, at least no whole books about him, and I dipped into what I could find and dismissed them. I did not then know about the works in Russian and Norwegian, not to mention Esperanto and Yiddish.
       
Today the gap between the council of perfection and the practicalities of linguistic knowledge yawns ever wider. Even were the works all available in some great visionary electronic cumulation, who would have the knowledge to read them, not to mention who would have the time? Indeed, how many committees of linguistic prodigies would be needed to cope with works in Chinese, Farsi, Finnish, Latvian, Welsh, and Yiddish? Plainly, at the very least we shall be overlooking a very extensive proportion of what is available about Blake if we cannot read Japanese.
       
The gap between the practicalities of linguistic capacity and the council of perfection is formidable. But at least let us admit that we are all more extensively ignorant than we had thought.

William Blake, S. W. Hayter and Color Printing       By Martin Butlin             
       
 “Opposition is true friendship”[1]       
       
I should be flattered that my article on Blake's color-printing techniques should have provoked an answer from Robert N. Essick and Joseph Viscomi no less than two and a half times as long; even more surprising is the speed at which they must have prepared their answer (Butlin     “Private War,”  and Essick and Viscomi     “Method,”  both in Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly 36.2 [fall 2002]). Unfortunately this has resulted in a number of inaccuracies and distortions that come strangely from those who claim to     “Labour well the minute particulars”  (     “Method”  49). 
       
Above all it is the authors' failure to recognize fundamental differences between Blake's color-printing technique and that of S. W. Hayter that casts doubt on their ability to see beyond their own commitment to the one-pull cause. But before discussing this central issue, there are a number of minor points that need attention. An inevitable but annoying result of the speed with which they prepared their article is the lack of any page references to my own piece; this is compounded by their idiosyncratic approach to quotations and quotation marks. An example is the quotation attributed to me, presumably jokingly, on page 49:     “looks like two pulls to me and my friends”—no doubt they can read Blake's mind as well! A real quotation, but one equally strange in its implications, occurs on page 56 where the authors put quotation marks around my description of Richard Lloyd's position at Christie's; if they really question this they need only look in Christie's sale catalogues. A third case is rather more serious. On page 57, note 10, one reads that     “Butlin states that             'creating precise registration . . . was indeed anything but a mechanical process.'” After a worried period wondering what exactly I was supposed to have meant by this I went looking for it in my article; finally, right towards the end (     “Private War”  48), I discovered the words     “It [the two-pull process] was indeed anything but a mechanical process creating precise registration; rather, it was the reverse of the precision that, it is claimed [by Essick and Viscomi], could have been produced by a one-pull process.”  The authors have managed to reverse what I actually said, making nonsense of it in the process.
       
Our authors also demonstrate some strange uses of the English language. That of the word     “replicas”  (59) is misleading, particularly when the relevant illustrations (fig. 13, 15 and 16) are captioned with the far more accurate description,     “based on Blake's design.”  Worse, on their first page (49) they indulge in a bit of quibbling over the word     “prominent”  and then go on (50) to apologize for failing to mention my review of Viscomi's Blake and the Idea of the Book in which I expressed my reservations on the one-pull process, in     “a paragraph of 206 words.”  I would be more flattered if they had gone on to read my next paragraph; this also deals with Blake's color-printing techniques and totals approximately another 200 words, thus doubling the total to about 400 in a review of 800 words—this proportion seems fairly     “prominent”  to me, particularly as it was the only critical element in my review (Burlington Magazine 137 [1995]: 123).
       
This lack of attention to an opponent's case is also seen in their reaction to my pointing out the inaccuracy of their denial (repeated six times in all!—see     “Private War”  46) that Phillips had found other     “such failures of registration”  in copy E of Songs beyond that in the     “Nurses Song”  (Phillips, Creation of the Songs 103). Far from apologizing, they exclaim     “This is the sort of general comment in which the advocates of the two-pull theory specialize”  (51). They then go on to ask rhetorically,     “Which plates? Where in each plate? What is the evidence supporting this opinion? Where is the     'overwhelming evidence' . . . ” (51). Well, for those who care to read, Phillips listed five examples on the page I referred to, at the end of the long paragraph on page 103 that concludes just before the end of the right-hand column. Even if our authors do not agree with Phillips's conclusions, they really should not deny that he does give these examples. These and similar inaccuracies and distortions may be regarded as trivial, as failures of method rather than substance, but they cast doubt on the authors' scholarly approach as it applies to their own researches, whether into     “minute particulars”  or on more general matters. 
       
To move on to concerns of more substance, much of the authors' new article goes over old ground, restating their arguments on, for instance, the     “Nurses Song”  in copy E of the Songs (50), the 1794 date on Songs of Experience copy T1 (52-55), and even pin holes (60n12)! They fail to appreciate my distinction between color printing to reinforce lines and color printing to produce areas of dense color and texture, and the implications this has for the need for     “precise registration”  in the first case and its relative lack of importance in the second (50, 51, etc.). I would also question their statement (51), apropos Dörrbecker's claim that the full-page illustrations in The Song of Los were color printed     “from almost unetched plates, occasionally in multiple layers of paint . . . ” (Continental Prophecies 310), that this does not imply multiple pulls; surely the mixture of different colors while they were still soluble (!—see their page 61) would produce a murky effect totally unlike the brilliance achieved by Blake. The authors also reverse my views on the direction of Blake's development (61;     “Private War”  48, where I do not even mention the     “small relief etchings” —perhaps I should have done so, but I was only covering the years 1794-96), but it seems futile to go over these points yet again if they are only to be misread or ignored. 
       
What is good about their article is that they have now ventured onto the difficult ground of intaglio printing and the large color prints of     “1795.”  They are still not prepared to address directly the two fundamental questions, firstly the differences in pressure needed for printing in intaglio and in the thick color medium used by Blake, and secondly the respective drying times of ink and Blake's color medium. Instead they refer to experiments by S. W. Hayter, stating rather coyly that     “It may come as a surprise to Butlin, as it did to Essick, that Hayter believed that simultaneous printing in intaglio and surface colors . . . 'will seem so obvious [to the layman] that he will be surprised to hear that it was not carried out successfully long before'”  (60). Essick may well have been surprised (cf. his William Blake, Printmaker 130), but Butlin was suspicious. It is indeed strange that Essick and Viscomi should be so happy to rely on Hayter's example when, as Morris Eaves has remarked, they claim to have demonstrated that the efforts by Hayter, together with Joan Miró and Ruthven Todd, to recreate Blake's color-printing processes were     “dead wrong.”  [2] 
       
A look at Hayter's own description of how he achieved the combination of intaglio printing and color printing in the key work in this development, Cinq personages, 1946, which takes up a whole chapter in his New Ways of Gravure (1949, 155-61; revised edition 1981, 132-35), together with a look at the good color reproduction in the book from which they do quote by Peter Black and Désirée Moorhead (15-16, 23, 168-69) or even better at an original copy of the print, [3] will show how irrelevant the comparison is. Even in reproduction it can be seen that the areas of color in Hayter's print are translucent if not fully transparent (although interestingly they do show some of the reticulation found in Blake's work); this is a result of their having been printed in colored inks rather than in the thick medium used by Blake. Both the visual effect and the textural effect are therefore totally different from that achieved by Blake in his color-printed books. 
       
Hayter's written description makes this clear:     “On the print, color would appear as offset from the plate surface and, over it, would be the intaglio impression in black, appearing slightly in relief above the surface of the paper”  (159/134); this can be compared with the results of Viscomi's own experiments in printing from an intaglio version of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell plate 10, when, although the illustration was printed at the same time as the text,     “The ink did not print though the colors”  (     “Method”  59, fig. 16). Hayter continues:     “Registration with the black [in applying colors] was simplified by the fact that the plate was visible through the [silk] screen while the work was being done”  (160/134). Earlier in his book Hayter states, in a section on     “Simultaneous printing from surface and intaglio”  (chapter 7, 132-33/115), that     “Inks must be used and color deposited on the surface in such a way that it does not mix with the ink already on the plate. Then, as it is clear that an opaque oily ink between intaglio ink and damp paper would prevent its adhering to the print, the film of color on the surface must remain so thin that it is microscopically porous. Also, it is seldom possible to superimpose two [or more] colors . . . so practicable transparency will be confined to a bitten texture in intaglio over a simple surface color in each part. Of course, the surface color being above the intaglio in the plate will appear underneath it in the print”  (132-33/115; cf.     “Method”  54). This would appear to describe a process just about as far as it could be from that attributed to Blake by Essick and Viscomi. 
       
Interestingly, when Hayter's textures did become thicker, as in Poisson rouge of 1957, he forsook the fine lines of intaglio printing and replaced them with a broad line created by a felt pen and spotting resin, producing a relatively thick textured outline rather than the thin line of Blake's intaglio work (Black and Moorhead 16, 222-23, no. 237, illustrated in color). Hayter's line in these later works is in fact closer to the brush-drawn outlines found in some of Blake's large color prints (as demonstrated by Piers Townshend in the course of a talk to the Blake Society in London on 19 November 2002 ). Incidentally, although Hayter says that it took him fourteen years to perfect his new one-pull technique, this is not strictly accurate: his first experiments, with Anthony Gross, did take place in 1932 (Black and Moorhead 15) but he did little further work on this aspect of his technique until the years 1940 to 1946, from Maternity, 1940 (Black and Moorhead 15, 22, 145, no.132, illustrated in color), to the small Centauresse of 1943-44 (Black and Moorehead 15, 22-23, 161, no. 157, illustrated in color) and, the subject of Hayter's main account, Cinq personages of 1946, a print for which Hayter needed no fewer than four assistants. 
       
The authors raise the question of why The Book of Los and The Book of Ahania only exist in one copy each (57). There are plenty of reasons other than technical ones why this should be so. Of the various factors involved, the most important seems to have been a crisis in Blake's output of poetry. Both books, plus The Song of Los, of which the known copies were done in what, following Viscomi, one can call a single edition, are significantly shorter than their predecessors, The  Song of Los covering the two continents Africa and Asia in four pages as compared with America's 16 plates and Europe's 14 plates, while the two other books contain only seven text pages between them, albeit rather more densely filled with writing. No other books were even nominally published until 1804. Instead, Blake began the long unfinished epic Vala or the Four Zoas, commencing this in a finished, copperplate hand suggesting that he was planning a single deluxe manuscript rather than another illuminated book. At the same time the technique of The Song of Los, still relief-etched, though perhaps the most magnificently and richly colored of all Blake's books, seems to have led to technical difficulties (see my “Evolution of Blake's Large Color Prints,” 115-16) that may have suggested the separate issuing of illustrations without text in the small and large Books of Design and the large color prints of     “1795,”  a development set out by me ad nauseam elsewhere. With the best will in the world, The Book of Ahania and The Book of Los cannot be said to further Blake's attempts to integrate text and illustration, and he may well have been worried by the disparity between the sharply defined lines of the text and the broad, relatively undefined forms of most of the illustrations; only the head-piece to chapter 1 in The Book of Los points to a possible solution. As Essick points out in William Blake, Printmaker (149),     “In The Book of Los and The Book of Ahania, both with surface-printed designs but intaglio lettering, the technical gap between word and picture widens. At that point, the text-design synthesis made possible by relief etching broke down completely, and Blake's color printing rapidly developed independent of his work as a poet.”  So why did Blake even experiment with intaglio printing, if not to achieve a possible easing of the admitted difficulties of the two-pull process? 
       
 “To Generalise is to be an Idiot.”  [4] On page 58 I am accused of saying     “if two pulls here, then two pulls in everything leading up to it [the intaglio books].”  The authors go on to stress     “how experimental Blake was as a printer and printmaker,”  but rather spoil their argument by concluding that his     “consistency resides in his continued use of one-pull printing,”  “In this matter . . . Blake was as consistent as Butlin supposes.”  Given the universally accepted double printing in the     “Nurses Song”  from copy E of Songs there is already a built-in inconsistency here, and if     “the exception proves the rule”  it also breaks it—clearly Blake did use two pulls in this particular work, as even Essick and Viscomi allow.
       
I am not convinced by Essick's change of mind which now attributes the spreading beyond the platemark of the printed color on The Book of Los title page to the presence of bevelled edges on the plate (58); the Book of Job plates, which do have bevelled edges, were done as the result of a relatively generous commission, whereas in the Lambeth Books bevelling would have been a luxury. Viscomi himself suggests that the plates for The Book of Los and The Book of Ahania were cut from a single sheet of copper which was only bevelled on the original outer edge ( Idea 287, 414n26, where he states that plate 3 of Ahania “was the recto side of the sheet, for its right side was bevelled, whereas this edge is on the left side in plate 4 and is sharp from being scored and broken” ; he does not mention the sections used for The Book of Los but would, presumably, have pointed out if there were any signs that Blake's treatment was different). 
       
Essick and Viscomi state that Blake's color-printing medium could be revived by being reprinted onto damp paper under pressure (61). This again begs the question of how long Blake's medium took to dry, and the term     “water-based colors”  fails to distinguish between thin watercolor washes, which might well be so revived, and the thick glue- or gum-based medium used by Blake in the color-printed books. (In fact even thin watercolor becomes insoluble in time; Blake's Dante illustrations in the Tate, as well as a number of Turner watercolors, have been carefully washed in recent years, and the discolored paper of certain early Blake watercolors such as the Tate's Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing has also been bleached.) Essick himself wrote in 1980,     “Repainting and printing from a millboard caked with old, dried pigments would be at best a terribly awkward business”  (William Blake, Printmaker 132). But, as Essick also points out, the gum medium in his own copy of Lamech and Two Wives “is about as insoluble in water as animal glues, and like such glues must generally be heated and agitated before it can be used as a fixative for watercolors. Unlike gum arabic, it is most receptive to subsequent applications of watercolors or pen and ink work without disturbing lower layers”  (131). He goes on to say that the paint used in Blake's color-printed works must have required     “a high level of insolubility”  (131). Presumably Essick has changed his mind, but first thoughts are, it would seem, the best. 
       
Our authors' arguments get even more desperate when they suggest that, when some of the 1795 large color prints were reprinted in 1804-05,     “The outline and composition, the latter in thin layers of dried colors on the support after printing, could be returned to years later and the process repeated”  (61); it is hardly likely that Viscomi, despite all his experiments, has been able to leave his thick color medium for a long enough period to see if it would remain insoluble—certainly not for the nine or ten years necessitated for the later pulls of the large color prints. 
       
Essick and Viscomi admit that at least one of the large color prints, God Judging Adam, was printed from a metal plate, and Rebecca Donnan has confirmed this by pointing out that the version in the Philadelphia Museum is embossed on the back from the etched plate. [5] Whether the other prints were done on metal or on millboard is irrelevant to our authors' suggestion that     “The outline of the design was probably drawn . . . in India ink, which would adhere permanently to the support and not transfer to the paper”  (61). Piers Townshend, however, who restored the pull of Satan Exulting over Eve in the Tate, has shown that such outlines, drawn fairly broadly with a brush, were in fact transferred to the final print (lecture of November 2002). By now, particularly if he was using millboard, Blake, like Hayter in his Poisson rouge, did not need to print the outline as a separate process, though God Judging Adam, the one print definitely from a metal plate, does seem to show relief-etched outlines. This seems to be the exception to the rule; even within the series of twelve prints Blake's technique was inconsistent. 
       
Essick and Viscomi make heavy weather over maculatures, stating that they are incompatible with a two-pull process (63). Other things being equal (which admittedly Essick and Viscomi do not accept) there seems no reason why maculatures cannot appear on successive pulls made either on blank paper or on paper already printed with outlines. The edition could be printed either way, and if Tatham could do without damping his paper (52), why not Blake? (Incidentally, Ruthven Todd suggests that     “it may be doubted whether he [Blake] used his paper in the soaked condition common among modern copper-plate printers” ; rather it would be removed     “from its wrappings at least two weeks before starting on the job”  and left     “lying beside the press to absorb the natural dampness of the printing-shop”  [    “Techniques”  (1973 ed.) 30].) 
       
One possible line of research that leads back from the large color prints to the later color-printed books is perhaps worth reviving. Ruthven Todd, in his William Blake the Artist (1971) suggests that some of the full-page illustrations in the 1795 books could have been printed not on a rolling press but merely by lowering a sheet of paper onto the plate and applying a light pressure:     “Any press would not only flatten the colors, but would also spread them messily”  (37). Such a technique could have been used at least for the full-page illustrations in The Song of Los and The Book of Ahania, and perhaps the clearly defined designs on text pages such as plate 6 of Ahania and plate 5 of The Book of Los. The same would apply to the color-printed versions of Albion Rose and The Avengers (Essick, William Blake, Printmaker pl. 66-67, 69, 70). Without the confines of the printing press, registration, not necessarily too precise, would have been easier, as would have been the task of printing from the relatively large area of the large color prints. This would explain the absence of platemarks on all but God Judging Adam. This possibility has been rejected by Viscomi for the illuminated books but not for the separate color prints (Idea 126), but could be a possible development in the process of technical simplification in the cases mentioned above. 
       
There is clearly much work still to be done on Blake's color-printing techniques. Unfortunately the two camps, for one-pull printing and for double-pull printing, seem to have become irretrievably bogged down. Blake, as we have seen, was inconsistent even within such a series as that of the twelve large color prints. More flexibility, and considerably more time, is needed to write a full account of his color-printing techniques in the 1790s. Essick and Viscomi postulate such a book (49), and one is sincerely to be hoped for, but they should give themselves time, months or years rather than days or weeks, to produce the study of which they are surely capable, one worthy of the subject, of William Blake, and of themselves.

Response       Robert N. Essick and Joseph Viscomi       
       
We trust that those interested in Blake's printing methods will read our two articles and recognize that Blake's color prints (with the exception of “Nurses Song” of “Experience” in Songs of Innocence and of Experience  copy E) were pulled through the press only once. We have countered each claim made by Butlin and Phillips in support of their two-pull theories and see no point in rehearsing our arguments, reproducing our pictorial evidence once again, or correcting further assertions or supposed misreadings since none of the material facts evincing single-pull printing has been refuted.

The Jerusalem Marathon       The Abbey at Sutton Courtenay, 6-7 November 2004                  By Susanne Sklar       Queen's College, Oxford
       
In the preface to Jerusalem Blake says he chooses the words in his poem to suit "the mouth of a true orator" (Jerusalem pl. 3).  I think the poem is meant to be heard and seen.  The Blake Society offered to endorse an overnight Jerusalem  reading.  My dissertation supervisor, Professor Christopher  Rowland, agreed to be a "visionary form."  I asked him to read  Jesus. 
       
My friend Barbara Vellacott (reading Vala) arranged that we could give voice to Jerusalem in the library of the 13th century Abbey at Sutton Courtenay  (about 15 miles from Oxford).  Eleven people read in very  comfortable armchairs and several commented upon the mullioned windows  with their stained glass insets, caryatid angels supporting the ample  mantlepiece, the warm fire, the tall bookcases.  Philip Pullman,  reading Albion, contributed good whisky to the event.  Others  brought biscuits, fruit, sparkling water, energy bars, strong coffee and  tea.  We knew this would be physically draining.  We read the  first three chapters of Jerusalem from just before 7 pm and on into the  night.  We divested ourselves of watches when Jerusalem began so  we did not know how much after midnight it was when we walked through  the dark gardens to the guest house.  We seemed to be walking  through the same doorways Los enters in the poem's frontispiece.   Carrying torches, like Los' globe of light, we rose before dawn to begin  chapter four.
       
This  was not a performance.  There was no audience, no illusion of  "aesthetic distance."  No one rehearsed beforehand, though most  participants knew which character they would read.  Jerusalem  has seven main speaking parts (Jesus, Albion, Jerusalem, Vala, Los,  Enitharmon, and the Spectre) as well as many minor roles contained in  its choruses of Sons, Daughters, and Eternals/Cathedrals.  The text  is more than 60% narration and we each became members of that narrative  body, sometimes individually reading paragraphs or phrases, sometimes  reading in unison,  sometimes in counterpoint, especially when Israel gets mapped onto  Britain.  We echoed and whispered and shouted.  Francis  Gilbert, who embodied Eternals, observed that "we operated as One Body"  when we each "passed the baton" of Blake to one another.  Andrew  Vernede, our Los, enjoyed the freedom to interrupt, to flow together;  "we were borne up by voices," said Eleanor Lord, our Enitharmon, "like a  choir."  Philip Pullman (Albion) commented, "the flow of the poem  was clarified and it came to life in Minute Particulars."
       
Occasionally  Blake's words whirled, making more sound than sense.  Several  readers commented on how dissonance and sense work together when the  poem is heard.  Chris Rowland (Jesus) said that "the words pile up,  as in some liturgical event.  Jerusalem is to be  experienced. . . ."   "Such a poem should be read  collectively," said Tony Eaude, who embodied Albion's Sons.  Tim  Heath (the Spectre) was struck by Jerusalem's "clutter" and  said that out of its clutter an image can clearly appear.  He came  away seeing that "there is a throne in every man . . . it is the throne  of God."
       
Each  reader came away with different images.  Jane Parkinson (the  Cathedral Cities) was most struck by how Los' anvil tempers "the harmony  and cacophony."  Chris Rowland (Jesus) saw "the image of the child  leading the old man through London."  Tony (the Sons) saw naked  heroes, distorted, battling implacable forces.  The poem speaks to  different readers in very different ways. It cannot be tidily  interpreted.
       
Francis  Gilbert (Eternals), Barbara Vellacott (Vala), and I (Jerusalem) were  particularly struck by the text's holisitic nature.  As dawn  filtered through the mullioned windows Francis noted that the many  deaths, resurrections, and divisions came together in the Fourfold  Vision.  "I felt something like a resurrection in myself," he said,  "and all the others made sense."
       
I  am in the second year of my theology D.Phil. at Queen's College.   Guided by the goodness of Chris Rowland I have pored over Jerusalem's  minute particulars.  Blake's Eternals say: "Expanding we behold as  One. . . ."  Giving the text to eleven voices expands it.   Now Jerusalem is an organism of imagery, a vast speaking  picture.  The movement of heard words is like a mobius strip of  Blake design.  The poem tells a story, yet everything in it is  always happening.  Vala's shuttles sing in the sky; I see the  mundane egg, woven and forged, the daughters whipped, their fury, the  anvil and Los; a cycle of violence, love in a Lily; Jesus always  is.  Beulah wings morph into black dragon wings which become  seraphim flames of ruby and gold.  The lake of fire is living  water.  Ulro, Beulah, and Eden always are; they are ways of  perceiving.  Altering perception is especially important back home  in America, whose altars (in Jerusalem's words) now "run with blood" as  "Euphrates is red with blood" (Jerusalem 79:53-69).  The  poem presents a choice.  Moral Virtue and Life grow on very  different trees.  "The arts of life they changed into the arts of  death" can be changed again to arts of life.  Jerusalem is a poem whose time has come.

Metal material  in Jerusalem copy E All descriptions of the metal material (based on the plates observed under magnification, April 2006) and images by Angus Whitehead; reproduction by permission of the Yale Center for British Art, Paul Mellon Collection (B1992.8.1(1-107)). 
 
William Blake, Jerusalem copy E, pl. 14, "One hair nor particle   of dust ..." (detail). Relief   etching printed in orange, with pen, watercolor, and gold, 13 1/2 x 10 3/8   in. (34.3 x 26.4 cm.)
 

 
 There is a fairly thick streak   of gold on the right-hand side of the plate running outside and parallel with   the rainbow. From the upper left to the right-hand end of the rainbow,   running through its center, there are specks and patches of metal material forming   a fairly continuous arc of gold. There is a large patch of shell silver (or   possibly an alloy or very light gold) in the middle of the lower four stars inside the arc of the rainbow. Only the middle of each star is gildedâperhaps   Blake could not sufficiently control the metal material to color the outer   points of the stars without going beyond their edges. 
 
William Blake, Jerusalem copy E, pl. 63, "Jehovah stood   among the Druids ..." (detail). Relief etching printed in orange, with pen,   watercolor, and gold, 13 1/2 x 10 3/8 in. (34.3 x 26.4 cm.)
 

 
Small specks of gold material are visible under the female's tresses,   and larger patches can be traced below her armpit. From her lower right thigh   onwards, there is a significant amount of shell gold extending down to the   right of her feet. All of this material has been applied on the green (watercolor   wash?) the figure and the worm recline upon. To the right there is a patch   of shell gold to the right of the worm's rightmost extremity. Light   gold has been applied around and between the rays of the crescent moon. Also some specks are evident around the bottom of the crescent moon. 
 
William Blake, Jerusalem copy E, pl. 97, "Awake! Awake Jerusalem   ..," (detail). Relief etching printed in orange, with pen, watercolor, and gold,   13 1/2 x 10 3/8 in. (34.3 x 26.4 cm.)
 

 
 Silver or light gold material is evident on the left-hand side of the crescent   moon. Numerous streaks and patches of gold material surround the sun in Los'(?)   left hand. There are several spots of gold to the left of his arm and shoulder.   Behind Los, a line of specks of gold extends from below his armpit to the top   of the grass intersecting with his left calf.
 
Notes on metal material on other Jerusalem copy E     plates
 
Pl. 1    Very small flecks of shell gold are apparent above   either side of the archway, especially to the left. There are two vertical   thin (ruled?) lines to the right of the top of the arch and five similar lines   at the bottom left-hand outer corner of the arch, probably applied with a pen.   These lines run parallel to lines applied in dark ink. There   is also gold material (probably shell gold) on the inner apex of the arch.   There   are thicker applications of shell gold (reminiscent of those on Marriage  copy   I [see article, pp. 89, 90]) to the left of Los's left knee and on   the edge of the top of the lamp he is carrying; also on the inner edge of the   right side of the arch and on the very right of the print to the right   of Los's lamp. An "arc" of small specks of shell gold surrounding the lamp forms a  halo. 
 
Pl. 2   Shell gold has been applied in pen gilding the letters âJerusalemâ   (but not on âTheâ); on âEmaâ and the left-hand side of ânâ (but not on âation   ofâ); not   on âTheâ; only on âGâ of âGiantâ; only on âAlbiâ and on left-hand side of âoâ;   not on ân.â These details are only apparent in direct light (at YCBA, Department   of Prints and Drawings, I saw them in bright "studio" conditions, under magnification,   as I sat with a large window   overlooking a fairly wide street to my left). Blake has evidently colored   the remaining ungilded letters in a gold-looking yellow, which from a distance   is fairly indistinguishable from the gold. This begs the question, first posed   by Rosamund Paice (see article, p. 101): was Blake making a point or economizing?   It is unclear (even under magnification) if the bottom inscription is in gold. I doubt it. Minute dots and lines of shell gold, probably applied with a pen,   are evident on the wings of the top right-hand figure and on the back of the   headgear and at the nape of the neck of the figure middle left. In the latter   case a series of small specks forms a pattern (as in pl. 1; see above). There appears to be a speck of gold over the figure middle left's right eye. On the grieving (?) figure, middle right, there are gold highlights, applied with a pen, in her hair (?) trailing from the back of her hat and on wings. Gold is similarly applied to highlight the ribbon or line on her mobcap/flower hat. Shell gold is also present on the sun and crescent moon on her wings. Shell gold applied with a pen is used to highlight the top half of her dress, as well as the stars on the back of her dress (blue area of this garment). On the bottom figure there is a profusion of carefully placed gold highlights in her hair, similar to those in hair of the grieving (?) figure, middle right (see above). There are also subtle touches of gold around the bottom figure's lower torso. Quite thick curved lines of gold have been applied (one on either side) on her upper wings. Shell gold has been used to outline the red circle on the upper-right wing. There are touches of shell gold towards the edge of the wing nearest the adjacent figure. On the middle section of the figure's right wing there are parallel lines in gold applied in pen which appear to echo the effect of the line engraving on the copperplate (apparent in the red edges of the bottom wing, almost certainly the monochrome print media). Numerous stars on both lower wings have been gilded in shell gold (this application of gold material over a blue watercolor wash appears to parallel similar details on the bottom right figure's lower dress, discussed above). There is evidence of gold material along the outer edge of the bottom figure's right leg. On the middle area of her right wing (where her body appears to merge into the wing) there are lines of gold, again probably applied in pen. On the same wing, shell gold has been used to outline the circular area of the moon in eclipse.
 
Pl. 23   In this plate there are seemingly indiscriminate   applications of shell gold and perhaps shell silver in all three designs.   Top     design: on the figure's left wing there is a fairly large patch of shell   gold in the center, and two smaller specks (probably shell silver)   of a lighter color immediately to its left. Smaller specks of the same lighter color are apparent nearer the left tip of this wing. Middle design: a smear of light-colored   shell gold to the left of the head of the smaller kneeling figure on the left.   There is a hardly visible trace of light gold top right-hand side of the tree   trunk base (?). In addition, there are specks of the same light gold on the   left-hand side of the rock to the right of the large right-hand figure. On   the right-hand side of the same rock (to the right of the small bald figure   resting on his arm) there are faint touches of light gold towards the top of the design and larger specks of dark gold towards the bottom. Bottom design: at the top of the design a series of patches of thick dark gold interspersed with four small patches of light gold. The very bottom of the design is highlighted from the left to the center by a series of small patches of lighter gold: almost a continuous line, followed by a large gap in the middle bottom. From middle right bottom to right bottom smaller patches of light gold. Small specks of a darker gold have been applied to the right-hand rock (to the right of the furthest right-hand figure).
 
Pl. 25   Dark gold is very distinctly apparent under the   left hand, arm and around the right flank of the top figure. This application appears to echo the effect of the red and blue covering   or raining down on the left-hand female and male figure. The same material   is particularly in evidence just above the male figure's left shoulder  and above his brow. Similar dark gold material is present just to the   left of the left-hand figure's middle back and around the upper area of her   right buttock above the rock. There is a tiny speck of light gold material   on the top half of the rock she is sitting on; two specks of dark gold material   toward the bottom of the rock; one on the edge of the rock where it begins   to be obscured by shadow; one near the male figure's outer thigh (nearest the   rock).|   Immediately below the rock there is a line of dark gold made of small     patches (perhaps applied with a small dabber?). A few specks of the same color     gold just below this. From below the male figure's left inner calf to the     right-hand female figure's left toes are a series of patches of light and     dark gold. Some light gold material is visible below the male figure's left     foot. Dark gold material is visible near the right-hand figure's left heel.     Light and dark gold patches are also visible on the top and right-hand edges     of the hewn block the right-hand figure is sitting on. Tiny specks of gold     material appear to be raining down from the top figure's left hand down the   right figure's back.   Three small red-tinged specks of gold material, flame-like   in shape, have been applied just above the right-hand figure's pubic region.   These appear to echo the vegetal-looking lines in the background revealed in   the space between her waist and the back of her upper left arm. 
 
Pl. 47    In the space between the right-hand figure's left   hand and head there are specks of light gold material. Interestingly, there   is also a larger patch of lighter gold in the same area, very close to the   right-hand figure's head. Blake has glazed over this with blue watercolor,   producing a silvery-blue effect (perhaps Blake glazing gold with a cooling   colorâgiving the appearance of silver?âas noticed by Smith on The   Last Judgment: see article, pp. 84-85). Light gold material has also   been applied under both of the male figure's upper arms, especially the left   one, enhancing his outline against the dark background. Also near the male   figure's rump there is an extended patch of light gold. This emphasizes the adjacent   shadow above it. There are extended patches of light gold material (on the   left side) and dark gold material (on the right side) on the upper edges of the object supporting the male figure. 
 
Pl. 59    Specks of gold material are apparent under the right   arm of the left-hand figure, also to the left   and right of her head. The same material has been applied around and within   the spokes of both spinning wheels. A fairly large patch of gold material is   visible directly above the right-hand spinning wheel. Two other patches of   gold on either side of this wheel have a muddied look and appear to have mixed   with the black ink or paint Blake has used to highlight the image. There are   also patches of gold material above and under the arms of the middle female   figure, as well as under the arm of the right-hand female figure. This figure   also has a tiny speck of gold on her extended arm (compare to Robert N. Essick's mention   of a similar application to the raised and extended arm of the standing figure   in "The Divine Image," Innocence copy Yâsee caption   to illus. 4 in Blake 41.4 [spring 2008]: 146). All gold material on   pl. 59 appears to be a lighter gold, though some applications appear   to have reddish spots (perhaps Blake added red pigment to the shell gold)?
 
Pl. 75   Upper design: patches of gold material are visible     at the intersections of the circles as well as around the heads of the angels.     The application here seems rather patchy: perhaps some metal material has dislodged from the paper support. On the head of the fourth angel from the right there appear to be traces of shell silver. Lower design: intermittent patches of gold material     are visible on the outlines of the majority of circles on the coils of the     creature surrounding the right-hand female's left thigh, as well as on the     bottom half of the right-hand female herself. Gold material is also visible     on and around the eyes of each of the reptile-like creatures (except the     one bottom right). Gold material is present on the left-hand female     figure's lower back and buttocks and on the scales below her buttocks. Also     a large patch of gold is visible on the back of the neck of the third creature from the left. 
 
Pl. 76   On the small circles of round fruit under the trees/Jesus's arms, small patches     of gold are visible, again a case of the material having become     slightly "muddied" by the dark paint media it has been applied to. 
 
Pl. 81    At the top of the clouds, dark and light thick gold   patches are visible. Shell gold has been used to outline the edges of several   clouds and to fill in the smaller spaces between the outlines. A dark shell   gold is present in the bottom left-hand corner. Again, perhaps the material has mixed with dark watercolor media. A thick application of gold is evident to the left     of the left-hand figure's left arm and lower back. Intermittent thick applications     of gold outline the clouds on either side of this figure, just below the     text. Patches of light and dark gold are evident around the ball of her crossed     left foot. A large patch of gold is visible beneath the arm of the bottom right female as well as a small patch of gold on the head of the same figure. 
 
Pl. 84   Gold is apparent on the setting sun on the horizon. However, only a few patches have been used to highlight the sun. 
 
Pl. 94    Bottom design: specks of gold on the horizon are used to indicate sunset (?).
 
Pl. 100   Gold material is evident at the center of the sun. Patches of gold are apparent running down the left     flank of the left-hand figure extending from shoulder to toes (left-hand   figure's left). A few specks are evident along his right leg. Specks and patches   of light and dark colored gold are evident along the bottom of the tail of   the Stonehenge table on the left. Similar patches are present on most of the   base of Stonehenge. Several patches of gold are present on the top of the Stonehenge     temple. The same material is also evident on the left-hand part of the bottom     of the right-hand tail (rightmost ring?) of the temple. Patches of gold     material are evident around the base of the right point of the tongs the middle figure holds in his left hand.     Gold material is also present near the heels of both feet of the right-hand     female. Finally, prominent patches of gold material are apparent along the same figure's right hip.
