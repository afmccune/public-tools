			Dear Sir<lb/>

			equally or even more convenient as the Press being <lb/>
			already there would Save a good deal of time &amp; trouble <lb/>
			in taking down &amp; putting up which is no slight job. Also <lb/>
			the light is better in <lb/>
			our Kitchen if <lb/>
			there is but room enough.<lb/>

              </head>
              <p>The most massive and impressive scholarly publishing event of 2004 was the appearance of the revised <hi rend="i">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>, entitled the <hi rend="i">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</hi>, in Association with the British Academy, from the Earliest Times to the Year 2000, ed. H. C. G. Matthew and Brian Harrison (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), hard copy and online, in 61 volumes all published simultaneously on 23 September 2004. Most of the hundred-some biographies I looked at were newly written, not merely revisions of those in the <hi rend="i">DNB.</hi></p>
              <p>I have stalked individuals who, though often very minor, played a significant role in the life of William Blake as they appear first in <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, Second Edition (2004) and then in the <hi rend="i">ODNB.</hi></p>
              <p>Most of those in the <hi rend="i">ODNB</hi> earned their place because they made a mark in the great world—generals, politicians, bankers, and the like. It is telling that there is a standard section for wealth at death. Of those connected with Blake, a disproportionate number are men of power and influence, his patrons, rather than mere friends or fellow artists and engravers.</p>
              <p>The <hi rend="i">ODNB</hi> is especially good on archives.</p>
              <p>The <hi rend="i">ODNB</hi> omits separate entries on Elizabeth Aders (b. 1785), patroness of Blake, and her husband Charles; Thomas Armitage (1722-51), haberdasher, and his wife Catherine who remarried after his death and became the poet’s mother; Robert Balmanno (1780-1860), collector; James Blake, the poet’s grandfather; James Blake, the poet’s father; James Blake, the poet’s brother; Robert Blake, the poet’s brother; Stephen Blake, haberdasher with the Blake firm in 1783-84 (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] xxxi, 735 and fn.); Rebekah Bliss, collector (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 65-66, 444 and fn., 844); Boucher, natal family of Blake’s wife; William Brereton, JP at Blake’s 1803 trial (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 167); Thomas Butts (1757-1845), clerk, Blake’s patron; Edward John and James H. Chance, Linnell’s nephews and assistants (see, e.g., <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 433 and fn.); Private John Cock, dragoon, perjured supporter of the allegation of sedition against Blake in August 1803; Richard Dally, Blake’s Chichester solicitor (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 175, 185fn.); Maria Denman, sister-in-law of John Flaxman, friend of Blake; Sir Edward Denny, patron of Blake; Mrs. Enoch, Blake’s neighbor in South Molton Street (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 750); James Ferguson (1791-1871), artist, patron of Blake’s widow (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 481fn., 496 and fn., 497); John Giles, Samuel Palmer’s cousin, disciple of Blake (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 404); Samuel Greatheed, patron of Blake; Dr. William Guy, Hayley’s physician (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 126, 183); Joseph Hogarth (fl. 1860-78), print dealer; Major George Hulton, dragoon, who preferred charges of sedition against Blake in 1803 (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 164-67); Elizabeth Iremonger, collector (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 298 and fn., 299, 601fn.); Joan Linnell Ivimy, custodian of the Linnell family papers; Richard Charles Jackson (1851-1923), wishful collector of Blake (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 320fn., 745fn., 747fn., 877); James Lahee, copperplate printer of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> (1826); James Linnell, framemaker, father of John; Herschel M. Margoliouth, scholar; Edward Garrard Marsh (1783-1862), poet, friend of Blake; Rev. Anthony Stephen Mathew (1733-1824), patron of Blake, and his wife Harriet and son Henry; John Peachey (1752-1830), JP at Blake’s trials in 1803 and 1804 (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 167, 179); R. Pontifex, printseller (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 345fn., 823); Henrietta Poole (d. 1827), friend of Hayley and Blake; John Quantock (1740-1820), JP at Blake’s trials in 1803 and 1804; William Saunders, picture dealer (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 178 and fn., 188, 194); Private John Scholfield (Scolfield), perjured accuser of Blake of sedition; Joseph Seagrave, Chichester printer, defender of Blake; Thomas Siv[e]wright, of Meggetland, Blake collector (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 344fn., 864); John Clark Strange (b. 1826), corn chandler, biographer of Blake (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 707-32); Arthur Tatham (1809-74), brother of Frederick; Frederick Tatham (1805-78), artist, biographer of Blake (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 661-91); Rev. Joseph Thomas, rector of Epsom, Blake’s patron; and James Vine, patron of Blake.</p>
              <p>Most of these omitted individuals are pretty minor, but then some pretty minor characters are included in the <hi rend="i">ODNB</hi>, such as Thomas Hayley (1780-1800), who was merely the natural son of Thomas Hayley and who did not even outlive his apprenticeship, and Catherine Blake (1762-1831), who is important to no one but William Blake and his admirers. She is doubtless included to fulfill the mandate of including more women than in the <hi rend="i">DNB.</hi> The entries which I found containing new information include: Blake’s biographer Allan Cunningham, manuscript “lives of painters and related corresp.” including his life of Blake (1830) in the National Library of Scotland (see the entry in Part VI); Blake’s friend and patron Ozias Humphry, catalogue of his art collection (which once included <hi rend="i">America</hi> [H], <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> [O], Large Book of Designs [A], <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> [H], and Small Book of Designs [A]) in the British Library, Add. MS 49682;<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> Blake’s reluctant patron Charles Henry Bellenden Ker, who was baptized 18 February 1787 (not 1785? as in <hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 302-03); Blake’s printshop

partner James Parker, who was born in 1757, not in 1750 as in <hi rend="i">BR</hi> (2) and <hi rend="i">DNB</hi>; and Blake’s lawyer Samuel Rose, whose correspondence is in Glasgow University Library. <note id="n1">1. However, I am told by Susanne Sklar that the document is a kind of commonplace book by Humphry’s natural son William Upcott, with some notes on his collection but no reference to Blake.</note></p>
              <p>The <hi rend="i">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</hi> is an immense and immensely valuable resource.</p>

                </title>
              </head>
              <p>Only a few score letters by Blake are known, and for a few letters no more is yet known than the date or the recipient. The last new Blake letter discovered was that of 1 September 1800 acquired by Robert N. Essick &lt;<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> (1998)&gt;.</p>
              <p>Consequently the appearance of a new Blake letter, entirely without fanfare, not to say ballyhoo and hullabaloo, is rare and welcome. A previously unknown letter entered the archives of the bookseller John Murray at an unknown date in the nineteenth century, alone and palely loitering, and was exhibited quietly at the exhibition of illustrations of <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> at Dove Cottage in 2004—so quietly that even distinguished Blake scholars did not register that the letter was previously unknown.</p>
              <p>This letter, with its postmark of 25 November 1825, indicates the makeshift conditions of Blake’s printing, at least in his last years, setting up his press in the kitchen of his landlord and neighbor Henry Banes. The work to be printed may be his great series for the Book of Job, the earliest professional proofs of which were pulled on 4-5 March 1825, first by Dixon and then by Lahee. The printer referred to in the text may well be James Lahee; see the appendix here.</p>
              <p>The letter also contains the only known reference in Blake’s writings to his brother-in-law Henry Banes, the husband of his wife’s sister Sarah. The relationship of Henry Banes and William Blake was clearly a friendly one, if Banes was willing to give up his kitchen, perhaps for an indefinite time, for Blake’s printing.</p>
              <p>How many more such Blake treasures remain to be discovered in long-neglected archives and attics? And how grateful we should be when they do finally reach a wider public.</p>

                <p>In the last year or so, several important works by Blake peered shyly from the boskage, and then, when a hue and cry arose, disappeared without leaving a forwarding address. A previously unrecorded copy of <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> (Q?), <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> (N), and nineteen watercolors for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> appeared only long enough to be identified and then withdrew, like the Cheshire Cat. Of these, the Blair designs disappeared for 165 years (1836-2001) and surfaced briefly in 2001, only to disappear in 2004 into a bank vault where they are invisible to enquirers who are not heavy in the purse. <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> was assessed by a bookseller and then disappeared once more. And <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> (N), never seen and described by a Blake scholar and not confidently traced since 1921, did not appear when its mate <hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen</hi> (E) in the Whitney collection was sold in 1999 for a world record price for a book. Then in the summer of 2004 <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> was brought off the street to Swann Galleries in New York and was to be offered for auction, until the Whitney family got wind of the affair and tied the book up with legal proceedings. As a consequence, <hi rend="i">none</hi> of these works is visible to Blake scholars or lovers, and indeed even their ownership is unknown or obscure.</p>

                <p>This summary of discoveries and publications on Blake in 2004 covers 40 books on Blake (9 of them editions, 6 catalogues), 139 essays, 6 dissertations, and 79 reviews. Most of course are in English, but 36 are in other languages, including Dutch (2), French (3), German (2), Italian (3, plus <hi rend="i">Italian Studies</hi>), Japanese (15, including 2 editions and an essay in English in a Japanese publication), Korean (6), Spanish (4, including 3 editions), and Swedish (1, plus a book in English published in Sweden). In comparison, last year’s checklist documented 50 books (8 of them catalogues, 17 editions), 205 essays, and 47 reviews.</p>
                <p>The most important Blake discovery published in 2004 was the fact that Blake’s mother Catherine and her first husband Thomas Armitage joined the Moravian Church in 1750. This in turn led to facts about her birthplace in Walkeringham, Nottinghamshire, about her family, and about a previously unknown son of the Armitages named Thomas who died at the age of one in 1751. The Armitages were members of the Moravian Church only briefly, in 1750-51, for both Thomas Armitages, father and son, died in 1751, and when Catherine Armitage “Became a Widow . . . [she] left the Congregation.” She may have left the congregation because she had married outside the Moravian community, and there is no evidence that James Blake was a Moravian. All this gives a firm context to Crabb Robinson’s statement that “Blake does not belong by birth to the established church, but to a dissenting community” (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 599), though it is still unclear what influence the Moravians had upon the poet or indeed whether his mother ever talked about them. It would be agreeable to think that she sang to her children the Moravian hymm which she quoted in her application to join the church:
<q>
Here let me drink for ever drink<lb/>
nor never once depart<lb/>
for what I tast makes me to cry<lb/>
fix at this Spring My heart<lb/>
Dear Savour thou hast seen how oft<lb/>
I’ve turnd away from thee<lb/>
O let thy work renewd to day<lb/>
Remain eternally
</q></p>
                <p>The documentary evidence that Catherine Armitage and her husband joined the Moravian Church was discovered by Marsha Keith Schuchard and displayed by her and Keri Davies in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 38.1 (2004): 36-43, and at greater length in Keri Davies’ Surrey doctoral dissertation (2003). This is one of the most remarkable and illuminating dissertations on Blake which has appeared since Bo Lindberg’s <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Illustrations to the Book of Job</hi> (1973), and Davies now has a fellowship to continue his researches on the Nottinghamshire and Moravian contexts of Catherine Blake, which promises great things for the future.</p>
                <p>Two of the most sensational aspects of Moravian worship were the loving emphasis upon Christ’s “warm hot jowcy wounds” and the connection between religious communion and sexual intercourse, which was called fellowship. The enthusiasm with which the twenty-first century press greeted this last feature may be imagined.<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref><note id="n2">2. See the entry for Martin Wainwright in Part VI.</note></p>
                <p>Three of the books reported here will throw long shadows on the world of Blake scholarship.</p>
                <p>The first is Morton Paley’s <hi rend="i">The Traveller in the Evening: The Last Works of William Blake</hi> (2003), which is a fitting culmination both for the works of William Blake and for the critical career of Morton Paley. His criticism now covers all Blake’s creations, with <hi rend="i">Energy and the Imagination: A Study of the Development of Blake’s Thought</hi> (1970) and <hi rend="i">The Continuing City: William Blake’s</hi> Jerusalem (1983), and <hi rend="i">The Traveller in the Evening</hi> is perhaps the best of them—comprehensive, novel, and illuminating on every page. For instance, Paley points out that in <hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi> Eve faints by Abel’s grave, but there is no grave or burial of Abel in Genesis or in Byron’s <hi rend="i">Cain.</hi> However, both appear in Gessner’s <hi rend="i">Death of Abel.</hi> He demonstrates, with measurements, that when Blake’s woodcuts for Virgil were cut down the designs lost up to 40% of their area, and he shows conclusively that the cryptic and fascinating engraving always called “Laocoön” (a term not used for it by Blake) should really be identified as “<rtl>יה</rtl> &amp; his two Sons Satan &amp; Adam.”<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref><note id="n3">3. The important essay on “<rtl>יה</rtl> &amp; his two Sons” first appeared in <hi rend="i">Studies in Romanticism</hi> (2002).</note></p>
                <p>The second epochal book recorded here is the collection of remarkably fine and original essays edited by Joyce H. Townsend called <hi rend="i">William Blake: The Painter at Work</hi> (2003), dealing with the physical materials of Blake’s visual art. It is full of fascinating matter. How many of us could have said that there is no surviving original frame for any of Blake’s pictures? Robin Hamlyn records, with diagrams, Blake’s painting rooms; Joyce Townsend herself reproduces almost all the watercolor pigments commercially available in Blake’s time; Peter Bower adds enormously to the information available about the paper Blake used;<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> and elsewhere there is evidence of the specific colorman whose products Blake used—R. Davy of 16 Wardour Street (131, 145)—and a palette in the Victoria and Albert Museum which Blake may have owned about 1820
<pb id="p39-7" n="7"/>
(181). The photographs reproduced are wonderfully novel and illuminating. This is an extraordinarily original and valuable book. <note id="n4">4. For instance, “there are some forty different papers, several of which were used by Blake, watermarked 1794 / J WHATMAN” (55), though in records of Blake’s watermarks these forty different watermarks are not distinguished from one another (e.g., <hi rend="i">BB</hi> 71-73).</note></p>
                <p>The third of the books which is likely to have long influence is G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> Second Edition: Documents (1714-1841) Concerning the Life of William Blake (1757-1827) and His Family, Incorporating <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> (1969), <hi rend="i">Blake Records Supplement</hi> (1988), and Extensive Discoveries since 1988 (2004). In comparison with the works it incorporates:

                <p>New information beyond <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> and <hi rend="i">Blake Records Supplement</hi> is incorporated throughout the second edition; the most significant addition is “John Clark Strange MS Journal (1859-61)” (707-32), which provides the notes Strange made for the biography of Blake which he proposed to write—but never did. The most important omission from <hi rend="i">BR</hi> (2) is information about the membership of Blake’s mother (before his birth) in the Moravian congregation in Fetter Lane, London, information which did not become available until after <hi rend="i">BR</hi> (2) was in print. The second edition of <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> is likely to prove as useful as its first two parts have been.</p>
                <p>A new and one hopes definitive edition of Northrop Frye’s immensely influential <hi rend="i">Fearful Symmetry</hi>, ed. Nicholas Halmi (2004), includes not only the prefaces to the editions of 1962 and 1969 but also the Italian preface to the edition in Italian of 1976, and identifications—sometimes with corrections—of Frye’s sources. This is the edition which careful critics will use in future.</p>
                <p>Julia M. Wright’s <hi rend="i">Blake, Nationalism, and the Politics of Alienation</hi> (2004) “follows Blake from his subversion of the linearity that enables neoclassical nationalist narratives, to his critique of the replicated text, to his own replicating imperialist vision” (xxxiii).</p>
                <p>The discovery by Angus Whitehead of four new directories of 1795-1799<ref target="n5" type="note">5</ref> indicates that the poet-engraver and his brother were not so obscure as has often been thought, though in one of them the poet masquerades under the name “William Blocke” at 13, Hercules Buildings. <note id="n5">5.

                </head>
                <p>Among the most important tools of scholarship are the invaluable annual records of sales of works by and related to Blake and the records of publications and discoveries about Blake which appear in Robert N. Essick, “Blake in the Marketplace, 2003” and in G. E. Bentley, Jr., Hikari Sato, and Ching-erh Chang, “William Blake and His Circle” in <hi rend="i">Blake/ An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> 37.4 (2004): 116-36, and 38.1 (2004): 4-35. Very few scholars read through these records, but all responsible Blake scholars will consult them.</p>
                <p>Several other essays of major importance appeared in <hi rend="i">Blake/ An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> in 2004. Keri Davies and Marsha Keith Schuchard, “Recovering the Lost Moravian History of William Blake’s Family,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 38.1 (2004): 36-43, is the first factual published account of Blake and the Moravians,<ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref> though it was also included in Davies’ unpublished dissertation of 2003. <note id="n6">6. Somewhat oddly, they say that for Blake’s dissenting context there is “next to no evidence” (36n3), though in 1810 Crabb Robinson wrote quite plainly, though in German, that “Blake does not belong by birth to the established church, but to a dissenting community” (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 599).</note></p>
                <p>Mary Lynn Johnson, “Blake’s Engravings for Lavater’s Physiognomy,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 38.2 (2004): 52-74, provides fascinating verbal and graphic detail for the history of the images in Lavater’s famous and enormously influential book. It had been published in German and French, but one of the images Blake engraved was not originally an illustration of Lavater at all, though Blake would not have known this.
<q>
A loose and shifting corpus of chronologically overlapping Lavater-authorized material made its way from Switzerland and Germany (with a side trip to the Netherlands) through France, leaking intellectual property rights and potential profits at every turn .... (52)
</q>
In their migrations, the images unwittingly altered in iconography and significance. For instance, the feminine arm holding a torch surrounded by moths engraved by Blake in 1789 had been, in Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Physiognomische Fragmente</hi> (1778), a masculine arm being stung by wasps, where it is “an emblem of Lavater’s resolve in the face of his detractors” (65).</p>
                <p>Michael Phillips, “The Printing of Blake’s <hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi>,” <hi rend="i">Print Quarterly</hi> 21 (2004): 18-38, presents extensive evidence from Phillips’ own printing experiments in support of the conclusion that Blake’s “progress in printing was necessarily slow” by John Jackson, <hi rend="i">A Treatise on Wood Engraving</hi> (1839). Jackson’s conclusion was perhaps based upon his firsthand experience with Blake. Phillips made metal facsimiles of Blake’s <hi rend="i">America</hi> plates and tried to print them as Blake did. It took him 34-35 minutes to ink each plate satisfactorily because of the need to wipe the ink out of the hollows in the copper (31). At this rate, Blake would have needed a week to make ten sets of <hi rend="i">America.</hi></p>
                <p>The length of time seems surprising, for, according to Joseph Collyer, <hi rend="i">The Parent’s and Guardian’s Directory, and the Youth’s Guide in the Choice of a Profession or Trade</hi> (London: R. Griffiths, 1761) 118, the whole process of printing from copperplates “is done with such expedition, that a large plate of a whole sheet is blacked, cleaned, and worked off, in less than a minute.” And this is for an intaglio plate; a relief plate should be far quicker.</p>
                <pb id="p39-8" n="8"/>
                <p>Phillips presents invaluable and previously unrecorded evidence as to the thickness of Blake’s copperplates and the depth to which he etched them.</p>

              <p>This division is organized by individual (say, William Hayley or John Flaxman), with works by and about Blake’s friends and patrons, living individuals with whom he had significant direct and demonstrable contact. It includes Thomas Butts and his family, Robert Hartley Cromek, George Cumberland, John Flaxman and his family, Henry Fuseli, Thomas and William Hayley, John Linnell and his family, Samuel Palmer, James Parker, George Richmond, Henry Crabb Robinson, Thomas Stothard, John Varley, and Thomas Griffiths Wainewright. It does <hi rend="i">not</hi> include important contemporaries with whom Blake’s contact was negligible or non-existent, such as John Constable and William Wordsworth and Edmund Burke. Such major figures are dealt with more comprehensively elsewhere, and the light they throw upon Blake is very dim.</p>
              <p>Reviews, listed here under the book reviewed, are only for works which are substantially about Blake, not for those with only, say, a chapter on Blake. The authors of the reviews may be recovered from the index.</p>

              <p>The status of electronic “publications” becomes increasingly vexing. Some such works seem to be merely electronic versions of physically stable works, and some suggest no more knowledge than how to operate a computer, such as reviews invited for the listings of the book sale firm of Amazon.com, which are divided into those by (1) the author, (2) the publisher, and (3) other, perhaps disinterested, remarkers. I have not searched for electronic publications, and I report here only those I have happened upon which appear to bear some authority. Many periodicals (including newspapers), books, and authors (e.g., Joseph Viscomi—see entry in Part VI) now have electronic shadows online; this duplication is recorded here only when my evidence comes from the electronic version, or when the electronic version differs significantly from the three-dimensional copy.</p>

                    <p>Pl. 96</p>
                    <p>There are irregularities on pl. 96, such as the white-line striations as of shading at the bottom left of the design and a strong—and graphically irrelevant—horizontal line across the knee of the man, which suggest that Blake’s relief etching is over an intaglio engraving. <hi rend="i">BB</hi> p. 225 says merely that “Something else seems to have been originally engraved under the present etching,” and none of the facsimiles I have now [2004] looked at—C (1955), D (1877), E (1955, 1991, William Blake Archive), and H (<hi rend="i">William Blake’s Writings</hi> [1978])—enables me to be more precise.</p>
                    <p>However, David V. Erdman, “The Suppressed and Altered Passages in Blake’s <hi rend="i">Jerusalem,” Studies in Bibliography</hi> 17 (1964): 36-38, says that he sees in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl. 96,
<q>
a good deal of submerged cross-hatching in the area below the center of the picture and along its left side near the text, the only distinguishable form being a perspective drawing of what looks like a small Grecian temple. From the top to the center of the picture some 7 irregularly spaced lines of cursive italic writing are fragmentarily visible, as white loops across the thick outlines of Blake’s drawing. In the Rosenbloom copy [of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (J) pl. 96] the first words are decipherable as “The Greatest” . . . the first words, in the same cursive engraver’s lettering, of a commercial manifesto . . . for “Moore &amp; Co’s Manufactory &amp; Warehouse of Carpets”
</q>
which Blake engraved in 1797 or 1798.<ref target="n25" type="note">25</ref> He identifies the readings of “the visible seven lines” from Blake’s “Moore &amp; Co” advertisement, though he does not actually say that they are legible. And he concludes that “<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 96 is etched on a piece of copper cut from the lower left quarter (roughly speaking) of the [Moore &amp; Co] plate.” <note id="n25">25.

                    <p>After careful study with a magnifying glass, I can see the features of pl. 96 which suggest that the plate was previously used for something else, but can neither read any of these words nor even find precisely where they appear on the plate, nor can Susanne Sklar, who looked at copy J pl. 96 on my behalf.</p>

                  <p>Pl. 2 “King John Absolved by Pandulph”: The true-size drawing for it, acquired by Robert N. Essick, “bears all the hallmarks of a work by Fuseli, including the characteristic left-hand hatching strokes.” This is perhaps the clearest evidence to support the long-held belief that the designs to Allen’s books are by Fuseli.

                  <p>An engraving labelled “Job and His Family” (“Blake”—Anon.), image c. 5.8 × 9.0 cm., derives from Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> pl. “1” (16.5 × 21.3 cm.). In it the foreground sheep are omitted, two are moved to the flocks at the left and right, and a band of foliage is added. This is apparently the earliest repetition of Blake’s Job designs.</p>
                  <p>This tiny Bible (6.8 × 11.0 cm.), of a “convenient size for the Pocket,” with a preface signed “T.C.” as “the Editor,” may be rare; at any rate it, the Butlers, Northampton, and Buffalo do not appear in <hi rend="i">Historical Catalogue of Printed Editions of The English Bible 1525-1961</hi> Revised and Expanded from the Edition of T.

                  <p>The <hi rend="i">Polyglott</hi> in the title is justified only in the work from which the Butler edition was indirectly pirated: <hi rend="i">The English Version of the Polyglott</hi> [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] <hi rend="i">Bible</hi> . . . With a . . . selection of references to parallel and illustrative passages (London: Samuel Bagster, [1815,] 1816), with a preface signed “T.C.” for Thomas Chevalier; this <hi rend="i">English Version</hi> appeared with separately issued versions of the Bible in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, French, German, Italian, and Spanish (D&amp;M #1628). Bagster’s <hi rend="i">English Version</hi> was reprinted in 1819, 1825, 1826, 1828, 1831, 1833, 1834, 1838 [1840?], [1844] (3 varieties) (D&amp;M #1628) and in U.S. editions of 1825 [Philadelphia: Thomas Wardle, D&amp;M #1748], 1831 [Philadelphia: Key &amp; Meikle, D&amp;M #1785], 1837, 1841, 1842, and 1844—a total of “well over a hundred [U.S. versions of Bagster’s <hi rend="i">Polyglott</hi>] reprinted within fifty years” (D&amp;M #1628, 1785). Plainly the English text of Bagster’s <hi rend="i">Polyglott</hi> was freely pirated and frequently reprinted; apparently the only remarkable feature of the 1836 edition is in the illustrations.</p>

XLVIII, p. 123.</hi>” “<hi rend="i">Monument of Philippa Queen of Edward III. 1369</hi>” and “<hi rend="i">Basire del &amp; sc</hi>”. <note id="n33">33. Blake’s responsibility for the drawing is plausibly asserted by Malkin (<hi rend="i">BR</hi> [2] 563), and his responsibility for the engraving is a generally accepted hypothesis.</note></p>
                  <p>Gough wrote in pencil on the proof: “Mr Ashley your people have made a mistake which appears very extraordinary as it is very clearly wrote with only one 1—Philippa.”<ref target="n34" type="note">34</ref> Presumably “Mr Ashley” is the writing engraver, but there is no Ashley in <hi rend="i">Stationers’ Company Apprentices 1701-1800</hi>, ed.

                  <p>1 A vignette of two old men planting trees (Vol. I, p. 127) originally appeared in Gellert’s <hi rend="i">Leçons de Morale</hi> (1772) engraved by Daniel Nikolaus Chodowiecki, and Chodowiecki engraved another version (1772) for the Huguenot Seminaire françois de theologie à Berlin, where it indicates the fostering of young theology students. It was engraved, reversed, by Rudolf Schellenberg for Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Essai sur la physiognomonie</hi> I ([1781]) 127. Blake re-reversed the design and made minor alterations.</p>
                  <p>3 A female arm and hand delicately holding up a candle with moths nearby (Vol. I, p. 206) derives from an engraving (Anon.-Anon.) of a sturdy male arm and hand gripping a candle and being stung by a wasp in <hi rend="i">Essai</hi> I: 213, where its significance is not explained. It derives from a plate (Anon.-Anon.)
<pb id="p39-15" n="15"/>
in Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Physiognomische Fragmente</hi> IV (1778) (Vol. IV was never translated) where it represents Lavater’s determination to uphold the light of Truth in the face of the stings of public mockery.</p>
                  <p>4 A profile head of the Lutheran theologian Johann Joachim Spalding, a dear friend of both Lavater and Fuseli (Vol. I, p. 225), was first printed in Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Physiognomische Fragmente</hi> III (1777), 4 portraits on one plate after Chodowiecki engraved by Johann Heinrich Lips, and repeated, alone [?by Lips] in <hi rend="i">Essai</hi> I: 232.</p>

                  <p>Joseph Thomas. PROPOSALS | FOR PUBLISHING BY SUBSCRIPTION, | <hi rend="i">A Series of Engravings on Wood</hi>, | FROM | SCRIPTURAL SUBJECTS, | IN THE MANNER OF | <hi rend="i">QUARLES’S EMBLEMS</hi>, | AFTER THE | DESIGNS OF J. THURSTON, ESQ. | AND EXECUTED BY | THE MOST EMINENT ENGRAVERS ON WOOD. | THE SUBJECTS WILL BE SELECTED, AND THE DESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN, BY | <hi rend="i">THE REV. J. THOMAS, A.M.</hi> | Desirous that my Friend Mr. Thurston’s Talents, with which the World have long been | partially acquainted, should be more fully known, I thought <hi rend="i">Divine Emblems</hi> particularly suited | to his Genius, the Subjects for which might be selected from Quotations of Scripture, as in | Quarles’s celebrated Work on the same Subject: taking care to choose such only as were | best adapted to the Wants and Comforts of Man in his present State, and most likely to suggest | and enforce the due Preparation for a happy Immortality.</p>
                  <p>The Art of Engraving on Wood being yet in its Infancy, and presuming, with many respec- | table and distinguished Artists, that it is capable of producing Effects infinitely superior to what | has hitherto been seen, the Object of this Work is to present to the Public the most perfect Spe- | cimen that has ever yet been executed.</p>
                  <p>J. THOMAS.</p>
                  <p>CONDITIONS.</p>
                  <p>1. The Work will consist of Twenty Engravings, with a Head and Tail-piece, and will be printed in Royal | Quarto, on India Paper, by T. Bensley, in his best Style.</p>
                  <p>2. The Price to Subscribers will be Two Guineas . . . | . . . The Price will be considerably advanced to Non-Subscribers.</p>
                  <p>3. The Work is intended to be published with all due Dispatch. | Subscriptions are received by Robinson and Son, Paternoster Row; Miller, Albemarle Street; Williams, | Strand; Colnaghi, Cockspur Street; Deighton, Cambridge; and Cooke, Oxford; Parish, Circulating | Library, Epsom; Mr. Thurston, Twickenham Common; and the Rev. Joseph Thomas, Abele Grove, | near Epsom. | - | [<hi rend="i">Printed by Thomas Bensley</hi>] Bolt Court Printing Office, Fleet Street [<hi rend="i">?1809</hi>]. &lt;Glasgow University Library&gt; &lt;<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> §(2003)&gt;</p>
                  <p>The “List of Subscribers” in the prospectus and in the published work (Ackermann, 1809) &lt;<hi rend="i">BB</hi> #746&gt;) includes “William Blake, Esq.” who may well be the poet despite the elevating “Esq.” Almost all the males in the lists who have no other 
<pb id="p39-18" n="18"/>
title (Rev., Captain, Earl, Doctor) and who are not blatantly commercial (like the booksellers) are endowed with “Esq.”—even the Yorkshire engraver “R.H. Cromeck, Esq. 2 Copies”—just as tailors in Oxford used to do for undergraduates, even when they were benighted colonials. Note that the designer’s style is “J. THURSTON, ESQ.” but as a subscription collector he is “Mr. Thurston.”</p>
                  <p>The 138 subscribers include Blake’s friends and patrons W. S. Poyntz, Esq., John Flaxman, R.A., Richard Cosway, R.A., and Henry Fuseli, R.A., for 198 copies. The subscription list in the work as published has 178 subscribers for 249 copies, so this proposal apparently elicited 40 new subscribers (including Mr. Charles Heath, perhaps the engraver [1785-1848]) for 51 new copies.</p>
                  <p>R. H. [Robert Hunt] says in the <hi rend="i">Examiner</hi> (July 1808): 494, “We have lately seen some specimens” of it (there is no specimen with the prospectus) in which “Nothing . . . can exceed these specimens in richness, sweetness, and delicacy of tint,” and <hi rend="i">The Repository of Arts</hi> 2 (Sept. 1809): 183, 252, announced that the book would be published in September and reviewed it in October.</p>
                  <p>The subscription price of £2.2.0 is substantial for an engraver like Blake, the sum he might have expected for a week’s engraving work, but perhaps he had a special price or a gift because of his special relationship with the author who, according to Nancy Flaxman (Sept. 1805) “wishes to collect all B— has done.” Thomas commissioned from Blake his 6 watercolors for Milton’s <hi rend="i">Comus</hi>, 6 for his Shakespeare first folio (1806-09), 12 for <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> (1807), 6 for “On the Morning of Christ’s Nativity” (1809), and also bought Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> with Blake’s designs (1808) and <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (Q, 1810).</p>

                  <p>V. “Isaac Newton: the context of a private library” (187-224): Books in Tilloch’s remarkable library included scientific, alchemical, and astrological works which could have influenced Blake.</p>
                  <p>VI. “Samuel Varley: the context of (al)chemical science” (225-50): “Inflammable Gass, the Wind Finder” in <hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon</hi> is “most likely Samuel Varley” (232), uncle of Blake’s friend John Varley.</p>
                  <p>VII. “William Muir: a context for the <hi rend="i">Blake Press</hi> facsimiles” (251-78): “A first version” of Chapter VII was published in his “William Muir and the Blake Press at Edmonton with Muir’s Letters to Kerrison Preston,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 27.1 (1993): 14-25 (4).</p>
                  <p>VIII. “Catherine Wright: the religious context” (279-307): Blake’s mother and her first husband were members of the Moravian Church in Fetter Lane in 1750?-52, and their (previously unknown) baby was buried there in 1751.</p>

(Deals particularly with the rooms in which Blake painted, including previously unreproduced diagrams of the Blakes’ rooms at 17, South Molton Street [18, “drawn by Robin Hamlyn 2003”] and of their house at 13, Hercules Buildings [29, “Done Feb<hi rend="s">y</hi> 1853”].)</p>
                  <p>Bronwyn Ormsby and Joyce H. Townsend with Brian Singer and John Dean. “The State of Knowledge on William Blake the Painter.” 40-44, 177-78. (Heretofore “Blake’s paint medium for temperas and colour prints has not been investigated with great success” [44].)</p>
                  <p>*Joyce H. Townsend. “Analytical Methods.” 45-51, 178. (She reproduces “Almost the complete range of watercolour pigments available within Blake’s lifetime” [47].)</p>
                  <p>Part Two: Watercolours</p>
                  <p>*Peter Bower. “The Vivid Surface: Blake’s Use of Paper and Board.” 54-60, 178. (A learned and persuasive demonstration that “Understanding the nature and type of papers that Blake used is fundamental to an accurate understanding of his working practices” [56].)</p>
                  <p>*Noa Cahaner McManus and Joyce H. Townsend. “Watercolour Methods, and Materials Use in Context.” 61-79, 178-79. (They deal with Blake’s “pigments . . . with a focus on their appearance in Blake’s works, their properties, permanence and the likelihood of their use in his time” [68].)</p>
                  <p>Part Three: Large Colour Prints</p>
                  <p>*Noa Cahaner McManus and Joyce H. Townsend. “The Large Colour Prints: Methods and Materials.” 82-99, 179. (In “God Judging Adam,” the only “relief etched copper plate” among the large colour prints, “the colour printing was done in more than one pull,” but in “Naomi Entreating . . .,” “the colour printing was done in one pull” [84, 92].)</p>
                  <p>*Piers Townshend and Joyce H. Townsend. “The Conservation of a Large Colour Print: Satan Exulting over Eve.” 100-07, 179.</p>
                  <p>Part Four: Temperas</p>
                  <p>*Bronwyn Ormsby with Brian Singer and John Dean. “The Painting of the Temperas.” 110-33, 179-80. (“The structure of temperas such as <hi rend="i">Camoens</hi> and <hi rend="i">Chaucer</hi> [from the “Heads of the Poets”] has been made more complex by the presence of what is possibly an abandoned image underneath the final design” [122].)</p>
                  <p>*Bronwyn Ormsby with Joyce H. Townsend, Brian Singer and John Dean. “Blake’s Use of Tempera in Context.” 134-49, 180-81. (“Contrary to the historical accounts . . . that Blake rejected gum as a binder . . . the analysis of Blake’s tempera paints also revealed the consistent presence of a mixture of gums Arabic (or karaya) and tragacanth with the additions of sugar or honey, and occasionally cherry gum” [138].)</p>
                  <p>*Bronwyn Ormsby with Brian Singer and John Dean. “The Appearance of the Temperas Today.” 150-59, 181. (“Thirty per cent of Blake’s temperas have been lost through neglect and poor condition,” including the “almost complete repainting prior to 1885 of each of the eighteen ‘Heads of Poets,’” but “There appears to be little evidence of the wholesale fading of pigments on Blake’s temperas, and no remaining evidence of the blackening of the lead-based pigments reported by D.G. Rossetti [Gilchrist (1863)]” [157, 159].)</p>
                  <p>Part Five: Epilogue</p>
                  <p>*Joyce H. Townsend, Robin Hamlyn and John Anderson. “The Presentation of Blake’s Paintings.” 162-74, 181-82. (An account of the framing and display of Blake’s pictures in the past and the present, particularly at Tate.)</p>
                  <p>Anon. “Appendix 1: Watercolours Discussed in the Text.” 183. (Includes a column on “Colour Change.”)</p>
                  <p>Anon. “Appendix 2: Watercolours—Analytical Results.” 184. (In particular, “Lead White” was not used in the pictures examined.)</p>
                  <p>Anon. “Appendix 3: Large Colour Prints Discussed in the Text.” 185. (Includes a useful column on “Signature” on pictures.)</p>
                  <p>Anon. “Appendix 4: Large Colour Prints—Analytical Results.” 186. (It indicates that, inter alia, “Indigo in Green” was never used here.)</p>

                  <p>The writers and artists are William Blake and D. H. Lawrence; the “Blake district” is in Nottinghamshire (Blake’s mother in Walkeringham and Lawrence in Eastwood nearby), and the connection is the discovery that Blake’s mother was born in Walkeringham (pop. 419 in 1801) and composed [i.e., transcribed] a hymn, still extant, when applying to join the Moravian Church.</p>

Bentley, Jr., “The Journeyman and the Genius: James Parker and His Partner William Blake . . .,” <hi rend="i">Studies in Bibliography</hi> 49 (1996): 210 says that on 17 Aug. 1782 James Parker (aged 25 and up [the engraver was 25 then]), Stationer of the Parish of St. Dunstan in the West, contracted to marry Ann Serjeantson in the County of York. As Keri Davies points out to me, this is probably not James Parker, engraver, of the Stationers’ Company, but the James Parker, stationer, of 36, Chancery Lane in 1782-97 (see Ian Maxted, <hi rend="i">The London Book Trades 1775-1800</hi> [Folkestone: William Dawson &amp; Sons Ltd, 1977] 170).</note></p>

                  <p>In an undated letter to George Cumberland, Charles Henry Bellenden Ker wrote that his commission to Blake for two drawings, for which Ker did not wish to pay, was given “2 years ago” when he “was not of age.” As Ker was christened on 18 February 1787 (according to the entry in the <hi rend="i">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</hi> [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004] 31: 379), the commission was presumably given in late 1807 or very early 1808 when he came of age, and the present letter may be of 1809 or 1810.</p>

                  <p>On 25 November 1825 (the postmark date), Blake wrote to John Linnell (see cover illus. for <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 39.1 [2005]):
<q>
Dear Sir<lb/>
M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Banes says his Kitchen is at our Service to do as we please. I should like to know from the Printer whether our own Kitchen would not be equally or even more convenient as the Press being already there would Save a good deal of time &amp; trouble in taking down &amp; putting up which is no slight job. Also the light is better in our Kitchen if there is but room enough.<lb/>
I am yours Sincerely<lb/>

                  <p>Henry Banes, the husband of Catherine Blake’s sister Sarah, was the owner of 3, Fountain Court, where Blake lived in 1821-27, and Banes may well have lived in the same building.</p>

February 1826 Mary Ann Linnell wrote to her husband about “the Job . . . from all I can learn the printing is going on well [at Lahee’s shop] by a man of the name of Freeman.” The work was published in March 1826.</p>
                  <p>P. 495</p>
                  <p>The date of Frederick Tatham’s letter offering Blake’s works for sale is 11 April 1829, as in <hi rend="i">Blake Records Supplement</hi> (1988) 90, not 1 April.</p>

                  <p>“Blake preferred mixing his colours with carpenter’s glue, to gum”<ref target="n50" type="note">2</ref><note id="n50">2. The phrase is echoed by Tatham (671), but the scientific “analysis of Blake’s tempera paints . . . revealed the consistent presence of a mixture of gums Arabic (or karaya) and tragacanth with the additions of sugar or honey, and occasionally cherry gum” (Bronwyn Ormsby, Joyce H. Townsend, Brian Singer, and John Dean, “Blake’s Use of Tempera in Context,” <hi rend="i">William Blake: The Painter at Work</hi>, ed. Joyce H. Townsend [2003] 138).</note></p>

                  <p>Add: The “Plate to the Value of 60 Pounds” can scarcely be silver or gold, for the modest Blakes could not afford or wish such things; it was probably copper, Blake’s stock in trade. The copper cannot be his own works in illuminated printing, for these would have cost only about £21 (calculating the price of copper as 1<hi rend="i">d</hi> for a cubic cm., the price of his plates for Flaxman’s <hi rend="i">Naval Pillar</hi> [1799]—see p. 759—and the thickness of the copper as 0.141 cm., as in his fragmentary surviving copperplate from <hi rend="i">America</hi> pl. a), and besides many of them were printed after his death. But the cost of Blake’s 43 large copperplates for Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> (1797) would have been sixty guineas (assuming the plates were 0.183 cm. thick, as in Blake’s Dante plates of the same size). Probably the thieves took the 207 pounds of copperplates for Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts.</hi></p>

            <title>Blake’s Four . . . “Zoa’s”?</title>
          </head>
          <byline>By <docAuthor>Justin <name>Van Kleeck</name></docAuthor></byline>
          <p>Every word and every letter is studied and put into its fit place<br/> William Blake, <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, plate 3</p>
          <p>The manuscript of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> is famous in Blake studies for its complexity, difficulty, and manifold challenges to traditional approaches to texts, as well as for its richness of interpretive possibilities.<ref target="n0" type="note">*</ref> Whether one chooses to focus on the text, on the illustrations, or on the two together, those large folio and several smaller leaves require serious decisions for readers, scholars, bibliographers, and editors. And this is true in all its dimensions, from the highest organizational level—those two pesky Nights the Seventh; the second Night that is not quite “Night the Second”—progressively downward to the minute particulars—the multiple transpositions and additions; the status of those circled passages on pp. 5, 6, and 7; the many notes not by Blake.<note id="n0">*I would like to thank Robert N. Essick for his helpful comments on this essay and Morris Eaves—who may still be reeling from my two-day crash course on the manuscript—for his encouragement.</note></p>
          <p>I recount all of these well-known data to put in relief an extremely minute particular that appears to have gone largely unnoticed in editorial and critical treatments of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> While preparing a transcription of the manuscript for part of my dissertation and a new electronic edition,<ref target="n58" type="note">1</ref> I noticed the presence of an apostrophe between the “a” and “s” of “Zoas” on the title page (see illus. 1 and 2), which is one of Blake’s late revisions to the poem written in pencil above the cancelled original title “VALA”.<ref target="n59" type="note">2</ref> My reaction was first surprise, then confusion. In my years of studying the poem closely in its many printed and then facsimile forms, I had never noticed, nor been directed to, the presence of this curious mark on the very first page of the manuscript. Indeed, despite many differing opinions about the title—the manuscript’s very (disturbed) identity, as it were—I could not recall having heard any mention of Blake’s “Zoa’s”. Thus, what follows is an attempt to fill in what I believe to be a hole in treatments of the manuscript to date. <note id="n58">1. My dissertation project is an editorial history of the <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi> manuscript currently underway at the University of Virginia; the textual transcription was originally for the dissertation but now will be part of the <hi rend="i">William Blake Archive</hi> at some time in the future. I based my original transcription on the facsimiles by Bentley (1963) and Magno and Erdman (1987), as well as on a microfilm from the British Library, and then I consulted the manuscript itself from 7 to 11 March 2005. I am grateful to the entire staff of the British Library Department of Western Manuscripts for granting me access to this “Z Safe Restricted” artifact, as well as for their helpfulness and kindness during my visit (including lugging the bound manuscript back and forth to the safe for me!).</note><note id="n59">2. G. E. Bentley, Jr., dates the revision of the title page to “perhaps 1807” (<hi rend="i">Vala or The Four Zoas</hi> 165) and thus late in the long process of Blake’s engagement with the manuscript, which probably began sometime around “1797” as written on the title page.</note></p>
          <p>The history of the title is an interesting facet of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, which I offer here in brief to help explain part of my surprise and confusion. The first public acknowledgment of the manuscript is William Michael Rossetti’s catalogue in Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake.</hi> The catalogue entry in List 2 (“Uncoloured Works”), no. 7, gives the title as “Vala, or the Death and Judgment of the Ancient Man: a Dream of Nine Nights; by William Blake” (Gilchrist 2: 240). The pencil addition is not mentioned and the cancellations are ignored (the spelling of “Judgement” is also changed, but that by the by). E. J. Ellis and W. B. Yeats, the first to edit and publish the manuscript’s text for their <hi rend="i">The Works of William Blake</hi> (1893), take a similar approach to the title. Certainly, they played a crucial part in determining the shape of the poem as it appears today—reordering the manuscript’s disarrayed pages, making sense of transpositions and revisions, editing (and altering) the text for publication. The pencil notes by Ellis and others reveal their struggle with the material as they found it, which they describe in “About ‘Vala’” (2: 295-301). For them, the poem is without doubt “VALA”, for here they explain how after Blake initially gave it this title,
<q>
Another title was considered as better suited to the poem and was written higher up on the page. It was to have been called<lb/>
THE FOUR ZOAS<lb/>
Or<lb/>
The Torments of Love and Jealousy. (2: 296)
</q>
But according to them, Blake reconsidered, and “VALA” “was boldly repenned as the true title, and repeated as the heading of the poem’s first page” (2: 297).</p>
          <p>Despite Ellis and Yeats’s argument, and their publication of the poem as “VALA” (and their later republications of portions of that text in individual editions), John Sampson published brief selections from “<hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>” in his 1905 edition, <hi rend="i">The Poetical Works of William Blake</hi> (see 345). In his 1913 edition, along with providing fuller selections and a reproduction of the manuscript’s title page (facing 348), he transcribes the first part of the title in his bibliographical introduction as “‘The Four Zoas’” (xxxix). Subsequent to Sampson’s use of this title, in 1918 the manuscript was entered in the British Museum’s catalogue as “The Four Zoas”, Add. 39764, after being auctioned at Christie’s on 15 March and then donated anonymously to the Museum on 11 May of that year.<ref target="n60" type="note">3</ref><pb id="p39-40" n="40"/>
Geoffrey Keynes, too, transcribes the title (in its “<hi rend="i">second form</hi>”) as “The Four Zoas” in his <hi rend="i">A Bibliography of William Blake</hi> (1921). Here, Keynes begins what has been a common editorial and critical approach to the title, listing <hi rend="i">both</hi> forms: “VALA, <hi rend="i">or</hi>: THE FOUR ZOAS” (32). He would go on to follow this same practice in his later critical editions of Blake (1925, 1927, 1957, 1966 ff.) <note id="n60">3. The auction catalogue gives the title of the manuscript, Lot 206, as “VALA: or, The Death and Judgment of the Ancient Man: A Dream of Nine Nights; by William Blake, 1797” (28). The description, however, notes that “The Title was altered by Blake (in pencil) to The Four Zoas” and then refers to Sampson’s use of that title in his 1905 edition. The manuscript was sold to “Parsons” for £420.</note></p>
          <p>It is only with D. J. Sloss and J. P. R. Wallis’s <hi rend="i">The Prophetic Writings of William Blake</hi> in 1926 that we find the title transcribed as “‘The Four Zoa’s’” in their bibliographical preface to the poem (2: 136). Nonetheless, they did not make a particular note about the presence of the apostrophe, nor did they give the poem that title (or explain their choice) in their edition—it is still “<hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>”. In subsequent full editions of the text, no later editors have noted that there is <hi rend="i">something</hi> between that “a” and “s”, despite growing attention to the material manuscript and despite literal transcriptions of at least the title and a discussion of the revision: H. M. Margoliouth in <hi rend="i">William Blake’s</hi> Vala (1956) xiv; G. E. Bentley, Jr., in <hi rend="i">Vala or The Four Zoas</hi> (1963) 1 and see also 165, <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (1977) 457, and <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Writings</hi> (1978) 1072 and 1725; David V. Erdman in <hi rend="i">The Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi> (1965) 738 and <hi rend="i">The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi> (newly rev. ed. 1988) 817; W. H. Stevenson in <hi rend="i">Blake: The Complete Poems</hi> (2nd ed. 1989) 292; Alicia Ostriker in <hi rend="i">William Blake: The Complete Poems</hi> (rpt. 1981) 273 and 921-22. So too have editors of other types of editions consistently published the poem as <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> without a discussion of the apparent apostrophe in the title. Landon Dowdey gives a prose rendering and an eclectically Blakean visual re-presentation of the manuscript in his <hi rend="i">The FOUR ZOAS</hi> (1983), discussing the title in appendix B (3). In their facsimile The Four Zoas <hi rend="i">by William Blake</hi> (1987), Cettina Magno and David Erdman do not transcribe the text but do comment on the title page and the revision (25-26).<ref target="n61" type="note">4</ref><note id="n61">4. In <hi rend="i">The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</hi> (1981), Martin Butlin also transcribes the first line of the revised title as “The Four Zoas” (1: 275); he reproduces the title page in vol. 2, no. 430.</note></p>
          <p>All of these editors, it must be emphasized, have made valuable contributions to Blake studies, and some have also played significant roles in the fields of editing and bibliography. But the texts we receive in editions largely determine the interpretations of those texts, by the editors themselves and by others, and thus critical discussion of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> also has not acknowledged the possible apostrophe, despite growing attention to the network of revisions and ambiguities in the text. For example, the Santa Cruz Blake Study Group made both punctuation in general and <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> in particular key parts of their criticism of Erdman’s 1982 edition when reviewing it in 1984. Meanwhile, David M. Baulch, exploring the “multiple plurality” of the manuscript and the advantages of hypertext, begins by zeroing in on the word “zoas,” its implications for “many sets of four zoas,” and the challenges posed to editors, yet he does not mention the richly ambiguous mark in the new title (154). These are just two of the many important articles devoted to the textual state(s) of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, whether as a whole or in part.<ref target="n62" type="note">5</ref><note id="n62">5. For example, <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> has devoted several issues entirely or in large part to <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> (see my bibliography).</note></p>
          <p>The number of recent monographs on <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> is even more encouraging in many ways, since most of them make the revisionary and unbounded complexity of the manuscript a central part of their interpretations. Donald Ault’s <hi rend="i">Narrative Unbound</hi> (1987) is probably the most extreme example, “the first minutely detailed interpretation of the verbal text,” yet he transcribes the title as “‘THE FOUR ZOAS’” (xii). More significantly, he moves on to discuss the “heterogeneity” of the poem and states, “Perhaps the most immediately visible mark of this self-differing of the text . . . is in Blake’s revision of the poem’s title”—without drawing attention to one particular <hi rend="i">mark</hi> in that revision (xiii). George Anthony Rosso, Jr., (<hi rend="i">Blake’s Prophetic Workshop</hi> [1993] 165) and Andrew Lincoln (<hi rend="i">Spiritual History</hi> [1995] 32, including a transcription of the original title) both discuss the revision to the title. John B. Pierce gives a reproduction of the title page and explains how “The title changes are easily visible, even the rather tentative addition of ‘The Four Zoas’” (<hi rend="i">Flexible Design</hi> [1998] xxix; see also xix and 65-66). Peter Otto (<hi rend="i">Blake’s Critique of Transcendence</hi> [2000]), while paying careful attention to the manuscript and the revisions, focuses on the title page in his interpretation of the poem’s trapped circularity without actually transcribing the revised title (3, 342-46).</p>
          <p>Perhaps the first question we might ask in this context is, what exactly is this mark? As described above, an apostrophe shows up as part of the title only in Sloss and Wallis’s prefatory transcription, but they offer neither an explanation of why their actual title is given without it nor a discussion of what it is or could be. Now, looking at the title page as reproduced in both Bentley’s and Magno and Erdman’s facsimile editions, which are the means by which most readers will view the manuscript, it is evident that the mark is placed where one would normally expect to find an apostrophe. Further, it does not appear to be part of, nor in any feasible way related to, the pencil sketch just above it, and it is unlike the various random marks scattered across the page. (All of this is also true in the reproductions of the page in Sampson’s 1913 edition and in Pierce’s 1998 critical work.) At first glance, then, I interpreted it as an apostrophe. And yet at the same time, we can see in all of these reproductions that the mark is distinctly darker than the added pencil line.<ref target="n63" type="note">6</ref> But facsimiles can tell only so much, of
<pb id="p39-41" n="41"/>

</figure>
course, and often what they tell is different from the original tale. In the manuscript itself, the mark is almost certainly in pencil, as the color and the slight granulation (characteristic more of pencil than of ink writing) suggest. It is quite clearly darker than the pencil writing below it, but its placement makes it very hard when scanning the line—or even simply looking at the page—to deny the strong possibility, if not the likelihood, that it is an intentional apostrophe. <note id="n63">6. In this instance, Magno and Erdman’s infrared photography actually conceals more than it reveals, darkening the pencil marks on the page so that distinguishing tone is difficult; still, the difference between the title and this particular mark is somewhat perceptible. Bentley’s, Sampson’s, and Pierce’s reproductions show the difference much more starkly.</note></p>
          <p>Even if we agree that this is an apostrophe rather than an accidental accidental, the issue of intention raises a second and far more difficult question: is this mark (and the intention) Blake’s? The history of the manuscript makes answering such a question more complex than it might be otherwise. As the presence of non-Blakean text on many pages testifies, such a miniscule scratch of the pencil could have been added by a number of individuals between the time the manuscript left Blake’s hands late in his life and the time when Sampson first reproduced the title page in 1913: John Linnell or someone in the Linnell family, Gilchrist or Rossetti, Ellis or Yeats, are all equally viable candidates.<ref target="n64" type="note">7</ref> The contrast between the mark and the text below it makes this possibility an important one. However, most instances of such non-authorial text are limited to page and line numbering or other editorial notes, and the unknown censor of the illustrations seems to have been largely concerned with visual bowdlerizing. Further, it would be quite odd if Ellis or Yeats or someone working with them had added the mark, since they transcribe that portion of the title <hi rend="i">without</hi> it.<ref target="n65" type="note">8</ref> Why try to pass something off as Blake’s and then neglect to include it in the transcription of Blake’s text? <note id="n64">7. The best example of inscriptions not by Blake are Ellis’s two notes at the top of p. 15, the first from 1891 and the second from 1904, regarding the placement of that leaf; the pencil note takes up a fair portion of the top margin and continues down into the right margin as well. Many other pencil notes by some unknown individual(s) occur on various pages—for instance, the pencil note “Beginning of / Night VII” in the middle of the left margin on p. 95 that is almost certainly not in Blake’s hand, or the small note “Ellis / p. 81” written just above it. These latter notes for page collations with the Ellis-Yeats text appear with great frequency throughout the manuscript, beginning in the top left corner of p. 5.</note><note id="n65">8. They also do not record any such alteration in their list of “Author’s and Editor’s Verbal Emendations,” nor do they describe it in their “Descriptive Notes” (3: 149-74).</note></p>
          <p>We can next try to rule out the individual who added the page number “1” in the right corner, also in pencil but lighter than the mark. This is surely not Blake’s notation, as Bentley argues in his discussion of the poem’s order and reorderings (<hi rend="i">Vala or The Four Zoas</hi> 197). But we can check the number against the mark using Sampson’s reproduction from 1913. In that image, the page number does not appear, which ostensibly suggests that it was added some time later. Looking more closely, however, it is also clear that Sampson’s reproduction is not of the <hi rend="i">full</hi> page, the image being cropped at least at the sides. So might not the page number simply be cut off? First, the “6” of “69” is almost fully visible in the lower right corner. I measured both the bottom of the “1” (which is the leftmost point of the number) and the left edge of the “6” in the manuscript, and I found that the first point is approximately 3.7 cm. from the right border of the page and the second is approximately 3.3 cm. from the border. Thus, at least <hi rend="i">some</hi> portion of the “1” should appear in Sampson’s reproduction if it had been there at the time; tilted cropping is possible but does not appear to have occurred, since the text and sketches are situated properly in relation to the image borders. Bentley’s account of the British Museum’s page numbering (after Keynes) adds to the likelihood that the number on the title page is indeed later than the possible apostrophe.<ref target="n66" type="note">9</ref> But even if we disregard entirely the “1” in relation to our current point of enquiry, the ambiguous mark <hi rend="i">is</hi> there in the 1913 reproduction, but Sampson does not comment on it. <note id="n66">9. Keynes’s <hi rend="i">Bibliography</hi> offers visual proof of the numbers added by the British Museum: his reproduction of manuscript p. 27 (in the current order), facing p. 34 of his work, shows that the “13” in the upper right did not have a line through it in 1921, nor was there a “14” written above and to the right.</note></p>
          <p>Much more important in thinking about the mark’s authority is the internal and external evidence of Blake’s characteristic use of an apostrophe for the plural form of “Zoa.” Blake adopted the Greek word <hi rend="i">zoa</hi>, already plural for <hi rend="i">zoon</hi>, as used by John in Revelation for the four “Living Creatures.” Whether or not Blake knew the number of the original, pluralizing <hi rend="i">zoa</hi> with -s is one way he anglicized the word and thus brought it under the domain of English grammar—a linguistic syncretism entirely suitable to Blake. In English, adding an apostrophe to form the simple plural of a word ending in
<pb id="p39-42" n="42"/>
a vowel was and is fairly common practice. Two examples of Blake’s use of the apostrophe for simple plural are “Eccho’s” in the line “Demons of Waves their watry Eccho’s woke!” on p. 13 of the manuscript (1. 23 in Bentley, <hi rend="i">Vala or The Four Zoas</hi> 16 and Erdman, <hi rend="i">Complete</hi> 308) and, more tellingly, the naming of the Zoas as “Life’s in Eternity” on p. 123 (1. 38 in Bentley, <hi rend="i">Vala or the Four Zoas</hi> 131 and Erdman, <hi rend="i">Complete</hi> 393).</p>
          <p>While the singular word “Zoa” and its plural form do not appear anywhere else in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, Blake did use the plural form of “Zoa” in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> Of course, Blake is famously inconsistent (or we might say liberated) in his grammar, and so there are instances of both “Zoa’s” and “Zoas” for the plural in these works. However, “Zoa’s” is the more frequent spelling, occurring twelve times, three in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (copy C, 20:19, 43:14, 45:8) and nine in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (copy E, 36:26, 36:32, 36:45, 41:27, 42:24, 58:48, 74:2, 74:5, 88:56); Blake used the latter form, without the apostrophe, only four times: once in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (copy C, 38:29) and three times in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (copy E, 59:14, 63:4, 74:53).<ref target="n67" type="note">10</ref> In purely quantitative terms, then, “Zoa’s” is the more common plural form of Blake’s neologism. Whatever the case may be with this specific instance of the word, the fact that he <hi rend="i">did</hi> use “Zoa’s”, and more often, is highly significant when judging the “accidental” nature of the mark.<ref target="n68" type="note">11</ref><note id="n67">10. My source for the plate images and line numbers for these copies of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> is the <hi rend="i">William Blake Archive</hi> (http://www.blakearchive.org), which presents copy-specific plate orders and numbers every individual line of text on a plate, including plate numbers (hence differences from printed editions). I also collated these readings against 300 dpi digital images of the corresponding plates in copies A and D of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and A and I of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> stored (unpublished) in the <hi rend="i">Blake Archive</hi> and found no variants (though the apostrophe in 36:45 of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> copy I printed very lightly); I would like to thank the editors of the <hi rend="i">Blake Archive</hi> for access to the images. Lastly, I checked these readings against Erdman’s <hi rend="i">Complete</hi>, with which they all agree, and Bentley’s <hi rend="i">Writings</hi>, with which they agree except that Bentley omits the apostrophe in his <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 36:25, 36:44, and 58:47 (my 36:26, 36:45, and 58:48)—though each has one in the copies cited here.</note><note id="n68">11. A more tantalizing option is that the apostrophe indicates a <hi rend="i">possessive</hi>: the work to follow is that of the Four Zoa (already plural), something along the lines of, say, Chapman’s Homer—the authors, after all, being in Eternity. This is doubtful, though, since Blake did not cancel “by William Blake 1797.”</note></p>
          <p>My concern with the exactness of the title of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> may seem to be making a proverbial molehill on the mountain of the manuscript. Nevertheless, I think that the history of this ambiguous mark in the title of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> raises two important, interrelated issues: the centrality of interpretation to editorial practice and the dependence of subsequent interpretations on the products of that practice. Obviously, editors to date have interpreted the mark as not being an intentional apostrophe by Blake and thus not significant enough to appear in the title. While one can respect these editorial judgments, the evidence that I have presented seems to call, if not for a change in the accepted title, then at least for a textual note in future editions discussing the physical mark as it appears to an editor, the possibility that it is indeed Blake’s apostrophe, and the bases for that editor’s ultimate decision. This is especially true given that scholars and readers largely depend on reproductions and printed texts in lieu of the original manuscript. There never may be a way to prove once and for all that Blake deliberately added this mark, but my hope is that editors will recognize the value that their explicit commentary would have for anyone suddenly seeing a world in this textual grain of sand.</p>

            <title>William Blake’s <hi rend="i">A Pastoral Figure</hi>: Some Newly Revealed Verso Sketches</title>
          </head>
          <byline>By <docAuthor>Robert N. <name>Essick</name></docAuthor></byline>
          <p>In December 1993 I acquired a leaf of pencil sketches by Blake titled <hi rend="i">A Pastoral Figure and Other Sketches</hi> (illus. 1).<ref target="n69" type="note">1</ref> The drawing was for many years in the collection of W. Graham Robertson and appeared as lot 74 (with 2 other works) in the legendary auction of his Blake collection at Christie’s in London, 22 July 1949. After passing through the hands of at least two dealers, the sheet of studies was acquired by the American librarian and bibliographer Edwin Wolf 2<hi rend="s">nd</hi>. After his death in 1991, the drawing was inherited by one of his sons, who placed it for sale with the dealer Nicholas W. Lott, from whom I purchased the leaf. Lott told me that he had removed the badly stained drawing from its old, acidic mat and found more pencil sketches on the verso. Several of these were almost invisible before I cleaned the leaf. The purpose of this brief essay is to reproduce the heretofore unpublished verso sketches (illus. 2), describe them, and suggest some ways they can be situated within Blake’s career as an artist and poet. <note id="n69">1. Number 81, recto only, in Martin Butlin, <hi rend="i">The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</hi> (New Haven: Yale UP, 1981), hereafter cited as “Butlin” followed by entry number. Butlin describes the paper as “grey,” but cleaning the sheet revealed it to be a typical off-white eighteenth-century paper.</note></p>
          <p>The recto drawings, to which the verso sketches are related, are dominated by a young male seated under a tree. A wavy line below his feet might be the bank of a stream; behind the man and to the right is a distant mountain. He appears to be nude except for a cloak visible below and to the left of his right elbow, a line at his left wrist that suggests a cuff, and the gently curving lines defining his left upper-arm that hint at a cloth sleeve. The diagonal line across his chest may be a string holding the cloak. His posture, with his left hand raised to his face, vaguely hints at one of the traditional <hi rend="i">pathos formulae</hi> for melancholy. However, a loop about 1 cm. above this hand, and the shape of the hand itself, suggest that there may be something—possibly a staff with a knob at its upper termination—held in his left hand. All but the top of the staff is either left unexecuted or hidden behind the man. The most significant object, however, is the light outline of a lyre held by the figure’s right hand and extending between his legs. He is not only a “pastoral figure,” as the title indicates, but a musician/poet. Five versions of this figure, one of whom is clearly holding a staff, appear on the verso of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job, His Wife and His Friends: The Complaint of Job</hi>, since 1940 in the Tate Collection (Butlin #162 verso, dated to c. 1785). Four of these figures, like the main figure on the recto of <hi rend="i">A Pastoral Figure and Other Sketches</hi>, appear to be nude or only partly clothed. The largest figure, however, bears an arc below his neck that indicates a shirt or gown. Blake was clearly interested in developing the representation of a pastoral lyricist in the mid-1780s.</p>
          <p>The remaining figures on the recto include two versions of a recumbent male, perhaps wearing a brimless hat, sideways along the right margin; a third version of this same figure, sideways near the left margin; and two standing figures (the lower barely indicated), sideways above the bottom margin. The most interesting of the smaller sketches is once again a seated figure, upside down just above the bottom margin. He holds a large, triangular harp of the sort associated with the bard, not the lyric poet.</p>
          <p>Several of the previously unpublished verso sketches (illus. 2) continue themes and types known from the recto. All the verso drawings were probably executed at about the same time as the recto images, in the early- to mid-1780s.<ref target="n70" type="note">2</ref> Of the three largest figures, the one on the left would appear to be a side view of the pastoral figure dominating the recto. He sits under a tree and may be holding a lyre on his lap. The lightly sketched lines inhibit a clear identification of other features. The next, more darkly drawn figure to the right is gowned. The wide strap extending diagonally across his chest and left hip recalls the slenderer string over the chest of the major figure on the recto. He holds two objects, possibly the upper reaches of a triangular harp in the right hand and a staff in the left. The rightmost major figure is a further development of the central standing figure. He is similarly gowned, wears a cape that extends below the back of his legs, and now holds the large harp in both hands. He is probably playing the instrument. Some lightly drawn vertical lines right of his left shoulder may be the trunks of trees or the columns of a portico; a wavy line below his feet and three verticals right of his left leg also hint at a landscape. <note id="n70">2. I suspect that Butlin’s dating of the recto to c. 1785 represents the upper end of the date range.</note></p>
          <p>The smaller verso designs include a standing figure drawn sideways upper right, perhaps a female wearing a wimple or hood and possibly holding, and looking down toward, a child in her right arm; a standing figure among trees lower right, with an outline frame drawn around the composition; and three very sketchy figures drawn sideways lower left. The hooded figure may be a further development of the fullfrontal standing figure drawn sideways in the lower half of the recto.</p>
          <p>Motifs evocative of the lyric/pastoral on the one hand, and the bardic/epic on the other, are the most significant images on both recto and verso. The former recalls the classical inheritance of eighteenth-century poetry. The latter might suggest the Homeric epic, but the decidedly non-Greek shape of the harp implies a nativist British tradition harkening back to the Welsh bards and Ossian.<ref target="n71" type="note">3</ref> These two genres and their

attendant cultural associations also resonate through Blake’s earliest poems, published as <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> in 1783. He laments the attenuated state of both traditions. “The shepherd leaves his mellow pipe” in “Gwin, King of Norway,” while “the languid strings do scarcely move” for the “bards of old” in “To the Muses.”<ref target="n72" type="note">4</ref> Here and elsewhere in Blake’s poems and designs, the shepherd’s pipe is a more common motif than the lyre, but carries much the same meaning. The specifically British associations of the harp are indicated in “A War Song to Englishmen,” in which King “Alfred shall smile, and make his harp rejoice” (E 440). <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>, etched and first printed in 1789, also indicates the complementary differences between pastoral musician and bard. The “Introduction” to the anthology (E 7), coupled with the frontispiece directly illustrating that poem, announces a revivified lyricism, while “The Voice of the Ancient Bard” (E 31-32) reaches toward an epic vision that encompasses experience as well as innocence.<ref target="n73" type="note">5</ref> In the design above the text, the bard strums a triangular harp even larger than the one played by his younger counterpart in the verso sketch (illus. 2). Poised chronologically between <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> and <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi>, the drawings reproduced here show Blake experimenting with visual representations of the two poetical modes, and the states of consciousness they embody, in which he worked throughout most of his career. <note id="n71">3. John Flaxman’s first outline design to the <hi rend="i">Iliad</hi> pictures the Greek harp, or <hi rend="i">cithara</hi>, traditionally associated with classical epic. See <hi rend="i">The Iliad of Homer Engraved by Thomas Piroli from the Compositions of John Flaxman Sculptor</hi> (Rome: [Piroli], 1793). For some of Blake’s major pictures of the large triangular Celtic or Welsh harp, see his illustrations to Thomas Gray’s “The Bard” (Butlin #335.53) and “The Triumphs of Owen” (Butlin #335.89), and the tempera painting and recto/verso drawings of <hi rend="i">The Bard, from Gray</hi> (Butlin #655-56). Homer holds a large lyre in Blake’s first design to Gray’s “The Progress of Poesy” (Butlin #335.41). In Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, the Celtic harp became a symbol of national independence in the late eighteenth century; see Katie Trumpener, <hi rend="i">Bardic Nationalism</hi> (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1997) 3-34.

            <title>“Great and Singular Genius”: Further References to Blake (and Cromek) in the <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine</hi></title>

          <p>The generous review of “<hi rend="i">Blake’s</hi> Illustrations of <hi rend="i">Blair’s</hi> Grave” in the <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine</hi> of November 1808 has been known for some time.<ref target="n74" type="note">1</ref> No critic, however, has yet noted the existence of two short anonymous notices, earlier in the same magazine, which paved the way for the volume’s reception in Edinburgh. The first, in July 1807, appeared as the first of three paragraphs in the “Scottish Literary Intelligence” column. It announces the forthcoming Blake-Blair volume and describes an exhibition, organized by the book’s publisher Robert Cromek, in St. James’s Square in Edinburgh. The exhibition featured Blake’s original paintings for Robert Blair’s poem <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, as well as a painting to illustrate <hi rend="i">The Canterbury Tales</hi>:
<q>
A Splendid Edition of Blair’s Grave is about to be published, illustrated with paintings by Mr Blake, an artist and poet of great and singular genius. These paintings are now exhibiting in James’s Square No. 9. by Mr Cromek, a very ingenious young artist, who proposes to engrave them for the abovementioned work, for which he is now taking in subscriptions. A beautiful painting of the procession of Chaucer’s pilgrims is exhibited at the same time, and Mr Cromek is also taking in subscriptions for an engraving which is to be made from it.<ref target="n75" type="note">2</ref><note id="n74">1. The review is reprinted in my note “Blake, <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, and Edinburgh Literary Society,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 24.1 (summer 1990): 35-36.</note><note id="n75">2. Anon., “Scottish Literary Intelligence,” <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine, and Edinburgh Literary Miscellany</hi> 69 (1807): 522.</note></q>
The “paintings” by Blake here were presumably the set of nineteen watercolors which have recently come to light, in what has been described as “the most exciting Blake discovery” in many decades, “and arguably the most important since Blake began to be appreciated in the second half of the nineteenth century.”<ref target="n76" type="note">3</ref> Evidently at this time in 1807, Cromek was planning to engrave Blake’s designs himself. It is unclear whether the painting of “Chaucer’s pilgrims” is the well-known one by Thomas Stothard, commissioned by Cromek and finished in
<pb id="p39-48" n="48"/>
1807, or the watercolor which Blake completed at about the same time, and which was also commissioned by Cromek.<ref target="n77" type="note">4</ref><note id="n76">3. Martin Butlin, “New Risen from the Grave: Nineteen Unknown Watercolors by William Blake,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 35.3 (winter 2002-03): 68-73 (68). The paintings apparently remained in Edinburgh after the exhibition, and were sold to a Scottish collector in 1836. See also G. E. Bentley, Jr., “Thomas Sivright and the Lost Designs for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 19.3 (winter 1985-86): 103-06.</note><note id="n77">4. For Stothard’s and Blake’s rival illustrations to Chaucer, see Peter Ackroyd, <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> (London: Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995) 271-72, and G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1969) 209, 216-17. Blake exhibited his own painting for Chaucer’s <hi rend="i">Canterbury Tales</hi> in London in May 1809.</note></p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Cromek’s reputation in Edinburgh continued to grow as a result of his lucrative researches into Scottish poetry. The December <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine</hi> announced that “An interesting literary discovery of unpublished works of the late Robert Burns, has been made by Mr Cromer [sic], in a late tour through Scotland.” Many Scots readers would have been stirred by this glowing account of newfound poems and letters by Burns being “rescued from oblivion” by Cromek.<ref target="n78" type="note">5</ref> Coming so soon before the Blake-Blair volume, this advance publicity for Cromek’s edition of <hi rend="i">Reliques of Burns</hi> probably contributed to the success of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, with Blake’s designs, in Edinburgh. <note id="n78">5. Anon., “Scottish Literary Intelligence,” <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine</hi> 69 (1807): 925.</note></p>
          <p>No mention of Blake appeared in the <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine</hi> between July 1807 and September 1808. But in that month, the magazine noted the actual publication of Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> and its engravings by Luigi Schiavonetti based on Blake’s paintings. This briefer notice gives the size of the volume and its price of two pounds, twelve shillings and sixpence: “Illustrations of Blair’s Grave, in 12 Etchings, executed by Louis Schiavonetti, from the Original Inventions of William Blake, 4to. 2<hi rend="i">l.</hi> 12s. 6d.”<ref target="n79" type="note">6</ref> The long review of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, praising Blake for his “genius” and “beautiful” though “eccentric” designs, followed quickly in November.<ref target="n80" type="note">7</ref><note id="n79">6. Anon., <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine</hi> 70 (1808): 683. The notice is the second of three paragraphs in the “New Works Published in Edinburgh” section for September 1808.</note><note id="n80">7. <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine</hi> 70 (1808): 839-40.</note></p>
          <p>There appear to be no further citations of Blake in the <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine.</hi><ref target="n81" type="note">8</ref> But in December 1808, its readers were told that Cromek’s long-awaited work on Burns was now in print: “Reliques of Robert Burns: consisting chiefly of original Letters, Poems, and Critical Observations on Scottish Songs. Collected and published by R.H. Cromek. 8vo. 10s. 6d.”<ref target="n82" type="note">9</ref> Long extracts from the <hi rend="i">Reliques of Burns</hi> followed in January 1809, and a laudatory review in March.<ref target="n83" type="note">10</ref> Then, in August 1809, the same journal announced that “Mr Cromek is receiving subscriptions for an Historical Portrait of Mr Walter Scott, from the admired Picture by [Henry] Raeburn, which appeared at the last Exibition [sic] of Scottish paintings.”<ref target="n84" type="note">11</ref><note id="n81">8. The <hi rend="i">Scots</hi> continued publishing until the end of 1826. One article of some interest (as it mentions a few of Blake’s fellow engravers) is the anonymous “Account of a Society Formed for the Encouragement of the Art of Engraving” (72 [August 1810]: 590-92).</note><note id="n82">9. Anon., “New Works Published in Edinburgh,” <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine</hi> 70 (1808): 923. The identical notice (with a few changes in capitalization) appeared in the same column for January 1809 (71: 46).</note><note id="n83">

The appearance of these articles, coming so soon after the same journal’s review of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, would have given Cromek quite a high profile among Scottish readers.
                            <p>No critic has noted that Cromek was probably of Scots descent (though born in England). Each of his five volumes was Scottish in some way, and his unusual surname is remarkably close to the Scottish Gaelic words “crom,” “cromack,” or “cromag,” which mean “anything twisted or bent, particularly fingers” (Blake would have enjoyed that!). “Cromack” is also a variant spelling of the Gaelic word “crummock,” meaning “a cow with twisted horns” (see the <hi rend="i">Scottish National Dictionary</hi>, 1952 edition, III: 251-52 and 267).</p></note><note id="n84">11.

          <p>Around 1810, Cromek’s reputation in Scottish circles began to wane. Perhaps this was due in part to Walter Scott’s influence, for Scott told one publisher that “Cromek is a perfect Brain-sucker living upon the labours of others.”<ref target="n85" type="note">12</ref> Cromek’s two-volume <hi rend="i">Select Scotish Songs</hi>, published in 1810, received neither review nor notice of any kind in the <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine.</hi> When his final book, <hi rend="i">Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song</hi>, came out in 1811, a polite but lukewarm review commended Cromek’s “copious” notes and “good deal of valuable information” on the subjects of “witchcraft” and “fairies.”<ref target="n86" type="note">13</ref> Cromek’s death in 1812 passed unnoticed in the <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine.</hi><note id="n85">12.

The <hi rend="i">Nithsdale</hi> volume has some relevance to Blake, because many of its supposed folk songs were in fact by Allan Cunningham, who later wrote the well-known chapter on Blake in his <hi rend="i">Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters.</hi> The imposture was detected by James Hogg, but Hogg was unable to find a publisher for his review on the subject; Hogg’s review, alas, has never been traced, although he says he kept the manuscript until at least 1832 (see his <hi rend="i">“Memoir of the Author’s Life” and “Familiar Anecdotes of Sir Walter Scott,”</hi> ed.

          <p>Blake’s <hi rend="i">Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> contains a section entitled Proverbs of Hell. This section, like the work as a whole, contains sharp satiric, even parodic, elements directed against the Bible, Blake’s devotion to Scripture notwithstanding.
<pb id="p39-49" n="49"/>
One of the proverbs therein is “The nakedness of woman is the work of God.”<ref target="n87" type="note">1</ref> Strangely, as far as I know, no one has noted the sharp—one might say polemical—relationship of this aphorism to a famous passage in Paul’s first Letter to the Corinthians: “Every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head; for that is even all one as if she were shaven. For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn; but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god: but the woman is the glory of the man” (11:5-7).<ref target="n88" type="note">2</ref> “The woman is the glory of the man.” Paul’s aphoristic structure is kept by Blake: “The nakedness of woman is the work of God.”<ref target="n89" type="note">3</ref> Paul’s injunction that women need to keep their hair covered is countered by Blake’s overriding praise of the naked woman. While Paul condemns the baring of a woman’s head, Blake lauds her presence with no coverings at all. This rejection of Paul is another example of what Bloom calls “Blake’s Proverbs exist[ing] to break down orthodox categories of thought and morality.”<ref target="n90" type="note">4</ref><note id="n87">1.

          <p>Joyce H. Townsend’s handsome collection of colorfully illustrated studies and reports focuses on Blake’s paintings and large color prints<ref target="n91" type="note">1</ref> as physical objects, with emphasis on identifying his methods and materials, establishing what the pictures originally looked like, and determining how they can now be preserved, restored and displayed. The technical information that dominates the book will be most directly useful to museum professionals, but the writers try to make the discussions accessible to Blakeans at large, whether art historians, literary scholars, artists, or interested amateurs. As one might expect, some of the essays exhibit the perturbations of voice and technical level that occur when multiple authors write collectively for a wide audience, but readers will have little trouble sorting out what is useful to them. All of the authors are affiliated in one way or another with the Tate, so the discussions concentrate on works in the incomparable Blake collection there, works recently exhibited there, and on pictures in or near London. As a result there are few definitive pronouncements here about what Blake always or never did—the contributors didn’t examine everything, and it’s clear from what they did study that his practices varied. All in all, the technical analyses are much more sophisticated than those that have previously been brought to bear on these questions, the results are more conclusive, the perspectives are refreshing and often startling, the discoveries are numerous, and the consequences are substantial for everyone who studies Blake’s art. <note id="n91">1. The large color prints are distinguished here from the color-printed pages in Blake’s illuminated books and books of designs, for most of which Blake probably used similar materials but some different procedures. Robert N. Essick and the painter/printmaker Caroline Adams corrected many errors in drafts of this review.</note></p>
          <p>Much of <hi rend="i">The Painter at Work</hi> is concerned with determining what the latest analytical, microscopic and imaging technologies can tell us about the procedures Blake used to create his watercolors, large color prints, and temperas, but among them the authors also bring to the discussion wide-ranging expertise in material culture, art history, and Blake studies, and in some cases they also have extensive personal experience with Blake works as physical objects: moving them, hanging
<pb id="p39-50" n="50"/>
them, storing them, lighting them, protecting them, cleaning and repairing them. Though many are specialists, the authors are not narrow-minded, and they consistently indicate how their information relates to some of the other ways of thinking about Blake’s work. Nevertheless, the new analytical and critical veins they have uncovered are hardly exhausted, and scholars still have plenty of room to apply the information recorded here to the longstanding puzzles on which they bear.</p>
          <p>One contributor who is especially adept at thinking simultaneously about Blake’s pictures as intellectual constructs and as material objects is consultant editor Robin Hamlyn, a senior curator at the Tate. His introductory essay, “William Blake at Work: ‘Every thing which is in Harmony,’” reflects not only deep knowledge of Blake’s work and its various cultural contexts, but also longstanding familiarity with the pictures as something other than intangible presences on a wall. Although most of the information he assembles comes from earlier scholarship rather than the technical analyses presented here, Hamlyn’s demystified perspective illuminates the practical and intellectual consequences of all kinds of pertinent physical realities, not just those of the objects themselves. When, for instance, he takes up the subject of “fresco,” a medium that Blake particularly respected but understood rather differently from the rest of the world, Hamlyn deftly connects the frescorelated technical features of Blake’s color prints and temperas, Raphael’s frescoes in the Vatican Loggia, the frescoes of Rigaud in the Guildhall, the “Venetian Secret” scandal of the midnineties, and Blake’s idea of “Portable Fresco.” And this brings up (here and in a later chapter he cowrote with Townsend and John Anderson) a particularly intangible work, the lost painting of <hi rend="i">The Ancient Britons</hi>; Hamlyn not only considers how the huge picture would have hung in Blake’s 1809 Exhibition but also how the short, stocky artist must have climbed on the furniture to paint it in the studio in South Molton Street, how little space he would have had for framing it (suggesting that he didn’t), and how he carried it to his brother’s house on Broad Street where the exhibition was held. This particular “Portable Fresco” must have been not only light enough to move but, as G. E. Bentley and others have noted, capable of being rolled up to carry across town, through narrow doors and passages, and up and down several flights of stairs. <hi rend="i">The Painter at Work</hi> also features two other general essays: the first is a mildly confusing multi-author review of “The State of Knowledge on William Blake the Painter,” summarizing a largely undifferentiated assortment of first-hand accounts, second-hand accounts, speculations of diverse vintage, and modern research reports. Joyce Townsend concludes the introduction by briskly describing the various analytical techniques used in the reports.</p>
          <p>The main body of the book is divided into sections on watercolors (works in relatively thin colors painted on paper without a ground—what Blake usually called drawings), large color prints (works printed in thick colors from a stiff surface onto paper and finished variously), and temperas (works painted in thick and thin colors on a white ground), each of which is further divided into chapters that address relevant subtopics. Blake himself did not explicitly classify his works this way: he experimented freely with materials and methods, and in practice and in rhetoric he often tried to shift or blur the traditional boundaries between art-making media. As a result, the sections of the book devoted to these topics often overlap, and because the chapters are the work of different authors, some information comes up twice. On the other hand, all the authors deliberately avoid the entire issue of “illuminated book” printing, especially printing pages in color. This decision is understandable, given the paucity of illuminated works at the Tate and the fierce debate about these processes in this journal and elsewhere, but also somewhat arbitrary, since most of Blake’s painting media are involved one way or another in the printing and finishing of illuminated books, and many of the elaborate arguments in that controversy bear directly on works covered in this book.</p>
          <p>The section on “Watercolours” is divided into Peter Bower’s essay, “The Vivid Surface,” on papers and stiffer paper-related materials (pasteboards, cardboards, millboards, etc.), and a discussion by Townsend and Noa Cahaner McManus of Blake’s “Watercolour Methods, and Materials Use in Context.” Bower distinguishes lucidly between the various kinds of paper and board that Blake used or is said to have used as support for the finished works or in the process of color printing, and provides information about watermarks and papermakers that will also be very useful for those studying Blake’s prints, illuminated books, and other works on paper from the period. McManus and Townsend show how Blake’s watercolor technique was related to those of contemporary masters of the emergent medium such as Girtin and Turner, and then how different from theirs his actual practice usually was, even though he used many of the same materials. Most watercolorists drew a subject in graphite, added layers of “neutral tint” (gray or light brown) to establish forms, and then washed over the result in weak colors, often after erasing the graphite completely. By contrast, Blake usually avoided neutral tints, preferring to define form through clearly drawn lines that emerged from clouds of erased pentimenti; over the outlines he added strong colors, and then reinforced the lines with ink.</p>
          <p>One generality is especially interesting: the authors note that Blake consistently favored additive procedures in his watercolors, eschewing such widely used techniques as color subtraction with sponge or cloth, scratching out or erasing (and though they don’t mention it, I haven’t seen evidence that he used the related technique of masking with impervious stencils to create patterns). McManus and Townsend suggest that subtractive techniques “might have seemed to him to be evidence of indecision or second thoughts” (66), and thus inconsistent with Blake’s aesthetic doctrines, which usually favor as much directness as possible between inspiration and execution. That principle may be relevant, but my limited experience as a watercolorist tells me that subtractive techniques are more likely to be part of the artist’s plan of execution than
<pb id="p39-51" n="51"/>
afterhoughts. And Blake was not at all averse to subtractive procedures in his other media: some of the temperas use them (see 124-25 in the book under review) and his various printing processes play freely with reversal, subtraction and addition, white-line and black-line, shadow and light, even while they preserve the directness of execution that Blake so prized. What we may be seeing here is not inconsistency but allegiance to what Blake saw as the inherent properties of a given kind of art-making—for him, watercolor as a medium appears to have been “colouring,” an essentially additive (and subordinate) adjunct to drawing, which alone defined form; by contrast, his printmaking was a medium of reversals, reiterations, second and third thoughts, inversions and ironies, additive subtractions and subtractive additions. Conversely, Blake’s watercolors rarely feature even additive forms of serendipitous trickery for achieving naturalistic effects, such as brush slapping or sputtering, in which “natural” random patterns are created mechanically. The watercolor manuals of the day were filled with recipes for such indirection, but Blake’s approach maximized linearity, direct intentionality, and transparency, both literal and figurative. Although a few of his early works employ something like conventional watercolor procedure (neutral tones added to faint preliminary drawing, followed by weak color tinting), almost all his hundreds of later watercolors emphasize expressive line, especially outline, and strong pure color rather than tone.</p>
          <p>Of all his techniques, Blake’s watercolor method seems calculated to contrast as much as possible with oil painting, which dominated all other media in the respectable art world, and which Blake detested on several different grounds. Many oil painters, then as now, used transparency and translucency to some degree in their work, but Blake always represented oil paint as essentially opaque, its colors murky, and its techniques disingenuous and indirect. Furthermore, both the vehicle and the pigment of oil colors seemed to him inherently unreliable in the long term. Blake was sure that oils would inevitably turn brown, and he knew that mixing oil colors on the palette, the usual practice when colors are nearly opaque, can bring together incompatible chemical compounds that eventually react with pernicious effect.</p>
          <p>The Tate researchers show that Blake’s watercolor techniques seem to have been aimed at promoting both transparency and durability, even if he was not always successful at achieving either of them. The finished work usually reveals the underlying drawing, in general it uses the light reflected off the underlying paper and through pigmented layers rather than off the surface of opaque colors, and he usually finished the work by confirming the initial graphite outlines in ink. Both the graphite drawing and the final confirmation of it were of paramount importance to Blake, and yet his technique was not restricted to the addition of transparent layers: both late and early in his career, Blake’s colors were often strong enough to be virtually opaque, and he sometimes added substances like chalk and (disastrously) white lead that rendered them even more so. To minimize adverse reactions he almost always kept his watercolor pigments themselves pure, and wisely used diluted ink for his grays rather than the popular compounded “neutral tints” of the day, many of which have faded. Unlike oil painters, Blake usually created mixed colors by applying a second color over the first after it had dried thoroughly, or added colors side by side in small touches with a dry brush (though he sometimes created greens by mixing blue and yellow on the palette or by washing one wet color over another while the first was still wet). One other significant pattern in the analysis of Blake’s watercolor pigments is that in general he seems to have chosen inexpensive pigments and avoided expensive ones. This could be an unsurprising consequence of Blake’s usual poverty, but given his experimental spirit and his willingness to use expensive papers and other deluxe materials, it may be better understood as an attempt to avoid unproven pigments or ones with prices that might encourage adulteration or misrepresentation.</p>
          <p>McManus and Townsend also address questions about the current state of Blake’s watercolors, many of which are not in good shape, especially those that have been exposed to light for any period of time. They explain which pigments have probably vanished and which have shifted in color, and show examples of various forms of deterioration and restoration. Thus a picture like <hi rend="i">The River of Life</hi> may once have featured a considerably bluer river and green lawns that have subsequently turned mottled gray and yellow, respectively, as fugitive blues vanished from too much exposure.<ref target="n92" type="note">2</ref> It is somewhat heartening that most of the widespread deterioration (and damage in “restoration”) occurred in the nineteenth century and has been slowed considerably for those works that are now in good hands. The Tate authors don’t address this issue directly, but if lost or altered colors can be mapped on Blake’s pictures reliably, digital recreations of their original appearance may be possible. <note id="n92">2. The authors propose a complex sequence of deterioration, restoration, and more deterioration to account for the current state of the blues in this picture.</note></p>
          <p>The chapter on the large color prints, also by McManus and Townsend, greatly clarifies Blake’s practice in this medium, in which he executed some of his most striking works. It shares characteristics with watercolor, tempera, and the color printing that Blake did in the illuminated books: like the watercolors and color-printed illuminated pages, Blake’s large color prints were executed on paper without a ground, and like the temperas and most color-printed books, they employ colors made by combining pigments (some of them outside his watercolor palette) with a thick water-based binder, usually a mixture of plant gums and sugar or honey, the Tate authors report.<ref target="n93" type="note">3</ref><pb id="p39-52" n="52"/>
Their tests show that the gums included gum arabic (from the acacia tree), gum tragacanth (from the shrub <hi rend="i">Astragalus gummifer</hi> or its close relative <hi rend="i">Astragalus verus</hi>), and possibly gum karaya (also called Indian tragacanth, from <hi rend="i">Sterculia urens</hi>). Gum arabic, the gum most widely used to bind ordinary watercolors, promotes even dispersion of pigments and is readily soluble and resoluble in water, but gum tragacanth (usually called gum dragon in Blake’s day but not to be confused with the reddish tree resin called dragon’s blood) is a thickener that dissolves best in warm water and is not easily resoluble once it has dried. The Tate authors list gum karaya as a possible component because gas chromatography cannot distinguish it from gum arabic when gum tragacanth is present, but they note that it wasn’t regularly imported in Blake’s day. It is a very potent thickener that might conceivably have been sold to Blake as gum tragacanth, but the gum karaya I have used is fairly resoluble in cool water, and would not have been a satisfactory substitute for tragacanth if Blake sought waterfastness as well as thickening. <note id="n93">3. Those interested in the large color prints should also consult Joseph Viscomi’s reports of his experiments with color printing from flat surfaces in Robert N. Essick and Viscomi, “Blake’s Method of Color Printing: Some Responses and Further Observations,” <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> 36.2 (fall 2002): 61-63 and Bo Ossian Lindberg’s observations in his review of Essick’s <hi rend="i">Printmaker</hi> in <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> 15.3 (winter 1981-82): 140-48.</note></p>
          <p>The presence of substantial amounts of gum tragacanth suggests that despite similarities to Blake’s watercolor palette, many of the colors used in color printing had a very different consistency from those used in the watercolors. The working characteristics of a paint bound with a mixture of arabic and tragacanth might have been roughly comparable to those of modern acrylics, which can be thick or thin and, though water-based, are waterproof when dry. Gum tragacanth was sometimes called “watercolor megilp” (or “McGuelp”),<ref target="n94" type="note">4</ref> reflecting its similarity to the mastic-based megilp used as a thickener in oil painting. (My experiments with various combinations of the thickening gums, however, suggest that unlike acrylics or oil megilp, which tend to retain their shape in impasto, thickened gum gels collapse almost completely to thin layers as the very high water content in them evaporates.) The reticulated patterns that appear in the colored prints indicate that for this purpose Blake’s colors were rendered gelatinously thick, largely by the gum tragacanth, with much more substance than his ordinary watercolors, though they could be diluted to the consistency of water.<ref target="n95" type="note">5</ref> Unlike Blake’s watercolor drawings, which are scrupulously deliberate, the large color prints often rely heavily on (and carefully preserve) the largely serendipitous patterning effects created by the thick colors as they pulled off the printing surface in blobs, sierras, and peaks that subsequently shrank down as they dried but did not lose relief entirely. The Tate authors cite D. G. Rossetti’s baffled awe when he examined these patterns in the color print <hi rend="i">Newton</hi>: “I can conceive no mechanical process short of photography which is really capable of explaining it” (43). Although most of these impressive reticulations were probably generated by the pritning process, we should be alert to the possibility that when finishing the large color prints he created additional patterning effects by means of the kind of paint manipulations (blotting, dabbing) that he rarely used in watercolor. Another significant difference from Blake’s watercolors is that although there may have been a preliminary drawing on the flat printing surface, it would not have transferred to the color print: the only visible drawing on a large color print is the final outlining in ink. <note id="n94">4. The <hi rend="i">OED</hi> lists the following variants: “Magelp, magelph, magilp, magylp, magylph, megilp, megelp, megylp, megylph, macgelp, macgelph, macgilp, macgilph, macgylph, macgulp, magulp, megulph, mygelp, mygelph, mygilp, mygilph, mygulp, mygulph,” Marjorie B. Cohn, in <hi rend="i">Wash and Gouache</hi> (Cambridge, MA: Fogg, 1977) 57, spells it “meglip.”</note><note id="n95">5. Some of Blake’s watercolors include gum tragacanth as a constituent in the binder, and it is possible that he used very dilute glue in this way as well.</note></p>
          <p>Once the printed colors of a large color print had dried thoroughly they would not easily “wash up” as colors bound by gum arabic do, because the tragacanth and/or related gums would inhibit it. The printing colors were often rendered nearly opaque by their thickness, pigment density and/or by the addition of lead white, chalk or other materials. If Blake wished to print a composite color he could not superimpose or delicately juxtapose its constituents as he could with watercolor, but had to mix them before (or after) applying them to the printing surface, though for some color combinations he could print an opaque constituent and wash a second transparent one over it after the first had dried.</p>
          <p>The large color prints were painted once onto a stiff flat surface, probably millboard,<ref target="n96" type="note">6</ref> and then two or at most three impressions of varying strength were taken from the wet painting onto dampened paper.<ref target="n97" type="note">7</ref> Once these impressions dried, the printed colors on them were supplemented with more water-based colors, thick and thin, opaque and transparent, as well as such materials as shell gold, gold leaf, India ink, printer’s ink, graphite and charcoal; as in Blake’s watercolors and temperas, finishing usually involved fixing outlines in ink with a pen or brush. Each print would be a little different from the others as colors were depleted (and weakened) or dampened (and rendered more transferable) by successive printings, and the finishing/outlining process would further differentiate the resulting prints from each other. Nevertheless, the printed areas themselves are so similar in distribution of color from impression to impression that there could have been no repainting of the millboard between taking them, which also explains why there are so few impressions of each. By contrast, for the color printing involved in illuminated books, most impressions involved reinking the text and relief elements of the design with printer’s ink and probably some replenishment of the surface areas that printed colors. To supplement their 
<pb id="p39-53" n="53"/>
general account of color printing, McManus and Townsend consider two specific large color prints, compare two versions of <hi rend="i">Satan Exulting over Eve</hi>, and finally Piers Townshend and Joyce Townsend offer a detailed account of the conservation of the Tate’s recently acquired copy of that print. <note id="n96">6. <hi rend="i">God Judging Adam</hi> was probably printed from copper etched in relief rather than a flat surface. Millboard was a smooth glueless unlaminated paperboard that was finished by milling between heavy rollers, according to Bower (56-57).</note><note id="n97">7. Viscomi and Essick suggest that Blake may have sealed the surface of the millboard with a layer of glue-based gesso to keep the paint from soaking in. See “Blake’s Method” 61. They also suggest that Blake’s process may have involved printing from a semidried image, which would be rehydrated by the dampness of the printing paper.</note></p>
          <p>The three chapters on tempera are cowritten by Bronwyn Ormsby, Brian Singer, and John Dean; Townsend joins them in the chapter placing these paintings in context. Blake designated many of his works in various media (even the large color prints) as “fresco,” a term that in its strictest sense refers to water-based colors applied to fresh damp plaster. Blake didn’t work on plaster, wet or dry, but the temperas discussed here were all executed in water-based colors on a gesso-like white ground—a foundational layer that, like plaster, reflects light through the colors above it and provides white areas of the picture—and of his works they are the most similar to what the rest of the world calls fresco.</p>
          <p>The Tate researchers establish that Blake’s ground consisted mostly of whiting, basically powdered chalk and other white substances such as lead white, bound with transparent animal glue (which was probably made by gently simmering glove clippings, parchment, or rabbit skin), along with a small amount of sugar or honey. This animal glue was water-based like Blake’s gum binders (these are also present sometimes in the ground), but it was much more fluid when warm than when cool, at least when undiluted (gum tragacanth requires heat to dissolve, but unless it is very thick it remains workable when cool). When animal glue cools, it quickly sets into a rubbery clear gelatin, and unlike the thickening gums it retains much of its substance when it hardens—it is also resoluble for some time after setting/drying, though less so than gum arabic.</p>
          <p>To create a tempera, Blake applied the glue/whiting mixture in layers to a support—paper, canvas, wood, copper, tinned steel or iron,<ref target="n98" type="note">8</ref> etc.—let that cool and harden, then executed the preliminary underdrawing in ink or paint on the resulting white surface as if it were paper, protected that layer with a layer of unpigmented glue, then painted on it using everything from gelatinously thick colors to thin washes, adding other materials similar to those used in finishing the color prints. The authors note that Blake probably laid the work flat for most stages in the process, thereby preventing runs and promoting the even dispersion of the pigments. <note id="n98">8. Used only in the Tate’s <hi rend="i">Agony in the Garden.</hi></note></p>
          <p>Those studying Blake’s temperas have often noted that the paint has multiple layers, and almost all reports assert that he used animal glue to paint his pictures, usually with the assumption that it served as a binder, as in distemper painting. One very important revelation in the Tate studies of Blake’s temperas is that he alternated layers of pigment (bound mostly with mixed gums arabic/karaya and tragacanth) with layers of the clear unpigmented animal glue, and usually ended with ink outlining and a final layer of glue, followed by a coat or two of clear varnish that would seal the glue from humidity. The Tate authors do not try to sort out which properties Blake sought from the individual constituents of his paints, but I suspect that he used the gums and glue for different purposes. Although there is a long tradition of using glue as a binding medium, especially in medieval icon painting, glue-bound colors may have been less satisfactory or less familiar to Blake than the gum-bound colors he used in his watercolors. My informal experiments with gums suggest that for his temperas Blake might have relied on the gum arabic to provide good brushing characteristics and pigment dispersion, and on the tragacanth to inhibit washing up, to reduce runniness, and to segregate different pigments, thus inhibiting adverse reactions. As noted above, even very thick tragacanth/arabic mixtures collapse to a fraction of their hydrated size when the water in them evaporates,<ref target="n99" type="note">9</ref> whereas glue layers remain relatively deep and clear as they set and dry, so the latter would have been the main source of depth in Blake’s finished pictures.<ref target="n100" type="note">10</ref> I have not experimented with cherry gum, which is found in a few pictures, but the Tate authors suggest that it also may have contributed to the enamel-like effects that Blake apparently sought. <note id="n99">9. The thickening effect of the tragacanth may have been most important to the color printing process, since the physical properties of the wet colors would matter a great deal there. When whiting or similar substances were included, as in many of Blake’s temperas and prints, these would limit collapse.</note><note id="n100">10. Blake’s final coats of varnish may also have contributed to the depth of his temperas and color prints, and may have had another beneficial effect. The Tate analyses indicate that many of the large color prints and temperas contain lead white, but the pictures do not consistently show the characteristic blackening that occurs when lead carbonate is exposed to sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide in the air. On deteriorating lead white in the illuminated books, see Michael Phillips, <hi rend="i">William Blake: The Creation of the</hi> Songs (Princeton: Princeton UP, 2000) 106-07. I don’t think Blake varnished illuminated book pages, so it might have been varnishes (and/or substantial amounts of tragacanth) that protected the lead white in the large color prints and temperas.</note></p>
          <p>The researchers report that in addition to the gum mixtures, animal glue is also found in the layers of pigment, so Blake may have mixed warm (or diluted) glue and wet gums with the pigments as he worked or added color while the glue layers were still wet. It is also possible that dilute glue washes seeped into cracked layers of gum. Future experiments with the properties of glues and gums may answer questions about the temperas and large color prints that were not susceptible to the analyses reported here, especially questions about which properties of each of these materials Blake sought in their various applications.<ref target="n101" type="note">11</ref><note id="n101">11. It is puzzling that he used some materials that had the very properties he condemned in oil paint, for his gum binders collapse, and he used lead white, which he knew could turn black (E 530-31).</note></p>
          <p>A chapter on the present appearance of the temperas notes that many of them have darkened, some in his lifetime, and others since then. Blake apparently sought transparency and depth in both his temperas and large color prints, but these qualities have not consistently survived. Careless “restoration”
<pb id="p39-54" n="54"/>
may be partly to blame, but the mixing of carbohydrates (gums, sugars) and proteins (glue) in the temperas may have led to a phenomenon called the “Maillard reaction”<ref target="n102" type="note">12</ref> that turned many of the tempera colors brownish and rendered formerly transparent layers translucent or opaque. Other darkening may have other causes: the picture of <hi rend="i">Satan Calling Up His Legions</hi> at the Victoria and Albert contains only plant gums but is now so dark that it is virtually impossible to see anything in it; the egregious obscurity of this picture and some others in the 1809 Exhibition may have been part of a deliberate deadpan joke about darkness visible, dark masters, and chiaroscuro.<ref target="n103" type="note">13</ref> The Tate authors suggest Blake’s habit of returning to his work again and again may also have led to darkening in the temperas, as layer upon layer of color, gums, glue, and urban dirt obscured and finally buried the underlying white of the ground and reflections from the gold and silver that he embedded in the glue. <note id="n102">12. This is the same complex reaction that browns food when it is cooked.</note><note id="n103">13. Similarly, <hi rend="i">The Goats, an Experiment Picture</hi>, in which “picturesque scenery” has been “laboured to a superabundant blackness,” may have been calculated to frustrate goatish connoisseurs hoping to get a glimpse of the dark “savage girls” as hungry goats stripped them of their vine-leaf garments.</note></p>
          <p>The book ends with an illuminating chapter by Townsend, Hamlyn, and John Anderson on the history of presenting Blake’s paintings and prints, including practices and economic considerations circa 1800 relevant to mounting, framing, collecting, storing, and hanging pictures like Blake’s in various contexts (in exhibitions, galleries, private homes), as well as their more recent presentation in museums. One might expect this chapter to be of most interest to those who will hang future exhibitions, but the discussion casts light upon all sorts of questions, especially about Blake’s audiences and patrons and what he made of them and they of him. In one case, the authors show that the framing history of several works suggests that influential inscriptions long associated with Blake are more likely from the mid-nineteenth century.</p>
          <p>I am only beginning to digest the information presented in this book, and to reread earlier studies in its light, but it has already done more to clarify Blake’s painting and color-printing practices for me than anything I have read in the last twenty years. I believe that even Blake enthusiasts who usually avoid technical questions will find many of the discussions here to be “sweet science,” and recommend it to them as wholeheartedly as I do to those who are already interested in this kind of material fact. Blake’s discussions of art veer unpredictably between the technical, the theoretical, and the spiritual, and we should all prepare ourselves to rethink all aspects of Blake’s aesthetics in light of the technical discoveries in this book. I look forward to the many uses that students of Blake will find for the information here, particularly reports from artists who have used it as the basis for a new round of experiments with Blake’s color-printing and tempera techniques.</p>

So we red-eyed it from Vancouver to TO<lb/>
where it was cold as February, you know—<lb/>
and lined up for BLAKE—in letters six-feet high—<lb/>
that morning some twenty years gone by<lb/>
outside and inside the AGO.<lb/>
This ‘optic heart’ remembers<lb/>
the burnished and intricately lined copperplate glow<lb/>
of his <hi rend="i">Canterbury Pilgrims</hi>—what happened<lb/>
if the burin slipped?<lb/><lb/>
That evening as Frye held forth<lb/>
on Blake’s Bible Illustrations (sans slides, of course)<lb/>
one found them gently arising<lb/>
in one’s still sleepless mind to his discourse.<lb/>
Afterwards chatting with him and a few others<lb/>
over coffee and cookies (it being the U of T)—<lb/>
our wives discussing the Group of Seven—he<lb/>
confiding that ‘Urizen is necessary,’ me<lb/>
mentioning that I knew a poet whose zip-<lb/>
code began with LOS: he<lb/>
registering that with an <hi rend="i">augenblick.</hi><lb/><lb/>
Next morning outside the hotel at dawn I catch<lb/>
a cab and am joined by a sudden highjacking stranger—<lb/>
for the short ride to the Gallery (no danger):<lb/>
guy sitting beside me says, ‘I’m Bill Mitchell.’<lb/>
I almost reply I’m Haile Selassie<lb/>
but manage, ‘I’ve read your book,’<lb/>
whereupon we both lapse into jet-lagged silence.<lb/>
Then he reels off,<lb/>
‘If Blake wrote this when he sat down to shite<lb/>
What could he not do if he sat down to write?’<lb/>
‘Yeah,’ I mutter, feeling a bit warmer as we arrive.
