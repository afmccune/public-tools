        <p>Like many of Blake’s separate graphics, "Enoch" offers several
                    problems for those who wish to determine its exact medium, date, and the
                    circumstances surrounding its production. Even the subject of Blake’s
                    only known lithograph was not discovered until 1936.<ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> My purpose here is to review what we know about the techniques
                    Blake used to create "Enoch" and present some new information on its
                    relationship to the history of early lithography in England. <note id="n1"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Laurence Binyon and Geoffrey Keynes, introductiont to
                            <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of Job by William Blake</hi> (New
                        York: Pierpont Morgan Library, 1935), p. 8 of the first fascicle. The
                        authors credit Joseph Wicksteed with the discovery that the inscription on
                        the book held by the central figure is "Enoch" in Hebrew; the
                        inscription on the tablet held by a floating figure on the right is
                        "And Enoch walked with God" (from Genesis V:24). Previous
                        authorities had believed that the design pictured "Job in
                        Prosperity," the title given to it by A. G. B. Russell in <hi rend="i">The Engravings of William Blake</hi> (Boston and New York: Houghton
                        Nifflin, 1912), p. 91. The error is understandable because the design is
                        closely connected with Blake’s development of a composition he also
                        used in his Job illustrations, culminating in the lower half of the central
                        design on pl. 2 of the <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings. Apparently some
                        scholars have not been convinced by Wicksteed’s findings; S. Foster
                        Damon, for example, describes the print as "‘Job in
                        Prosperity’ . . . holding on his lap an open book labelled (in
                        Hebrew) ‘Enoch’." See Damon, <hi rend="i">A Blake
                            Dictionary</hi> (Providence, R. I.: Brown University Press, 1965), p.
                        126.</note></p>
        <p>The pen and ink inscription (illus. 1) on the verso of an impression of
                    "Enoch" in the collection of Mr. Edward Croft-Murray (illus. 2) would
                    seem to offer a description of how the print was made. The handwriting is George
                    Cumberland’s, whose own involvement with graphic experiments, and in
                    particular with Blake’s plans to publish an account of his
                        inventions,<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> lends some authority to the
                    inscription. Mr. Croft-Murray tells me that the print appeared in a
                    Sotheby’s auction in 1957 as part of a miscellaneous lot that included a
                    number of Italian engravings that were probably from Cumberland’s
                    extensive collection of such material. Cumberland probably acquired his
                    "Enoch" directly from Blake, and his description on its verso may very
                    well be based on Blake’s own account of how he made the print, as the
                    last two words of the note indicate. The inscription reads as follows: <q> White
                        Lyas—is the Block / draw with Ink composed of asphaltum dissolved in
                        dry [?] / Linseed oil—add fine venetian Tripoli &amp; [?] Rotten
                        Stone Powder. / Let it dry. when dry saturate the stone with water and / Dab
                        it with the broad Dabber, and [<hi rend="i">deleted</hi>] coverd very thinly
                        with / best Printers Ink—and Print as a block—. / of
                            Blake.<ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref></q> If we assume the general accuracy of Cumberland’s account, the
                    "Block" or stone was white lias, a limestone from an area near Bath in
                    southwestern England, rather than the German Kellheim stone used by Alois
                    Senefelder in the lithographic process he invented in the mid-1790s.<ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> Instead of using lithographic chalk or ink,
                    Blake drew his design with a mixture of asphaltum and linseed oil which, if not
                    the acid resist he actually used in his copperplate relief etchings, must have
                    been a liquid with very similar physical properties. Besides the chemical
                    differences between this mixture and lithographic ink,<ref target="n5" type="note">5</ref> Blake’s material was probably more glutinous and
                    would have to be heated so as to flow evenly from the brush or pen and harden
                    quickly upon contact with the cool stone. According to Cumberland’s note,
                    Blake added "Tripoli" and/or rotten stone, both fine polishing
                    compounds, to his resist, perhaps simply as a thickener or to increase the
                    receptivity of the resist to printing ink. At this point, the usual procedure in
                    early nineteenth-century lithography, at least as practiced in England, would
                    have required a lithographic etch, water wash, and gum-water treatment to
                    increase the stone’s ability to hold water and repel ink. The first of
                    these procedures actually reduced the surface of the stone wherever it was not
                    protected by the lithographic ink or chalk, which functioned like the ground or
                    acid resist in copperplate etching. Although he later realized that the proper
                    inking of the stone depended almost completely on the antipathy of the oily
                    printing ink to the water-soaked stone, Senefelder states in his <hi rend="i">Complete Course</hi>, p. 10, that he etched his early stones to a depth of
                    "about a 10th part of a line, (or 1-120th part of an inch)." That this
                    practice was continued in early English lithography is indicated by Thomas
                    Fisher who notes, in the <hi rend="i">Gentleman’s Magazine</hi> of <pb id="p14-181" n="181"/> 1808, that "that part of the face of the stone
                    not actually covered with the ink is lowered about the thickness of half a line
                    [i.e., about 1/24 of an inch?]."<ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref> Thus,
                    "polyautography" (as early lithography was called) was a relief
                    process and not a true planographic technique like modern lithography. <note id="n2"><hi rend="s">2</hi> Letters between Cumberland and Blake of

                        too soft and porous" for lithography. Michael Twyman, <hi rend="i">Lithography 1800-1850</hi> (London: Oxford University Press, 1970), p.

                        viscous variant of the chemical ink. For what we know of the acid resist

        <p>If Cumberland did not accidently leave these steps out of his description, then
                    Blake’s method required neither etching nor gumming-up and he added only
                    water to repel the printing ink from the uncovered surface of the stone. The
                    foreshortening of the conventional procedure may have been possible because
                    Blake’s asphaltum and linseed oil resist would itself raise the image
                    above the level of the stone. Asphaltum will solidify at a slightly higher level
                    than any smooth surface to which it is applied.<ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> Finally, Blake inked the stone with a "broad Dabber,"
                    which must have been a large type-printer’s inking ball of the sort
                    generally used in early English lithography,<ref target="n8" type="note">8</ref>
                    and printed the stone "as a block"—that is, in relief like a
                    woodcut or one of Blake’s own copperplates for his illuminated books.

        <p>If we can trust Cumberland’s intriguing inscription, "Enoch" was
                    produced by a hybrid technique combining the stone and water elements of early
                    lithography with an acid resist very similar, perhaps even identical, to that
                    used by Blake in his own relief etchings. The awkward execution of some passages
                    in the design (note, for example, the two faces upper left) may be the result of
                    the experimental nature of the medium and Blake’s unfamiliarity with
                    working on a stone that was far more porous than his copperplates. It is even
                    possible that Cumberland played a role in the preparation of the stone; similar
                    types of gracelessness of line and stiffness in the figures appear in the
                    outline engravings (or perhaps simply drypoint sketches) he made for his <hi rend="i">Thoughts on Outline</hi> (1796). It must be admitted, however, that
                    Blake’s own work, particularly drawings executed in the 1780s, is not
                    free from such features.</p>
        <p>A basically similar use of acid resist on a lithographic stone, but one that
                    required etching, is described by William Home Lizars in his "Account of a
                    New Style of Engraving on Copper in Alto Relievo" in <hi rend="i">The
                        Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</hi>, 2 (January-April 1820), 23. In a
                    letter dated January 1819, Cumberland wrote his son to "tell <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> a Mr Sivewright [thanked by Lizars for assistance] of Edinburgh
                    has just claimed in Home Philosophical Journal of Last Month As his own

                    "Home Philosophical Journal," and the relationship between
                    Cumberland’s letter and Lizars’ article (the former dated a year
                    before the publication of the latter)remains a mystery. But E. B.
                    Murray’s astute redating of one of Blake’s letters to Thomas
                        Butts<ref target="n10" type="note">10</ref> has suggested to me the
                    possibility that Cumberland failed to change to the new year when he dated his
                    letter in January, and thus it may have actually been written late in the first
                    month of 1820 and does indeed refer to Lizars’ article. In any case, it
                    is quite possible that Blake knew of Lizars’ work, but the information
                    could not have reached him until long after he had produced "Enoch."

        <p>A. G. B. Russell, Laurence Binyon, and Sir Geoffrey Keynes have all associated
                    the execution of "Enoch" with the lithographic publishing endeavors of
                    Georg Jacob Vollweiler.<ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref> Late in 1800,
                    Senefelder came to England and patented his new process of polyautography.<ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> He brought with him Philipp André,
                    to whom Senefelder had taught the new process. When he returned to Germany after
                    a visit in England lasting about seven months, Senefelder sold the patent to
                    André, who stayed in London. In 1803, André issued <hi rend="i">Specimens of Polyautography</hi> containing twelve lithographs by various
                    English artists, including Barry, Stothard, and Fuseli. When André left
                    London in 1805, Vollweiler took over as patentee. He reissued <hi rend="i">Specimens</hi>, adding to it twenty-four new prints, with a title-page
                    dated 1806 but with some prints inscribed 1807 on the stone. Like the first
                    issue, Vollweiler’s publication attracted little notice, and he returned
                    to Germany in August 1807. His lithographic equipment passed into the hands of
                    D. Redman, who removed the business to Bath in 1813. <note id="n11"><hi rend="s">11</hi> Russell, <hi rend="i">Engravings of Blake</hi>, p. 91; Binyon,

                    Cumberland’s description of Blake’s experimental procedures would
                    seem on the face of it to dissociate his work from the entire
                    Senefelder-André-Vollweiler enterprise. It seems improbable that the
                    inventor of lithography or his official successors in London would sponsor a
                    project that did not follow normal lithographic procedures on which they held
                    the patent. The special properties of Kellheim stone would logically have been
                    one of the keys to their secret, patented process, and the substitution of
                    another, locally obtainable stone something that the patentees would eschew.
                    This is the line of thinking I set forth in my previous comments on
                        "Enoch,"<ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref> but some new
                    evidence I have come upon indicates a very different conclusion. Several
                    crucial, if not absolutely conclusive, pieces of evidence do link
                    "Enoch" to Vollweiler’s activities. <note id="n13"><hi rend="s">13</hi> Fisher, <hi rend="i">Gentleman’s Magazine</hi>, p. 195,

                            Printmaker</hi>, pp. 161-63. While I am on the tedious subject of
                        correcting my own errors, let me point out that fig. 4 in <hi rend="i">Printmaker</hi>, a detail from "View of St Peter’s
                        Church" after Thyne O’Niell, was not engraved by Blake’s
                        master, James Basire (1730-1802), but by his son and successor of the same
                        name (1769-1822). My error was caused by a pencil inscription on the verso
                        of a trimmed impression in my collection indicating that the print was
                        produced c. 1775, and thus necessarily by the elder Basire. However,
                        Professor Christopher Heppner has very kindly pointed out to me that the
                        print appears on the <hi rend="i">Oxford Almanack</hi> of 1809. The whole
                        design, much reduced, is reproduced in Helen Mary Petter, <hi rend="i">The
                            Oxford Almanacks</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1974), p. 84, where it
                        is noted that the painting was commissioned from Hugh O’Neill (who
                        apparently also used the name "Thyne O’Niell") in 1806.
                        Thus the plate must be by the younger Basire. My purpose in reproducing a
                        detail from it in <hi rend="i">Printmaker</hi> was to show typical features
                        of the senior Basire’s style, particularly twisted lines on rounded
                        forms and worm lines in landscapes, later used by Blake. The first technique
                        can be found in just about any arm or leg delineated by Blake’s
                        master; the worm lines appear in a number of his book
                        illustrations—see for example James Stuart and Nicholas Revett, <hi rend="i">The Antiquities of Athens</hi>, vol. I (1762), pl. 1; <hi rend="i">Vetusta Monumenta</hi>, vol. II, pl. 24 ("View of Richmond
                        Palace" dated 1765); Jacob Bryant, <hi rend="i">A New System, or, an
                            Analysis of Ancient Mythology</hi> (1774-76), vol. I, pls. 2, 3, 7, vol.
                        II, pl. 1 (lower left in the upper panel); <hi rend="i">Archaeologia</hi>,
                        vol. III (1775), pl. 17 facing p. 315; Richard Gough, <hi rend="i">Sepulchral Monuments in Great Britain</hi> (1786), pl. 14 facing p. 42.
                        Some of these examples are very close to the worm lines in plates by the
                        younger Basire and by Blake, although both may have been directly influenced
                        by William Woollett’s practices. Woollett was famous for his use of
                        heavy worm lines, or "needling," and was apparently much admired
                        by the senior Basire since he gave his son Richard the middle name of
                        Woollett (see <hi rend="i">Printmaker</hi>, pp. 199-200).</note></p>
        <p>Fisher, writing in the <hi rend="i">Gentleman’s Magazine</hi> in 1808 (see
                    my note 6), remarks that "M. Andre imported them [the lithographic stones]
                    from Germany, although his successor [Vollweiler] assured me that stone [i.e.,
                    white lias] of a nearly similar quality might be procured in the neighbourhood
                    of Bath, but not, he believed, in very large blocks" (pp. 193-94). This
                    statement does not prove that Vollweiler actually used white lias, but it does
                    indicate that he was amenable to its use and suggests that one of the reasons
                    his successor, Redman, moved to Bath may have been the availability of proper
                    stones in that area. According to Felix Man, "Vollweiler issued circulars
                    asking amateurs to try their hand in the new art, offering instructions and

        <p>The papers on which three of the four extant impressions of "Enoch" are
                    printed suggest a further connection with Vollweiler. The print in the British
                    Museum is on the same type of buff colored wove paper, and both the image (21.7
                    × 31 cm.) and the sheet (22.6 × 31.9 cm.) are of about the same
                    size, as several of the <hi rend="i">Specimens</hi> prints, second issue, bound
                    with it. The chocolate brown wove paper on which the copies in the collections
                    of Sir Geoffrey Keynes and Raymond Lister are printed is similar in color and
                    texture to the stock used for the chalk manner lithographs in P. E.
                    Stroehling’s <hi rend="i">Original Sketches Drawn Upon Stone</hi>,
                    published by Vollweiler shortly before he left London, and for the prints in <hi rend="i">Twelve Views in Scotland, Delineated by a Lady</hi> [F. Waring] <hi rend="i">in the Polyautographic Art of Drawing Upon Stone</hi>, published by
                    Rudolph Ackermann in 1803.<ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref> I know of no
                    other prints by Blake, executed in any medium, printed on these unusual types of
                    paper. Finally, a standard plate printing press of the early nineteenth century
                    could only have been adapted for lithographic printing with considerable
                    difficulty because of the thickness of the stone. In all probability, Blake
                    would have had to turn to someone with the requisite equipment to pull good
                    quality impressions from his stone. The only people in England so equipped until
                    1812 were André, Vollweiler, and Redman.<ref target="n17" type="note">17</ref> Thus, the preponderance of the evidence suggests that Blake
                    learned of lithography from Vollweiler, rented or borrowed the stone from him,
                    delineated "Enoch" in an acid resist similar to the liquid he had used
                    for years for his relief etchings, and returned the stone to Vollweiler for
                    printing. The first three of these steps could have occurred only in 1806 or
                    early 1807, after Vollweiler had taken over the London lithographic business
                    from André and before he departed for Germany. The printing could have
                    been done by Redman at a later time, but it would have been to the economic
                    advantage of all concerned to proof "Enoch" shortly after its
                    execution and remove Blake’s work from the stone so that it could be used
                    again for another drawing. <note id="n16"><hi rend="s">16</hi> Five of the
                        Stroehling lithographs on brown paper are in the British Museum. In 1803,
                        Ackermann could only have learned of lithography from André, who very
                        probably also provided Ackermann with the stones and pulled the impressions.

                        states that "Enoch" is "clearly recognizable as a Vollweiler
                        print," but does not say why.</note></p>
        <p>Blake could not have learned about Senefelder’s inventions until a good
                    many years after he had developed his own methods of relief etching on copper.
                    Even the most sophisticated manipulations of relief etching and its integration
                    with white-line etching/engraving are displayed as early as 1793 in <hi rend="i">America.</hi> Yet Blake must have been very interested in whatever he could
                    learn about lithography from Vollweiler or other practitioners since early
                    polyautography was so similar, in its essential relief-etched characteristics,
                    to his own techniques. The plans to publish an account of Blake’s
                    inventions (see my note 2) may have been stimulated by his learning about rival
                    techniques such as Senefelder’s etching on stone and Lizars’
                    etching in relief on metal or stone. Blake might have learned something from
                    contacts with Vollweiler that he could apply to his own copperplate methods,
                    although there is no evidence for this in Blake’s relief etchings after
                    1806-1807. Senefelder had developed a method of transferring a text or design
                    written in lithographic ink from gummed paper to a stone,<ref target="n18" type="note">18</ref> and Vollweiler may have known about this technique.
                    This was most useful to artists who, unlike Blake, were not professional
                    engravers and thus were not proficient at writing or designing with right and
                    left reversed. I very much doubt that Blake needed to use a transfer technique;
                    if he did, he must have invented it independently some years before his contacts
                    with Vollweiler. Although lithography’s influence on the illuminated
                    books could only have been minimal and late, "Enoch" does provide a
                    unique point of indirect contact between William Blake and Alois Senefelder, two
                    of the greatest innovators in the graphic arts. <note id="n18"><hi rend="s">18</hi> See Senefelder, <hi rend="i">Complete Course</hi>, pp. 121-22,

        <p>When J. T. Nettleship died in 1902, he was a successful artist who had
                    specialized in wild animal subjects. According to <hi rend="i">The Magazine of
                        Art</hi>, "He took as his models the animals which have not come under
                    human domination, the larger beasts of prey, fierce and untameable; and he
                    sought habitually to realise all their strenuous energy and ferocity."<ref target="n19" type="note">1</ref> From 1874 until 1901 he exhibited regularly
                    at the Royal Academy as well as at the New Gallery and the Grosvenor
                        Gallery.<ref target="n20" type="note">2</ref> He also published two books:
                        <hi rend="i">Essays on Robert Browning’s Poetry</hi><ref target="n21" type="note">3</ref> and <hi rend="i">George Morland and the Evolution from
                        Him of Some Later Landscape Painters.</hi><ref target="n22" type="note">4</ref> His daughter Ida had married Augustus John. To his contemporaries
                    Nettleship could appear at the same time to be "our later Landseer"
                    and "a lord of Bohemia."<ref target="n23" type="note">5</ref> Yet in
                    the early 1870s, at the beginning of his career, Nettleship had created works of
                    a much different kind than those which made his reputation. "It is to be
                    regretted that none of the designs conceived in this period was ever properly
                    finished," wrote James Sutherland Cotton, who had known Nettleship.
                    "They included Biblical scenes, such as ‘Jacob wrestling with the
                    Angel,’ and ‘A Sower went forth to sow,’ which have been
                    deservedly compared with the work of William Blake."<ref target="n24" type="note">6</ref> Nettleship’s early work was indeed heavily
                    influenced by Blake, and when he came to frequent the Rossetti circle, he
                    brought his "Blake drawings" (as they came to be known in the
                    Nettleship family) with him. <note id="n19"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Anon., "J.

        <p>According to William Michael Rossetti, Nettleship may have been introduced to the
                    Rossettis by mutual friends—John Payne or Arthur O’Shaughnessy,
                    both poets. "As he had not from the first been destined for the pictorial
                    profession," wrote Rossetti of Nettleship, "he was older than most
                    beginners, twenty-seven. He was an intellectual young man, full of abstract
                    conceptions: such a subject as ‘God Creating Evil’ had no terrors
                    for him—or I should rather say, not any such terrors as dissuaded him
                    from designing it."<ref target="n25" type="note">7</ref> Nettleship studied
                    painting at the Slade school, but the influence of Blake may have come to him
                    through "The Brotherhood," a group that included John Butler Yeats and
                    Edwin Ellis.<ref target="n26" type="note">8</ref> In this circle Nettleship
                    would also have met O’Shaughnessy, whose <hi rend="i">Epic of Women</hi>
                    he illustrated in 1870. At any rate, by the time Nettleship met Dante Gabriel
                    Rossetti, he had already acquired a Blakean pictorial vocabulary. According to
                    Gale Pedrick, he produced "sketches of a Blake-like kind [which] amazed and
                    delighted Rossetti with their audacity of treatment."<ref target="n27" type="note">9</ref> Until recently it was difficult to assess the impact
                    upon Rossetti and, later, upon W. B. Yeats of Nettleship’s "Blake
                    drawings," as they were the property of the Nettleship family. Now in the
                    collection of the University of Reading, their importance as early examples of
                    the influence of Blake’s art can at last be appreciated.<ref target="n28" type="note">10</ref><note id="n25"><hi rend="s">7</hi><hi rend="i"> Some Reminiscences of William Michael Rossetti</hi> (London:

        <p>Nettleship’s early drawings are varied in style as in subject matter. Some
                    are obviously indebted to Blake, while others are more conventionally Victorian.
                    Among the former are a series involving naked human figures and a huge serpent,
                    reminiscent of Blake’s Los, Enitharmon, child Orc and Orc <pb id="p14-186" n="186"/><figure><head>1 "God with eyes turned inward upon his own glory."</head><figDesc>Photographic reproduction, from Thomas Wright’s <hi rend="i">Life of Payne.</hi> Appendix I, no. 27.

                    checklist appended to this article (see Appendix I), while some members of the
                    group appear in nos. 5, 8, and 16. Although the components of the designs are
                    derived from Blake, Nettleship has not imitated any single design in them. In
                    this way he is similar to David Scott,<ref target="n29" type="note">11</ref> who
                    also used a Blakean vocabulary to create heroic scenes with their own
                    distinctive feeling. Some other "Blake drawings" <figure><head>3 Pencil drawing.</head><figDesc>Appendix I, no. 16.</figDesc></figure> are closer to specific sources. The diving figure of no. 11 strongly
                    resembles that of plate 14 in <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi>, save that
                    the artist has changed the position of the head after first drawing it in an
                    attitude more similar to Urizen’s. "God with eyes turned inward upon
                    his own glory" strongly suggests the Urizenic head of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> plate 22 and elsewhere. On the whole, however, it is not the
                    imitation of Blake that makes these drawings interesting but rather
                    Nettleship’s assimilation of Blake’s style with his own. <note id="n29"><hi rend="s">11</hi> On Scott, see David Irwin, "David Scott:

        <p>At about the same time that he executed the "Blake Drawings,"
                    Nettleship did five illustrations for Arthur W. E. O’Shaughnessy’s

                    book, published by the enterprising John Camden Hotten<ref target="n30" type="note">12</ref> in 1870. In these designs the influence of Blake,
                    though apparent, is further subordinated to Nettleship’s own manner. The
                    title page shows a male nude in the foreground, reclining in a garden-like
                    setting and staring over the sea to the rising sun. A titanic nude male wearing
                    a chaplet of stars leans down pointing from the top of the picture; a female
                    figure on the left with a chain fastened to her waist raises her arms, hands
                    clasped, upward. None of these figures is copied from Blake, but the effect of
                    the whole suggests the illustrations to <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts.</hi> Two
                    female figures in other designs recall Oothoon in <pb id="p14-187" n="187"/><figure><head>4 Title page for <hi rend="i">Epic of Women</hi> by Arthur W. E.

                    the end of "A Neglected Harp," chained round the waist to the harp and
                    manacled by the right ankle. She is almost a reversed-position version of
                    Oothoon in <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> 4, hovering in a flame-like wave while
                    chained by the left ankle. The nude at the end of "A Troth for
                    Eternity" resembles Oothoon in <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> 3, but Nettleship,
                    in accord with O’Shaughnessy’s poem, has replaced Blake’s
                    eagle with a dagger. For the poem called "Exile," Nettleship repeated
                    the male figure of the title page foreground, and for "Bisclavet" he
                    drew a strikingly original design showing a sea of androgynous-looking figures
                    with strangely accentuated lips. <hi rend="i">Epic of Women</hi>, according to
                    both Richard Garnett and Edmund Gosse,<ref target="n31" type="note">13</ref> was
                    well received, and these pictures could have meant the beginning of a promising
                    career as a book illustrator for Nettleship. Indeed, according to Thomas Wright,
                    Nettleship produced a drawing for O’Shaugnessy’s next book of
                    verse, but his new publisher objected on the ground of indecency, saying
                    "The British public has to be studied."<ref target="n32" type="note">14</ref> In any event, O’Shaughnessy’s <hi rend="i">Lays of

                    "revised": some of the pictures are in the style of the "Blake

                    of the interest in animals that had already begun to dominate
                    Nettleship’s art, but these subjects are treated without imaginative
                    force. Nevertheless, Nettleship’s animal pictures were bringing him the
                    popular recognition that had been denied the "Blake drawings." Of
                    these Thomas Wright says, "With all his endeavours success seemed

        <p>William Butler Yeats was introduced to Nettleship by Yeats’ father some
                    time in the period 1887-91. Yeats had previously been so impressed by one of the
                    animal paintings that he had written a poem entitled "On Mr.
                    Nettleship’s Picture at the Royal Hibernian Academy": <q> Yonder the
                        sickle of the moon sails on,<lb/> But here the Lioness licks her soft
                        cub<lb/> Tender and fearless on her funeral pyre;<lb/> Above, saliva
                        dropping from his jaws,<lb/> The Lion, the world’s great solitary,
                        bends<lb/> Lowly the head of his magnificence<lb/> And roars, mad with the
                        touch of the unknown,<lb/> Not as he shakes the forest; but a cry<lb/> Low,
                        long and musical. A dew-drop hung<lb/> Bright on a grass blade’s
                        under side, might hear,<lb/> Nor tremble to its fall. The fire sweeps
                        round<lb/> Re-shining in his eyes. So ever moves<lb/> The flaming circle of
                        the outer Law,<lb/> Nor heeds the old, dim protest and the cry<lb/> The orb
                        of the most inner living heart<lb/> Gives forth. He, the Eternal, works His
                            will.<ref target="n35" type="note">17</ref><note id="n35"><hi rend="s">17</hi> First published in the <hi rend="i">Dublin University Review</hi> for April 1886, p. 3. MS version

                    conventionally rhetorical, the analogy of the lion’s eye to the circle of
                    the outer law and to the orb of the living heart is too obviously contrived, and
                    the last line seems produced by the will to end with an emphatic flourish. Yeats
                    was to change his mind, too, about the quality of Nettleship’s animal
                    paintings—by the time he met the artist, Yeats considered him "once
                    inventor of imaginative designs and now a painter of melodramatic
                        lions."<ref target="n36" type="note">18</ref> Yeats tells of how he was
                    impressed by the courage and asceticism of Nettleship, by then a reformed
                    alcoholic who incessantly drank cocoa. <note id="n36"><hi rend="s">18</hi>

        <q> He thought [Yeats writes] that any weakness, even a weakness of the body, had
                    the character of sin and while at breakfast with his brother, with whom he
                    shared a room on the third floor of a corner house, he said that his nerves were
                    out of order. Presently, he left the table and got out through the window and on
                    to the stone ledge that ran along the wall under the window-sills. He sidled
                    along the ledge, and turning the corner with it, got in at a different window
                    and returned to the table. ‘My nerves,’ he said, ‘are
                    better than I thought.’<ref target="n37" type="note">19</ref><note id="n37"><hi rend="s">19</hi> "Four Years," p. 83.</note></q>

        <p>Nettleship, responding to the young poet’s admiration, showed Yeats some
                    of his early drawings. Yeats responded enthusiastically: <q> . . . They, though
                        often badly drawn, fulfilled my hopes. Something of Blake they certainly did
                        show, but had in place of Blake’s joyous intellectual energy a
                        Saturnian passion and melancholy. God Creating Evil, the death-like head
                        with a woman and a tiger coming from the forehead which Rossetti—or
                        was it Browning?—had described as ‘the most sublime design of
                        ancient or modern art’ had been lost, but there was another version
                        of the same thought, and other designs never published or exhibited. They
                        rise before me even now in meditation, especially a blind Titian-like ghost
                        floating with groping hands above the tree-tops.<ref target="n38" type="note">20</ref><note id="n38"><hi rend="s">20</hi> "Four Years," pp.
                            81-82.</note></q> These pictures stimulated Yeats to write his first piece of art criticism.
                    It is not clear what became of this essay. In <hi rend="i">The Dial</hi> Yeats
                    says it was rejected by an editor "lifting what I considered an obsequious
                    caw in the Huxley, Tyndall, Carolus Duran rookery."<ref target="n39" type="note">21</ref> Yet in his letters to Kathleen Tynan Yeats gives a
                    different account. On 28 February 1890 he writes of his work at hand: "Then
                    comes an article on Nettleship’s designs for the <hi rend="i">Art
                        Review</hi>—great designs never published before—and later an
                    article on Blake and his anti-materialistic Art, for somewhere"; but on 1
                    July 1890 he reports "I am working on Blake and such things. The <hi rend="i">Art Review</hi> has come to an end and so unhappily my article on
                    Nettleship’s designs is useless."<ref target="n40" type="note">22</ref> Like the original "God Creating Evil," Yeats’s
                    essay on Nettleship appears to have been lost. <note id="n39"><hi rend="s">21</hi> "Four Years," p. 82.</note><note id="n40"><hi rend="s">22</hi><hi rend="i"> The Letters of W. B. Yeats</hi>, ed. Allan Wade (London: Rupert

        <p>Yeats made on effort to re-enlist Nettleship in the service of visionary art. He
                    commissioned the artist to draw the frontispiece for the first edition of <hi rend="i">The Countess Kathleen and Various Legends and Lyrics</hi>,
                    published by T. Fisher Unwin in 1892. The resulting picture of Cuchillin
                    fighting the waves was so lacking in conviction that Yeats was not encouraged to
                    make a second attempt "to restore one old friend of my father’s to
                    the practice of his youth."<ref target="n41" type="note">23</ref>
                    England’s second Landseer returned to his animal painting.
                    "Nettleship," concluded Yeats, "had found his simplifying image,
                    but in his painting had turned away from it. . . . "<ref target="n42" type="note">24</ref><note id="n41"><hi rend="s">23</hi> "Four Years," p. 80.</note><note id="n42"><hi rend="s">24</hi> "Four Years," p. 83.</note></p>

          <p>MS 7/27/19. Sepia colored autotype reproduction. 23 × 28 cm. Inscribed
                        at the top "Madness" and signed in the lower left hand corner:
                        "Made in the Summer of 1870 / J. T. Nettleship." Ms. note at the
                        bottom reads as follows: <q> The prostrate figure symbolizes a man who near
                            the summit of his career has been struck down by madness; hands as of
                            Earth-spirits come out of the ground, lift the circlet from his head,
                            and begin to draw him in, as worms suck in a straw. The male figures
                            behind him (right of the design) symbolize his past acts; they stab
                            themselves. The female figures symbolize the emotions; they wait. The
                            figures behind him, up to the hill top (left of the design) symbolize
                            his future achievements; they throw away crown and stars which were to
                            be his rewards. Every face in the drawing is bowed and hidden, for
                            shame’s sake. <hi rend="u">x</hi> The design embodies the <hi rend="i">prospective</hi> fear, in any sane mind, that madness must
                            mean an annihilation of all individuality, of all the results of past
                            effort or love, and of all future hopes of achievement. But the
                            earth-spirits, while they take the man to themselves, out of sight,,
                            perhaps renew him, but not as the same unity.<lb/><lb/><hi rend="s">x</hi> The figure next in front of the prostrate man gives
                            back to the male figure just behind him some pledge that had been given
                            to the future, some unfinished work—useless now. The embodiment
                            of past acts and emotions makes them as it were friends and lovers of
                            the man, identified with his aims.<lb/><lb/> J. T. Nettleship<lb/> 22

        <p>While the Romantics looked to nature’s mountains in the form of Mont
                    Blanc, the Jungfrau, or Skiddaw to find a visible externalization of their
                        psychology,<ref target="n43" type="note">1</ref> Blake’s mountains
                    reflect an interior vision of the mountains of mythology and those, not far
                    distant, of the Bible. These befit a poet who saw his visions in the worlds of
                    thought and, from all accounts, never saw a genuine mountain (much less a Welsh
                    one) in his life. Mircea Eliade summarizes the mythological dimension: <q>
                        Mountains are the nearest thing to the sky, and are thence endowed with a
                        twofold holiness: on the one hand they share in the spatial symbolism of
                        transcendence—they are ‘high,’
                        ‘vertical,’ ‘supreme,’ and so on—and on
                        the other, they are the especial domain of all hierophanies of atmosphere,
                        and therefore, the dwelling of the gods.<ref target="n44" type="note">2</ref></q> Their symbolic and religious significance, he continues, "is
                    endless." One can see the sacred quality stemming from the fact that
                    mountains penetrate the upper, pure regions of the atmosphere (aether) carried
                    on in seventeenth-century poetic diction, where standard non-negative epithets
                    are "cloud-touching, star-brushing."<ref target="n45" type="note">3</ref> For the ancient Greeks the upper air, source of meteors and other
                    meteorological events, was integrally related to mountains and "high
                        ground"—<hi rend="i">ta meteora</hi>; their conjunction offers
                    "a spot where one can pass from one cosmic zone to another" (Eliade,
                    p. 100). Blake writes of the "Atlantean hills" that "from their
                    bright summits you may pass to the Golden world" (<hi rend="i">Am</hi>
                    10.6, 7).<ref target="n46" type="note">4</ref> The dwelling of Zeus—Dios,
                    God of the Bright Sky—was Mount Olympus, but "olympus" was to
                    be found all over mountainous Greece; the word itself is the pre-Greek term for
                    "mountain." The Romans, though lacking mountains, nonetheless
                    dignified "their own poor little Capitol . . . with the title of
                        ‘Mons’"<ref target="n47" type="note">5</ref> and the
                    cosmological zone of the female body receives the same dignity.<ref target="n48" type="note">6</ref><note id="n43"><hi rend="s">1</hi> On the development of this trend, see
                        Marjorie Hope Nicolson, <hi rend="i">Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The
                            Development of the Aesthetics of the Infinite</hi>, The Norton Library
                        (1959, rpt.; New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1963). We may note here that
                        "mountains" do, in fact, appear more frequently in Blake’s
                        imagery (161 times in the poetry) than in Wordsworth’s or
                        Shelley’s. This is, to be sure, hardly true of mount/mountain imagery
                        at large; one finds at once that Blake uses no adjectival combinations such
                        as "mountain gloom" or "glory." But the
                        "mountains" themselves are more numerous, and more strange.</note><note id="n44"><hi rend="s">2</hi> Mircea Eliade, <hi rend="i">Patterns in

        <p>The closeness of God and the mountain is typified by the theophanies at Sinai. As
                    houses of God, they are also places of sacrifice, high—Latin <hi rend="i">alta</hi>—altars; in Genesis 22:2 God tells Abraham to offer his
                    son"for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee
                    of." So Los takes Orc "to the top of a mountain" (<hi rend="i">BU</hi> 20.21) to chain him down. The New Testament made great use of the
                    Old Testament symbolism, and its repeated description of Jesus’ going <hi rend="i">eis to oros</hi>, "up the mountain" or "into the
                    mountains," assumes a formulaic dimension.<ref target="n52" type="note">10</ref> Little wonder that Blake should characterize the two Testaments by
                    their respective dominant mountains: <q> Such is the Divine Written Law of Horeb
                        &amp; Sinai:<lb/> And such the Holy Gospel of Mount Olivet &amp;

                    Testaments: Mount Zion, "Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole
                    earth" (Ps. 48:2), "the holy Mountain" (Zech. 8:3) of the Lord
                    and synonymous with its city, Jerusalem. So Paul reminds the Hebrews, "But
                    ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly
                    Jerusalem" (12:22). Tiny Mount Zion is to "tower over the other
                    mountains" (Clifford, p. 157; cf. Is. 2:4, Mic. 4:1). <note id="n52"><hi rend="s">10</hi> Cf. Mt. 5:1, 14:23, 15:29; Mk. 3:13, 6:46; Lk.
                            6:12, 9:28; Jn. 6:3, 6:15. Thomas Fawcett nicely summarizes this
                            important theme: <q> In addition to being antitypical, many events in
                                Christ’s life are associated with the cosmic mountain. The
                                one in fact inevitably brought in the other by association. When
                                Jesus is made in Matthew’s gospel to give his new law from
                                the mount, there is both a fulfilment of the Sinai revelation in
                                view, and underlying this, the symbolism of the mountain as the
                                place of God’s disclosure to men. The motif appears on
                                several occasions. The narrative opens with a story of temptation in
                                which Christ formulates his message in confrontation with the Devil
                                and in reliance on the word of God, appropriately located on a
                                mountain. The moment of disclosure to the disciples of Jesus’
                                nature and mission takes place on the mount of Transfiguration. At
                                the summit of the mountain they see him converse with the saints of
                                the past. His crucifixion was later held to have taken place upon a
                                hill, and Calvary became the focal mountain for much Christian
                                theology, because at this moment above all it came to be held that
                                God had revealed himself to man. Finally the ascension is said to
                                have taken place on the mount of Olives in such a way that the
                                symbolism of the summit as the point of meeting between man and God
                                is clearly shown. His ascension from this point implies a summit in
                                which the two worlds of mythology are joined. </q> (<hi rend="i">Symbolic Language</hi>, p. 227)

        <p>As Jerusalem is to Mount Zion, so she was and will be to Albion; which is to say
                    that Albion is—or rather, was and will be—a holy mountain.
                    Holinshed, who begins his <hi rend="i">Chronicles</hi> discussing the legend of
                    the ancient denomination of England, refers to speculation "whether
                    Britaine was called Albion of the word Alb, white, or Alp an hill."<ref target="n53" type="note">11</ref> The name in fact is connected with the
                    root of Latin <hi rend="i">Alpis</hi>, Gaelic <hi rend="i">alp</hi>, and Irish
                        <hi rend="i">ailp</hi>, meaning mountain. Blake plays on this assonance and
                    etymological connection, imagining that Los’s "voice is heard from
                    Albion: the Alps &amp; Appenines / Listen" (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 85.16-17).
                    As only high mountains tend to be white (with snow), the traditional association
                    of Albion with <hi rend="i">albus</hi> could also be seen to suggest that Albion
                    was once a high mountain, now islanded by the sea. This could be confirmed by
                    Albion’s white cliffs, a word Blake generally uses in its less common
                    sense of "a steep slope, a hill." The cliffs are the sides of
                    Albion’s great mountain as it slips down below the surface of the sea:
                    " . . . Albion the White Cliff of the Atlantic / The Mountain of Giants . .
                    . " (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 49.6-7). <note id="n53"><hi rend="s">11</hi><hi rend="i"> Holinshed’s Chronicles of England, Scotland, and

        <p>Mountains are necessarily related to the image of the ocean deluge. Thomas
                    Burnet’s mytho-poetic <hi rend="i">Sacred Theory of the Earth</hi> (1681)
                    argued that the weight of the floodwaters broke the crust of the paradisal
                    "mundane egg" into mountains.<ref target="n54" type="note">12</ref> In
                    a somewhat similar manner, when Eternity rolls apart in <hi rend="i">The Book of
                        Urizen</hi> what is left is "mountainous all around," dominated by
                    "ruinous fragments of life / Hanging frowning cliffs &amp; all between /
                    An ocean of voidness unfathomable" (5.7, 9-11). Earlier cosmologies also
                    focused on the creation of "land" out of Chaos (if not
                    Eternity)—the deep, the Semitic <hi rend="i">Tehom.</hi> These traditions
                    imagined that the mountains were placed in <hi rend="i">Tehom</hi> to serve as
                    foundations of the world—they were the first dry land, like Mount Ararat
                    after the later flood. According to some rabbinical similes, "God’s
                    mountains reach down to the great Tehom" and "these mountains dominate
                    Tehom, lest it should rise and innundate the earth."<ref target="n55" type="note">13</ref> As foundations, the mountains are seen as the
                    "pillars of heaven" (Job 26:11, cf. 9:6). So in Albion/Jerusalem, <q>
                        Pancrass &amp; Kentish-town repose<lb/> Among her golden pillars high:<lb/>
                        Among her golden arches which<lb/> Shine upon the starry sky.<lb/> (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 27.9-12) </q> The cosmological scope of this reference
                    is clear remembering that the "pillard hall &amp; arched roof of Albions
                    skies" receive "the eternal wandering stars" (<hi rend="i">FZ</hi>, II, 25.16, 32.9; E 310, 315).<ref target="n56" type="note">14</ref> Since the flood represented the victory of Chaos, of Leviathan,
                    some rabbinical commentators held that the land of Israel was not submerged by
                    the Deluge, a belief which is paralleled in Islam. A. J. Wensinck comments: <q>
                        Why the Sanctuary is not attained by the waters of the Deluge is clear:
                        Deluge is the reign of Tehom, of old a demonic power, familiar from the
                        creation stories. The Sanctuary is the type and representation of Kosmos and
                        of Paradise and as such a power diametrically opposed to Chaos; when the
                        Semites maintain that the Sanctuary was not reached by the Deluge, this is
                        not only due to the opinion that the Sanctuary is the highest place in the
                        world, but also to the conviction that Chaos cannot gain a complete victory
                        over Kosmos, for behind the latter is the creative power of the supreme
                        being.<lb/> (pp. 15-16) </q></p>
        <p>This conception offers several analogies to Blake’s images, from that of
                    the one sense through which man may "himself pass out" (<hi rend="i">Eur</hi> iii.5) which remained after the other senses "whelm’d
                    in deluge" (<hi rend="i">Eur</hi> 10.10-11) over him, to the picture of
                    Albion as the mountain remaining when "the Atlantic Continent sunk round
                    Albions Cliffy shore / And the Sea pourd in amain" (<hi rend="i">J</hi>
                    32[36].40-41). The "sea of Time &amp; Space" is the principal deluge.
                    This may account for the frequent graphic depiction of an action taking place on
                    a location surrounded by water; it is an image of England, but it signifies also
                    imaginative vision, not yet drowned in Time and Space (or Realism or
                    Naturalism). So when Reuben sleeps "like one dead in the
                    valley"—the vale, or low-lying, submersible land—the notable
                    thing is that he is thus "Cut off from Albions mountains &amp; from all
                    the Earths summits" (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 30[34].43,44). "Wild seas
                    &amp; Rocks" are to "close up Jerusalem away from / The Atlantic
                    Moutains" (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 49.77-50.1). <hi rend="i">America</hi> tells
                    that <q> On those vast shady hills between America &amp; Albions shore;<lb/>

                        immortal pinnacles. . . .<lb/> (10.5-9) </q> One critic has called this
                    passage "iconic" and remarked its "tantalizing quality of
                    meanings nearly communicated yet withheld."<ref target="n57" type="note">15</ref> Without entering the context of <hi rend="i">America</hi> or the
                    "suitability of invoking the myth of a lost, paradisal Atlantis as a symbol
                    of transcendent unity,"<ref target="n58" type="note">16</ref> I would
                    simply emphasize that the mythic structure of the mountain sanctuary, temple,
                    palace is itself a "meaning communicated." The reader is told
                    something about the situation, appearance, and function of the summit-structure
                    and it takes its place among Blake’s visionary locales—the
                    description engages our attention by calling up latent (and several times
                    removed) mythological associations. The Atlantic, one should remember, is named
                    not for Atlantis, but for the Titan Atlas, seen in classical times as Mount
                    Atlas, the pillar of heaven. Atlas, Blake believed, was the Greek name for
                    Albion, "Patri<hi rend="i">arch</hi> of the Atlantic" (<hi rend="i">DC</hi>, E 534; italics added). Blake viewed <pb id="p14-198" n="198"/> his
                    Hesperian situation quite personally, as evident in the dedicatory poem to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, which says that his "designs unchangd
                    remain": <q> For above Times troubled Fountains<lb/> On the Great Atlantic
                        Mountains<lb/> In my Golden House on high<lb/> There they Shine
                        Eternally<lb/><lb/> ("The Caverns of the Grave," 17-20) </q> These
                    mountains rise out of the sea of time becoming the "infinite" and
                    "eternal" mountains, the site of paradise: "the Garden of Eden .
                    . . the golden mountains" (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 28.2), "the mountain
                    palaces of Eden" (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 41[46].3-4).</p>
        <p>The setting of Abraham’s sacrifice and Jesus’ crucifixion leads to
                    the very different image of Albion "slain upon his Mountains / And in his

                        <hi rend="i">J</hi> 59.16). The Tent is the Sky (<hi rend="i">M</hi> 29.4),
                    and the plural mountains reach back to the common mythological idea of a central
                    tent-pole, axle-tree mountain, and four smaller poles making a square around it
                    (the sort depicted, in cross-section, dropping around plates 1 and 21 of <hi rend="i">Job</hi>). The image also evokes "mountainous Wales,"
                    where Albion’s ancient inhabitants fled originally to escape the Saxons,

                    "separated the stars from the mountains: the mountains from Man" (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 17.31). Somewhere in the Druid past, Albion changed
                    "From willing sacrifice of self, to sacrifice of (miscall’d) Enemies
                    / For Atonement," an action, like Abraham’s, located on the
                    mountains. Albion concludes his opening speech in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                    saying: <q> By demonstration man alone can live, and not by faith.<lb/> My

                        ancient camp. Unconvinced himself, he adds, "Blake might really have
                        had in mind Dinas Penmaen, and ancient British fort which could hold twenty
                        thousand men. It was on the summit of Mount Penmaenmawr" (<hi rend="i">A Blake Dictionary: The Ideas and Symbols of William Blake</hi>, rpt.

                        "camp" is that all the others are specific mountains or mountain
                        ranges; but this remains unsatisfying at best.</note></p>
        <p>Blake was evidently impressed by the description in Ezekiel of the sacrificial
                    feast the Lord is to <figure><head>2 Hograth, <hi rend="i">Industry and Idleness</hi>, pl. XI, "The

                    sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink
                    blood;" there "ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till
                    ye be drunken" (29:17, 19). In "the Song" sung at "The Feast
                    of Los and Enitharoom" Blake transfers the action to the mountains
                    themselves—which begin to emerge as solidified giant forms with Biblical
                    histories: <q> [The Mountain <hi rend="i">del.</hi>] Ephraim calld out to [The
                        Mountain <hi rend="i">del.</hi>] Zion: Awake O Brother Mountain<lb/> Let us

                    that "the feast on the mountain of the bodies of the enemy is a
                    transformation of the exchatological picture of the ‘joyous
                    feast’" as in Isaiah 25:6-8. "Possibly," he concludes,
                    "the banquet for the victorious on the mountain and the slaughter-sacrifice
                    of the enemies are one and the same" (pp. 176-77). This duality seems
                    applicable to the Wedding Feast of Los and Enitharmon, since they begin, with
                    Urizen, "Rejoicing <pb id="p14-200" n="200"/> in the Victory" (12.35,
                    E 303, cf. <hi rend="i">J</hi> 4.32 above). Blake’s intertwining vision
                    of the Fall on the mountains of Israel and England follows from his conception
                    of Druid practices and from hints in the Old Testament—unified in an
                    image of "moral" sacrifice on mountains (classical mountains, <hi rend="i">ora</hi>, become m<hi rend="i">ora</hi>l emblems). His first use of
                    the negative power of Old Testament mountains is the figure and setting of
                    "har," the Hebrew for "mountain," in particular, "the
                    mountain" (<hi rend="i">hā-hār</hi>) where Moses received the
                    Law (cf. Clifford, p. 107ff.); as Blake would have read in Bryant: "Har and
                    Hor signify a mountain; ’ópos [oros] of the Greeks."<ref target="n62" type="note">20</ref> So Tiriel first enters "the pleasant
                    gardens of Har" (<hi rend="i">Tir</hi> 2.10)—reminiscent of
                    "Eden the garden of God" located on "the holy mountain of
                    God" (Ez. 28:13-14)—and on his return, "the mountains of
                    Har" (7.19).<ref target="n63" type="note">21</ref><hi rend="i">The French Revolution</hi> imagines "the old mountains . . .

                        ‘mountain’ in Hebrew, the very phrase ‘vales of
                        Har’ is an irony" [?] (E 863); Damon interprets the name and
                        situation of Har as, "He who was a mountain now lives in a vale, cut
                        off from mankind" (<hi rend="i">Blake Dictionary</hi>, p.
                    174).</note></p>
        <p>The Book of Joshua offers the Druid-like image of the Israelites setting up
                    "a great stone . . . under an oak . . . by the sanctuary of the LORD"
                    (25.26) at Shechem, which lies between Mount Gerizim, appointed by the Lord for
                    a blessing, and Mount Ebal, appointed for a curse. Here, in the natural
                    amphitheater of the two mountainsides, Joshua divided the tribes of Israel
                    according to the words of Moses, and while one hears little of blessing, twelve
                    shouted verses beginning "Cursed be . . . " (Jos. 27:11ff.) further
                    illustrate the nature of "barren mountains of Moral Virtue" (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 45[31].19-20; cf. 4.31, above). Jerusalem laments: "The
                    mountain of blessing is itself a curse &amp; an astonishment: / The hills of
                    Judea are fallen with me into the deepest hell" (<hi rend="i">J</hi>
                    79.7-8). A passage repeated in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> shows Tirzah binding down the Human Form crying: <q> Bind

                    tormenting them" (105.28-29 and E 759). "Druid" monuments tend to
                    be associated with Salisbury Plain, but describing his picture "The Ancient
                    Britons," Blake wrote, "Distant among the mountains, are Druid
                    Temples, similar to Stone Henge" (<hi rend="i">DC</hi>, E 536). Blake was
                    following good authority. Borlase’s <hi rend="i">Antiquities . . . of

                    general custom to chuse for their places of worship woods which stood on the
                    tops of hills, and mountains, as more becoming the dignity and sublime offices
                    of their devotions, and of nearer neighbourhood (as they imagined) to the
                    habitations of their Gods."<ref target="n64" type="note">22</ref> Borlase
                    remarks the Old Testament parallels and describes "Karnbrê-hill,

                    "Offerings of Human Life." The general reference is to Tyburn,
                    London’s place of public hangings from as early as 1196 until 1783. By
                    the time they were discontinued, Blake was twenty-six and undoubtedly all too
                    aware of the eager crowds that appeared for each of the eight public
                    hanging-days—indeed, tradition made these public holidays for all
                        journeymen.<ref target="n67" type="note">25</ref> A "Paddington
                    Fair" was a public execution, so called because Tyburn was less than a mile
                    from the village of Paddington,<ref target="n68" type="note">26</ref> in whose
                    parish it was eventually included. There is a visionary continuity joining the
                    Druid monuments, Calvary, and Tyburn: Druid human sacrifices "generally
                    consisted of such criminals as were convicted of theft, or any capital
                    crime" (Borlase, p. 121) and Calvary—as the crucifixion of two
                    thieves with Jesus suggests—was, like Tyburn, a site for the execution of
                    common criminals. <note id="n67"><hi rend="s">25</hi> George Rudé, <hi rend="i">Hanoverian London, 1714-1808</hi>, The History of London

        <p>I am suggesting that the passage from plate 12 of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                    quoted above answers itself: Mild Zion hills most ancient promontory <hi rend="i">is</hi> Tyburn’s fatal Tree ("that" of 1.26). Not
                    because it had particular elevation (it is a mountain of the mind, a mounting of
                    the scaffold), but because it possessed all the attributes of Calvary,
                    succinctly re-summarized by Richard Cumberland in his long poem, <hi rend="i">Calvary; or the Death of Christ</hi> (London, 1792): "Without the city
                    wall there was a mount / Call’d <pb id="p14-201" n="201"/> CALVARY: The
                    common grave it was / Of malefactors" (VI. 440-42). According to one
                    authority the Tyburn gallows was in fact situated "on a small eminence at
                    the corner of Edgeware-Road,"<ref target="n69" type="note">27</ref> which
                    road, together with Park Lane was as late as 1806 the western limit of
                    London’s urbanization and the location of one of its "gates,"
                    the Tyburn Turnpike.<ref target="n70" type="note">28</ref> Lucas van
                    Leyden’s engraving of <hi rend="i">Calvary</hi> shows just how small an
                    eminence can make a mount, or promontory (illus. 1), and Sterne probably
                    reflects the general conception when he has Tristram remark that an altar over
                    sixty feet high would have "been as high as mount <hi rend="i">Calvary</hi>
                    itself" (<hi rend="i">Tristram Shandy</hi>, VII, 5). Blake described his
                    residence at South Molton Street—just blocks down Oxford Street from the
                    old gallows—as located on "Calvarys foot / Where the Victims were
                    preparing for Sacrifice" (<hi rend="i">M</hi> 4.21-22). Significant also
                    was the very instrument of execution. Tyburn Tree was not a gibbet; rather,
                    "The scaffold consisted of three posts, ten or twelve feet high, held apart
                    by three connecting cross-bars at the top."<ref target="n71" type="note">29</ref> It was, in effect, a ruined version of a Druidic temple made of

                        that "The gallows subsequently consisted of two uprights and a
                        cross-beam" (p. 809)—an equally Druidic, if less impressive,
                        structure.</note></p>
        <p>These motifs are illustrated at the bottom of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, plate 4
                    (illus. 3); there a rock-skull emerges from the ground, overshadowed by three
                    trilithons on a mount, reminiscent of the three crosses on Calvary (note
                    Blake’s reference to Calvary on the same plate, quoted above), while on
                    the right the three seem to have joined into a threefold trilithon which
                    suggests a Druid form of the Tyburn gallows.<ref target="n72" type="note">30</ref> One might note also how directly above this structure a spindle or
                    body hangs on high from the end of the line held by one of Blake’s
                    spinner-Goddesses. The rock-skull identifies this scene as Calvary or Golgotha,
                    "which is, being interpreted, the place of a skull" (Mk. 15:22, inter
                    al.). This theme is further developed in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, plate 28,
                    where Albion "sat by Tyburns brook, and underneath his heel shot up! / A
                    deadly Tree, he nam’d it Moral Virtue" (14-15)—the
                    "Tree" here joins the cross, Tyburn Tree (cf. <hi rend="i">OED</hi>,
                    s.v. "tree," B. 4a,b), and the Tree of Good and Evil, complete with a
                    Serpentine form at its base.<ref target="n73" type="note">31</ref> Tyburn, then,
                    is Zion Hills promontory, "most ancient" because all things begin in
                    Albion and this is "‘the most ancient promontory’ of
                    sacrifice" (Erdman, <hi rend="i">Prophet</hi>, p. 475), "the summit of
                    the cosmic mountain and at the same time the place where Adam had been created
                    and buried. Thus the blood of the Saviour falls upon Adam’s skull, buried
                    precisely at the foot of the Cross, and redeems him"<ref target="n74" type="note">32</ref> (illus. 4). The use of the word "promontory,"
                    as Tolley notes, is singular—it serves perhaps to bring in several
                    associations. The promontory is a <hi rend="i">visionary</hi> scene (like the
                    Atlantic mountains of <hi rend="i">America</hi>), a "head-land"
                    offering a vista on the Sea of Time and Space (cf. <hi rend="i">3 Henry VI</hi>,
                    III. ii. 134-36); it is the sterile earth to which Hamlet equates it (II. ii.
                    311); and finally, it is the covering of the fallen mind: in <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> the angelic host defeats the rebels and "on thir
                    heads / Main Promontories flung" (6.653-54; cf. <hi rend="i">J.</hi> 71.55
                    cited below). Ultimately the most ancient promontory is the reader’s
                    skull (Golgotha/Golgonooza), "Once open to the heavens and elevated on the
                    human neck" (<hi rend="i">Eur</hi> 10.28), but now imagining and enclosing

        <p>Los, who is himself an ancient Briton, reaches back to the unfallen state of the
                    mountain imagery, praying "O Divine Saviour arise / Upon the Mountains of
                    Albion as in ancient time (<hi rend="i">J</hi> 44[30].21-22). This image,
                    together with the evocation of "those feet in ancient time / . . . upon
                    Englands mountains green" (<hi rend="i">M</hi> 1), recalls the
                    twice-repeated Biblical praise, "How beautiful upon the mountains are the
                    feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace" (Is. 52:7,
                    Nah. 1:15). Considering the plate geology of relief etching, one could say that
                    Blake’s message also is published on the mountains. The finale of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> presents a vision of "the Sun in heavy clouds /
                    Stuggling to rise above the Mountains" (95.11-12): a struggle, perhaps,
                    because mountains are the "risings" of the earth, the objects of
                    increasing Romantic adoration. <pb id="p14-202" n="202"/><figure><head>4 Albrecht Dürer, "Crucifixion," from the <hi rend="i">Small Passion</hi> (1509-11; 127 × 97 mm.).</head><figDesc>Courtesy of the British Museum.</figDesc></figure><pb id="p14-203" n="203"/> That Sun will rise over different mountains, the

          <p>The dolphin evidently never appears in Blake’s illuminations and only
                        once in his verse, in a line spoken ironically by Bromion in <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> after he has
                        "enjoyed" Oothoon: "And let the jealous dolphins sport around

                        some of its implications let us look briefly at the dolphin symbol and at
                        some exhibits of the Galatea legend in music and art. <note id="n75"><hi rend="s">1</hi><hi rend="i"> William Blake’s Writings</hi>, ed. G. E. Bentley,

          <p>According to Oliver Goldsmith, "The dolphin was celebrated in the
                        earliest time for its fondness to the human race . . . ."<ref target="n76" type="note">2</ref> In classical legend the dolphin was a
                        particular friend to man and often preserved a mortal from drowning, or at
                        least wafted the body to shore for proper burial. The rescue of the musician
                        Arion, for example, had been popularized by Theocritus and Ovid (<hi rend="i">Metamorphoses</hi> XIII.738, ff.) and had been taken over into
                        emblem literature, most recently by Caesare Ripa’s English adapter
                        George Richardson.<ref target="n77" type="note">3</ref> In this extensive
                        literature the dolphin became a symbol of safety and help in time of
                            need.<ref target="n78" type="note">4</ref> From its classical usage and

                        English poets. Both Spenser and Shakespeare referred to the Arion legend

                        mind, doubtless among others, when in "Lycidas" he entreated for

          <p>But why are Bromion’s dolphins "jealous"? In addition to
                        serving as symbols of safety and help, dolphins were also symbols of love.
                        According to Goldsmith, the dolphin was distinguished by the epithet
                        "the boy-loving" (VI, 223). Doubtless Goldsmith had in mind
                        particularly the enamoured dolphin of Hippo whose love for a boy was related
                        by Pliny the Younger in his Epistle IX. According to Ovid and Aulus Gellius,
                        moreover, dolphins were reputed to be very amorous; and they were often
                        depicted as attributes of Aphrodite or Eros. In his <hi rend="i">Metamorphoses</hi> Ovid related that Poseidon changed himself into a
                        dolphin in order to woo Melantho (VI. 120); and according to Spenser,
                        Hippomedes "turnd him selfe into a Dolphin fayre" (<hi rend="i">FQ</hi> III.xi.42.6) in order to win Deucalion’s daughter.<ref target="n81" type="note">7</ref> Even more pertinent for Blake’s
                        purpose, dolphins, according to Ovid (<hi rend="i">Fasti</hi> II.81-82),
                        traditionally assisted lovers. According to legend, a dolphin had discovered
                        the fleeing Amphitrite and had persuaded her to return to her lover,
                        Poseidon; and the grateful seagod had proclaimed the dolphin sacred and had
                        set his image in the heavens in the constellation Delphinus.<ref target="n82" type="note">8</ref> Also, according to Erasmus, a dolphin
                        "rescued the virgin Lesbia with her lover."<ref target="n83" type="note">9</ref> Moreover the dolphin has also symbolized spiritual
                        salvation and Christ the savior.<ref target="n84" type="note">10</ref> The
                        early Christians, for example, often employed the dolphin rather than the
                        fish as a symbol for Christ; and at the Royal Academy Blake may have noticed
                        this symbol as he looked over the treatises on the Roman catacombs. This
                        emblematism might be an additional irony intended by the materialistic
                        Bromion. At least it anticipates the spiritual salvation which Oothoon
                        attains during the course of the poem. <note id="n81"><hi rend="s">7</hi><hi rend="i"> The Works of Edmund Spenser</hi>, ed. Edwin Greenlaw,

          <p>But the dolphin-related legend which most closely fits the situation in <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> is that of the nymph
                        Galatea and her lovers Acis and Polyphemos. When the Polyphemos-like Bromion
                        speaks of "jealous dolphins," he doubtless voices his own
                        possessive view of love as well as that of the mute Theotormon; he
                        attributes jealousy also to any potential rescuer. Though in the Galatea
                        legend Polyphemos is yet to be blinded by Odysseus, he is already blinded by
                        his jealousy, like the spiritually blind Bromion and Theotormon. Moreover,
                        Bromion’s cave, in which we see the bound "adulterate pair"
                        (4.2), may well echo the cave of Polyphemos. The dolphins rescue Galatea
                        from her would-be rapist; they are ironically summoned too late to protect
                        Oothoon. Yet in the final analysis the triumph of Oothoon even exceeds that
                        of Galatea, who is likewise deprived of her lover. Both stories, moreover,
                        are extended laments: as Galatea relates her tragic love story to Scylla and
                        the other nymphs, so Oothoon relates hers to the daughters of Albion.</p>
          <p>Blake and his contemporaries could have been familiar with the Galatea legend
                        from its continued popularity in more than one medium. It was a favorite in
                        English musical drama. It had been developed by John Lyly in 1592 in his <hi rend="i">Gallathea</hi> and revived twice in the eighteenth century,
                        first by P. A. Motteux in 1701, with music by John Eccles, and next by John
                        Gay in 1718-19, with lovely music by Handel. Since the Gay-Handel version
                        was frequently performed from 1777 throughout the rest of the century, Blake
                        could easily have seen a performance.<ref target="n85" type="note">11</ref>
                        In February of 1786 even a ballet version was introduced, at the
                        King’s Theater.<ref target="n86" type="note">12</ref><note id="n85"><hi rend="s">11</hi><hi rend="i"> The London Stage, 1660-1800.</hi> Part V: <hi rend="i">1776-1800</hi>, ed. Charles Beecher Hogan (Carbondale: Southern

          <p>Blake was even more likely to have been familiar with the Acis and Galatea
                        legend in art, especially the pictorial representation of "The Triumph
                        of Galatea," where the dolphins draw her and sport around the lovely
                        maid as she escapes from Polyphemos and turns her lover Acis into a stream.
                        Blake surely knew Raphael’s famous painting of this story, for
                        Goltzius, among others, had engraved it.<ref target="n87" type="note">13</ref> The story had also been depicted by many other artists whom
                        Blake admired: Dürer, Giulio Romano, Nicolas Poussin, several of
                        whose sketches were in Windsor Castle, and by Goltzius himself.<ref target="n88" type="note">14</ref> In some of these versions Polyphemos
                        sits disconsolately, like the jealous Theotormon, on a rock. In one of
                        Poussin’s sketches he actually watches Galatea and Acis having sexual
                            intercourse.<ref target="n89" type="note">15</ref><note id="n87"><hi rend="s">13</hi> Hendrick Goltzius, <hi rend="i">The

          <p>The legend upon which Blake seems to have drawn helps us to focus attention
                        on his theme—the tragic effects of jealousy. Though Blake was
                        doubtless attacking physical as well as spiritual slavery, no hint of any
                        negroid features seems to appear to characterize Oothoon or Theotormon in
                        any of the plates. Their absence and the affinities in the Galatea legend
                        which Bromion’s "jealous dolphins" evoke serve also to
                        emphasize the major theme of possessiveness.</p>

          <p>In his <hi rend="i">Bibliography of William Blake</hi> Sir Geoffrey Keynes
                        made an attempt to identify all of Blake’s designs from which W. J.
                        Linton made his wood engravings for the 1863 edition of Alexander
                        Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake, "Pictor
                            Ignotus"</hi>: in Volume I four full-page cuts (three from the Job
                        series and "Plague") and fifty-six smaller cuts in the text; in
                        Volume II seven small wood engravings in the text.<ref target="n90" type="note">1</ref> Logically assuming from the Gilchrist titlepage
                        statement, "Illustrated from Blake’s own works, in facsimile by
                        W. J. Linton," that all of these cuts (other than those "in
                        photolithography" and the "few" Blake "original
                        plates") were based on, or engraved after, Blake originals, Keynes
                        nevertheless lists ten in Volume I and three in Volume II as unidentified
                        (he ignored the one on page 111 of Volume II)—all rather miniscule
                        chapter tailpieces. In <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon
                        Press, 1977) G. E. Bentley, Jr. makes no comment about Linton’s
                        contributions to the <hi rend="i">Life</hi>, and Robert Essick in his
                        "Finding List of Reproductions of Blake’s Art," <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi>, 5 (1971), 1-160, lists only
                        Linton’s full-page cuts—properly so given the purpose of the
                        list. <note id="n90"><hi rend="s">1</hi> (New York: The Grolier Club, 1921),
                            pp. 328-31. Keynes erroneously lists a Linton cut on II, 1, and II, 2;
                            they are on II, ix (unnumbered page), and II, 1, respectively. The
                            frontispiece of Linnell’s 1827 portrait of Blake is apparently
                            the only engraving not done by Linton: it is by C. H. Jeens.</note></p>
          <p>In my recent research toward an article on Linton and Blake (forthcoming in
                        the <hi rend="i">Bulletin of Research in the Humanities</hi>) I re-examined
                        all of Linton’s contributions to Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life</hi> and have managed to identify all but three of the tailpieces
                        unidentified by Keynes. They form an interesting pattern, one that reflects
                        certain problems Linton had with Dante Gabriel Rossetti over the inclusion
                        in the Gilchrist of photolithographed reproductions of the Job designs. Of
                        the thirteen tailpieces (fourteen including the one on page 111 of Volume
                        II) the sources of which Keynes could not identify, nine are from the border

          <p>Elsewhere in Gilchrist we have Linton’s wood engravings of Job Plates
                        5, 8, and 14 (all full-page, the last excluding Blake’s border

                        From Rossetti’s correspondence with Anne Gilchrist (who had taken
                        over the editing of the <hi rend="i">Life</hi> at the death of her husband)
                        as the volumes were nearing completion, we learn that, despite their plans
                        to include photolithographs of the entire Job series, Linton (who had been a
                        part of the project as early as 1861<ref target="n92" type="note">3</ref>
                        and, one would presume, knew about the photolithography idea) went ahead and
                        executed his own wood engravings of the entire series.<ref target="n93" type="note">4</ref><note id="n92"><hi rend="s">3</hi> On 20 April 1861 Rossetti had written to
                            Alexander Gilchrist to suggest a friend of his to work on the Blake

                            unprovided with a satisfactory copyist (or a sufficiency of such) for
                            the Blakes,—Mrs. Edward [Burne] Jones would be very likely to
                            succeed. This occurred to me shortly after seeing you the other day, but
                            I did not see her till today, when I mentioned the matter to her. I hope
                            I did not do wrong, but she is too intimate a friend to make it awkward
                            for me if you and Linton cannot entertain the idea"—<hi rend="i">Letters of Dante Gabriel Rossetti</hi>, ed. Oswald Doughty
                            and John R. Wahl (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1965), II, 396. This seems to
                            suggest that Linton originally may have planned (or been hired) only to
                            supervise (and/or execute a few of) the engravings for the <hi rend="i">Life.</hi> In any case, nothing seems to have come of the
                            matter.</note><note id="n93"><hi rend="s">4</hi> This is an assumption on my part.
                            Rossetti’s words, in the letter to Mrs. Gilchrist quoted below,
                            are "the <hi rend="i">Job</hi> Plates which he [Linton]
                            copied." It is possible, then, that these plates are the five I
                            have already noted—though Linton’s pillaging of the border
                            design of Plate 12 argues that he did more than five.</note></p>
          <p>It is not clear what led to this confusion, for in February 1863 Linton had
                        written to Rossetti "about the illustrations" and Rossetti had
                        even taken the trouble of visiting Linton to consult with <pb id="p14-209" n="209"/><figure><head>3 <hi rend="i">Job</hi> 12.</head></figure><pb id="p14-210" n="210"/> him about them.<ref target="n94" type="note">5</ref> At about the same time Rossetti received from Mrs. Gilchrist
                        the Job photolithographs which he said pleased him "much—being,
                        though blurry, very full of colour, and not losing perhaps by reduction but
                        getting concentrated in a pleasant way."<ref target="n95" type="note">6</ref> Taken together, these letters suggest that the plan to
                        photolithograph the Jobs was one of long-standing. The only problem with
                        Linton involved a design he engraved for the titlepage, the original of
                        which Rossetti apparently had not seen, for upon receiving it (or, more
                        likely, a proof of it) from Mrs. Gilchrist he returned it to her for some
                        "amendment," saying he would venture "to write a word to Mr.
                        Linton suggesting the removal of the cut, which surely is no facsimile from
                        anything of Blake’s, but a sort of design by some one else."
                        Then, as if doubting his authority, he added a postscript to this letter:
                        "Would you perhaps send the Titlepage on to Mr. Linton—to
                        explain better what I mean."<ref target="n96" type="note">7</ref> But
                        Rossetti, perhaps reinforced by Mrs. Gilchrist in a letter not extant, did
                        nevertheless "advise" Linton to omit "that insane cut in the
                        title page."<ref target="n97" type="note">8</ref> With all this to-do
                        there is no evidence in the letters of Rossetti or Mrs. Gilchrist to suggest
                        any misunderstanding about the Job series. When Linton sent Rossetti the
                        (apparently) final list of illustrations to the volumes, then, and included
                        in it all his copies of the Jobs, Rossetti was in a quandary about what to
                        do with them since the photolithographs were ready to go. He quickly wrote
                        Mrs. Gilchrist: "I see he still includes the <hi rend="i">Job</hi>
                        Plates which he copied, in spite of the photolithographs which might be
                        considered to supersede them."<ref target="n98" type="note">9</ref>
                        What finally emerged is clearly a kind of compromise, Linton no doubt
                        insisting that at least some of his Jobs be included even along with the
                        full photolithographed set,<hi rend="s">10</hi> Rossetti urging Mrs.
                        Gilchrist (in the letter just quoted) that "it seemed a pity to leave
                        them out after the trouble and expense."<ref target="n99" type="note">10</ref> Why all the rest of Linton’s Jobs that were included,
                        piecemeal, as tailpieces turn out to be one, Plate 12, I cannot say. Perhaps
                        that plate was, simply, one of his favorites; perhaps, even more simply, it
                        was the only other one that he actually engraved. <note id="n94"><hi rend="s">5</hi> Letter from Rossetti to Mrs. Gilchrist, dated only

                            project. On 13 December 1862 William Michael Rossetti, who was also very
                            much a part of the Gilchrist <hi rend="i">Life</hi> enterprise, wrote to
                            Mrs. Gilchrist: "I am truly sorry that so much anxiety to you has

          <p>Of the other five tailpieces Keynes could not identify, I can be certain of
                        only one, that on page 269 of Volume I, which is the lower-left figure on
                        the titlepage of <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion.</hi> That
                        on page 160 of Volume I (see illus 4) may be a version (reversed) of the
                        reclining figure in the center of Plate 4 of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, or
                        possibly of the second figure from the bottom right of Job 12, or even more
                        likely to my eye, the figure to the left of the word "Albion" on
                        the titlepage of <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of
                        Albion</hi>—though I have no great confidence in these sources since
                        all of the other tailpieces are exact replicas. For those on pages 304 and
                        367 of Volume I, and 24 of Volume II (see illus. 5, 6, 7), I cannot find
                        even good analogues. Perhaps these last were taken from the excised
                        titlepage design; or they are examples of Linton’s idea of a Blakean
                        figure or design; or they are taken from other of Linton’s own
                        voluminous work (the one on II, 24, for example, is strongly reminiscent of
                        details in several of Linton’s wood engravings for Harriet
                        Martineau’s <hi rend="i">A Description of the English Lakes</hi>,
                        1858). In any case, Linton’s entire role in the Gilchrist project, as
                        well as his own fascinating Blake-like career, deserve considerably more
                        scholarly and critical attention than they have been accorded to date.</p>

          <p>Before "The Dead Ardours Perry" enters the canon of Blake’s
                        writings [see David V. Erdman, "Leonora, Laodamia, and the Dead
                        Ardours," <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 54, Fall 1980, pp. 96-98] and becomes
                        part of the intellectual heritage of the English-speaking peoples it might
                        be of interest for me to describe what I can make of the words on the
                        drawing with it in front of me. To begin with, the letters ‘W
                        B’ on the left are <hi rend="i">below</hi> the level of the disputed
                        text, therefore David Erdman’s assumption that they belong with it is
                        doubtful: more to the point, perhaps, is that the letters ‘W
                        B’ do not look as if they are in Blake’s hand, and they are
                        not in the same type of script as the other text. There can be no doubt
                        about the initial words ‘The dead’ nor, I believe, that they
                        are in Blake’s own formal script, but it is still not even clear how
                        many words follow. I agree with Erdman that ‘bad-doers’ does
                        not work but I would dispute it because there appear to be <hi rend="i">four</hi> letters where he reads the ‘ard’ of
                        ‘ardours’; in fact I see a faint ‘b’ or another
                        letter with a long vertical stroke before his conjected ‘ard’.
                        That final ‘d’ is certain, the ‘ar’ at least
                        possible, in which case we are left with ‘bard’, which makes
                        sense but can only be regarded as a tentative suggestion. The four letters
                        read by Erdman as ‘ours’ may complete the word as he suggests
                        (in which case it would be unlikely to begin with ‘bard’);
                        there could be a hyphen between them and the previous word (as in
                        ‘bad-doers’), or they could form a separate word. What makes
                        it especially difficult is that they seem to have been gone over and altered
                        in pencil, most likely by Blake himself. As for the word read by Erdman as
                        ‘Perry’ it looks very much to me and to others who have looked
                        at it as if it begins with an elaborate ‘l’ and it could end
                        with a ‘g’ and not a ‘y’. I can make nothing of
                        the letters in between. I should also say that it seems very improbable that
                        Blake would have brought in the name of such an obscure engraver in this
                        way, in the same formal script as the title, even if there were other
                        evidence to connect it with the <hi rend="i">Leonora</hi> engravings.</p>
          <p>I am sorry to have thrown the question open again, but anyone who wants to
                        have another try is always welcome to look at the drawing in London. <hi rend="i">David V. Erdman’s response will appear in the summer

          <p>Frank Lentricchia’s study of the last twenty odd years of literary
                        criticism in America, <hi rend="i">After the New Criticism</hi>, should be
                        of interest to any reader of Blake who has been idling "within a
                        structure of higher education where fortresslike walls isolate the various
                        areas of humane learning from one another" (pp. 135-36) and who would
                        like to get briefed on the decade’s coming title fight. The title, as
                        Humpty-Dumpty explains to Alice, concerns "who is to be master,"
                        or, if the reader prefers Obi Wan Kenobi, who is to possess "the
                        force"; and the contenders are the devouring empire of structuralist
                        and poststructuralist criticism, with its annihilating vision of the
                        subject, and Blake, with his prolific, self-annihilated subject. It will be
                        a fitting conclusion (i.e., synthesis into thesis) for a history which
                        begins with "The Place of Northrop Frye’s <hi rend="i">Anatomy
                            of Criticism</hi>," or really even earlier, since Lentricchia
                        reports that readers of "<hi rend="i">Fearful Symmetry</hi> know that
                        that book had forecast the whole of [Frye’s] literary theory as well
                        as the furious rebirth of interest in a problematic writer," and also
                        that, "Its general critical claims aside, the <hi rend="i">Anatomy</hi>
                        gave the Blake revivalists their proper poetics" (p. 4).
                        Lentricchia’s opening round is directed against the conception of art
                        in "apocalyptic humanism" which "reminds us (if ever we
                        needed reminding) of Frye’s Blakean commitments" (pp. 96, 23).
                        That conception surfaces again towards the end of the book, in a discussion
                        of Harold Bloom, where Lentricchia notes "the portentous (and
                        nostalgic) first sentence of <hi rend="i">The Visionary Company</hi>"
                        that when Blake died, "‘the firm belief in the autonomy of a
                        poet’s imagination died with him’" (p. 323). So one may
                        even read Blake into the origin or center (if one for the nonce believes in
                        such things) of Lentricchia’s history and enter the lists for his
                        name’s sake (<hi rend="i">In hoc signes</hi> . . . ).</p>
          <p>"The difficult term ‘history,’" Lentricchia tells us
                        in his Preface, "plays a decisive role" in his argument, which has
                        as one fundamental concern the exploration and critique of the "subtle
                        denial of history" he finds in "vast areas of contemporary
                        criticism." The thrust of this concern appears in the titles of
                        chapters four and five—the book’s most significant sections,
                        and, according to the Preface, the ones which present the author’s
                        perspective most overtly—"uncovering History and the Reader:
                        Structuralism," and "History or the Abyss:
                        Poststructuralism." Lentricchia opposes "conceptions of a
                        ‘history’ which would generate itself as a unity and a
                        totality while resisting <pb id="p14-213" n="213"/> forces of heterogeneity,
                        contradiction, fragmentation, and difference . . . which would deny
                        ‘histories’" (p. xiv). So it would seem we are offered a
                        "histories of criticism," and indeed the first half of the
                        book—"A Critical Thematics, 1957-77"—also devotes
                        chapters to Frye, "Versions of Existentialism," and "Versions
                        of Phenomenology." There is, however, a consistent base perspective
                        worked up out of early Barthes, Jameson, Said, Foucault, and, ostensibly,
                        non-Yale-co-opted Derrida (Lentricchia claims "no originality" [p.
                        xi]) which continually directs us to acknowledge "worldly
                        determinates," "the real state of sublunary nature,"
                        "historical life," "ensnaring relations," "enormous
                        constraints," the "ineffaceable historicity of discourse":
                        "the force that defines and appropriates tradition and knowledge and
                        encloses our cognitive reach within their boundaries" (pp. 10, 24, 26,
                        100, 143, 175, 154). We seem to glimpse this ground in the following
                        discussion of Heidegger’s existentialism, which, says Lentricchia,
                        "is an escape from the real implications of his master metaphor of the
                        world as <hi rend="i">workshop.</hi> For the metaphor demands that the world
                        be placed not in an existential context but within a frame of economic and
                        political power." This statement could be pressed, to follow a common
                        Lentricchian strategy, to an apparent contradiction (ergo, the reader of the
                        book will understand, cognitive nullity): how can the world be placed within
                        one frame? and how do economic and political power dictate a situation where
                        metaphors make demands? As for Heidegger, his metaphoric failure is another
                        indication that his "philosophy is fundamentally nostalgic and
                        world-weary"—an improvement, at least, over Frye’s
                        "thoroughly despairing and alienated understanding of the possibilities
                        of historical life" (pp. 100, 26).</p>
          <p>Lentricchia offers a wonderful mine of summaries and recapitulations which in
                        themselves make his book useful and deserving of our thanks. But since <hi rend="i">After the New Criticism</hi> will stand or fall according to
                        the reader’s response to the conception of history that Lentricchia
                        urges not only for the practice of literary history, but for literary
                        criticism as well, that conception deserves further consideration. In
                        particular, a reader of this journal would want to ask, how would
                        Lentricchia benefit the study of Blake? We are told of "the powerful
                        constitutive forces of the historical process (political and economic
                        contexts, class differences, and so on)" that Culler’s idea of
                        the reader (in <hi rend="i">Structuralist Poetics</hi>) "somehow . . .
                        blocked out," and we are offered for ratification Saussure’s
                        situation of "discourse, literary and otherwise, in its true home in
                        human history" and the concommitant "recognition of the
                        powerlessness of the individual subject, his passive and repressed status .
                        . . and . . . of the vast and frightening force of human collectives to
                        seize discourse for the ends of power" (pp. 111, 119-20). We are asked
                        to approve Lentricchia’s admiration for the early work of Barthes and
                        its conclusion that "‘literary history is possible only if it
                        becomes sociological’" but to reject the "intertextuality
                        or Writing" of the later Barthes as solipsistic fantasies of "a
                        seeker of pleasure in isolation from social, cognitive, and ethical
                        dimensions of selfhood" (p. 145). For the student of Blake, a
                        particularly moving and gripping example of the power of the Foucaultian
                        "discursive formation" to control what is "‘within the
                        truth’ (<hi rend="i">dans le vrai</hi>)" is offered by
                        Lentricchia’s remarks on Frost: <q> . . . if one would not write
                            poetry in a void as did Robert Frost (when he achieved magazine
                            publication only five times between 1895 and 1912, a period during which
                            he wrote a number of poems later acclaimed), then one had better assent
                            to the rules of discursive policy by placing oneself within the confines
                            of those systems that determine biological or poetic truth for
                            one’s time. To refuse to conform is to accept a place, whether
                            one intends to or not, alongside society’s more dramatically
                            visible outcasts: the criminals, the insane, racial minorities, and the
                            indigent, who are brutally and unhesitatingy subjected to the power that
                            divides and silences. (p. 197) </q> Well, Lentricchia would no doubt
                        reprove our presumption, but perhaps we should "commit ourselves to
                        this void, and see whether providence is here also" (<hi rend="i">MHH</hi> 17).<ref target="n100" type="note">1</ref> It is certainly a
                        wonderful irony (unintended or not) to read in this book, published by the
                        University of Chicago Press, that "to be critically <hi rend="i">dans
                            le vrai</hi> in 1980 is to speak under the imprimatur of certain
                        preferred presses and journals" (p. 198).<ref target="n101" type="note">2</ref> This sniping could be continued at length to show how
                        Lentricchia wishes to replace what we might call imagination with the
                        pre-pleasure-seeking Barthes’ conception of semiological systems
                        "put into operation, put into force <hi rend="i">by force</hi>"
                        (p. 132). But for all this, we might remember (as Lentricchia never does)
                        even the supremely privileged Derrida’s observation that "the
                        force of the work, the force of genius, the force, too, of that which
                        engenders in general . . . is the proper object of literary
                            criticism."<ref target="n102" type="note">3</ref> Finally, on the
                        force of Lentricchia’s own historiography, we might note his remark
                        that Foucault’s "naked statement of his goals as a historian is
                        not evidence of what could be (and has been) termed old-fashioned
                        historicist naiveté, but of a passionate belief that genuine history
                        writing is not only possible, but is <hi rend="i">made possible</hi> by
                        Derrida’s revision of traditionalist thought in general and of
                        structuralism in particular" (p. 191, Lentricchia’s emphasis
                        again). Seeing as how Foucault is cited only in translation (indeed, <hi rend="i">The History of Sexuality</hi> seems to have arrived just in
                        time to dominate the "Afterword"), Lentricchia was perhaps unaware
                        of Foucault’s "passionate" and stinging criticism of
                        Derrida and his "system" appended to the second edition of <hi rend="i">Histoire de la folie</hi> (Paris: Gallimard, 1972). The
                        Derridean "revision of traditionalist thought" that Foucault sees
                        is "a petty pedagogy that has been powerfully determined by history,
                        which. . . . teaches the student that there is nothing outside the text. . .
                        . A pedagogy which . . . gives to the voice of the master-teacher that
                        unlimited sovereignty which authorizes its unending retelling of the

                        cited of Derrida’s works in <hi rend="i">After the New
                            Criticism.</hi> As Lentricchia often reminds us, that warhorse (now
                        fourteen years old!) introduced "the structurality of structure"
                        and the concept of "the center . . . the creation of the ‘force
                        of desire.’ In something like an ultimate act of wish-fulfillment,
                        desire attempts to establish the center beyond fictive status as objective
                        reality." Lentricchia adds, "The impact of Derrida on the
                        traditionalist position can be measured most precisely, I think, by his
                        singular success in stirring up that old unmasterable anxiety about the
                        center" (p. 165). Lentricchia rides these concepts far: through Sartre,
                        through Stevens, through "systems of last-ditch humanism" (p. 33),
                        but most effectively when he introduces a quotation from <hi rend="i">Anatomy of Criticism</hi> to show "How uncannily Frye anticipates
                        and, then, crucially rejects" the future Derridean position:
                        "‘Criticism as knowledge . . . recognizes the fact that there
                            <hi rend="i">is</hi> a center of the order of words. Unless there is
                        such a center, there is nothing to prevent the analogies supplied by
                        convention and genre from being an endless series of free associations . . .
                        never creating a real structure’" (p. 14). Frye’s
                        conception of human desire, Lentricchia notes, "causes form or
                        structure to come into being while remaining itself unconditioned by
                        law"; it is "the sure ground, the guarantee of Frye’s
                        ultimate humanism" (p. 15). "Over and over," Lentricchia
                        tells us that Frye tells us, "the literary universe is a representation
                        not of the way things are, but of the ways of human desire" (p. 19). It
                        would be inappropriate to ask Lentricchia what he would do with
                        Blake’s principle that "The desire of Man being Infinite the
                        possession is Infinite &amp; himself Infinite" (<hi rend="i">NNR</hi>b), but we can remark the striking absence from <hi rend="i">After
                            the New Criticism</hi> of any concern for one who has for the last
                        decade presented desire in another perception to the American critical
                        scene, Jacques Lacan (mentioned only once, in passing).</p>
          <p>The second, ante-climactic part of <hi rend="i">After the New Criticism</hi>
                        is devoted to "The American Scene: Four Exemplary Careers." The
                        "subjects" are "Murray Krieger’s Last
                        Romanticism," "E. D. Hirsch: The Hermeneutics of Innocence,"
                        "Paul de Man: The Rhetoric of Authority," and "Harold Bloom:
                        The Spirit of Revenge." One may ponder the fact that two of these
                        critics grappled with Blake in books at the early state of their careers,
                        and a third is reported to have remarked that "Blake was a
                        deconstructor before deconstructionism." Despite some reservations
                        about a "retrograde and anti-intellectual . . . desire . . . to be an
                        original theorist," Lentricchia is most sympathetic to that revengeful
                        spirit, Harold Bloom. And early in his discussion it is remarkable to see
                        Lentricchia become fixated on the idea of "firm belief’ which
                        appears in the opening line of <hi rend="i">The Visionary Company</hi>
                        (cited above, first paragraph). After quoting the line, Lentricchia carps,
                        "Yet . . . only a few sentences after speaking of Blake’s
                        ‘firm belief in the autonomy of a poet’s imagination,’
                        [Bloom] writes of skepticism and discontinuity" (p. 323). Nonetheless,
                        "Bloom’s vacillations aside, what is essential to his romantic
                        line is a full commitment to the mythopoetic imagination. It is a commitment
                        earned (Blake’s ‘firm belief’) only because it takes
                        irony into account and transcends it; a commitment with large extrapoetic
                        sources and implications" (p. 323). Lentricchia does not dwell on the
                        power of his own insight here, but begins the following paragraph with:
                        "Still, the notion of ‘firm belief’ is a redundant phrase
                        which may, and in this instance does, betray subversive perceptions"
                        (p. 324). The student of Blake realizes with a shock that because of
                        Bloom’s indirect reference Lentricchia evidently considers "firm
                        belief" to be one of Bloom’s "Blakean indulgences," a
                        quality he merely "celebrates in Blake" (pp. 343, 325). It is an
                        intriguing comment on influence and anxiety that, through Bloom, Blake has
                        elicited such attention.</p>
          <p>There can, I think, be little doubt as to the absolute value of the work of
                        the two men Lentricchia urges that we "return to," Derrida and
                        Foucault (in that order, it seems). And few will question
                        Lentricchia’s understanding of their sense that they, and we,
                        "are at the end of an era" (p. 208). Yet it is a curiously
                        "undecidable" phenomenon that, in America, the same
                        "discursive formation" that has published Lentricchia, prompted
                        this review, translated Foucault, and summoned Derrida to Yale and
                        California to lecture in English has also ever more strongly brought forward
                        the figure/presence/texts/study of William Blake.</p>
          <q> Then I asked: does a firm perswasion that a thing is so, make it so? He
                        replied. All poets believe that it does, &amp; in ages of imagination this
                        firm perswasion removed mountains; but many are not capable of a firm
                        perswasion of any thing. (<hi rend="i">MHH</hi> 12) </q>

          <p>After laying down rules for textbooks in "Choosing Textbooks for Blake
                        Courses: A Survey &amp; Checklist," <hi rend="i">Blake
                        Newsletter</hi>, 10 (Summer, 1976), 9-26, Mary Lynn Johnson has decided to
                        play the game. The result—the Norton Critical Edition of Blake
                        (edited with John E. Grant)—is one of the best Blake textbooks in
                        print.</p>
          <p>The selections from Blake’s work are well-organized, accessible, and
                        generous, so generous, in fact, that it is easier to list what the editors
                        excerpt (<hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi>, the Notebook, <hi rend="i">The
                            Four Zoas, Jerusalem, A Descriptive Catalogue, A Vision of the Last
                            Judgment</hi>, the Marginalia, and the Letters) than what they include
                        in its entirety (virtually everything else of importance, including <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>). Thirty-two color plates from the illuminated
                        books let students know what they are missing when they concentrate on Blake
                        in print. Numerous monochrome reproductions interspersed throughout the text
                        are less spectacular but still helpful in indicating how Blake designed his
                        work. The prefaces and notes are also useful: their tone is sympathetic but
                        not canonical, their relation to the text about right. They seldom
                        overshadow or complicate the lines that they try to explain; they identify
                        terms and characters without allegorizing them. When the editors make
                        difficult editorial decisions—and with Blake’s punctuation
                        they of course must—they always explain their reasoning and refer us
                        to other sources, especially the editions of David Erdman and Geoffrey
                        Keynes. A chronology, maps of Britain, London, and the Holy Land, an
                        extensive bibliography, a list of key terms with page numbers pointing to
                        definitions and examples in the text, commentary by some of Blake’s
                        contemporaries (Coleridge, Robinson, and Lamb, among others), and several
                        essays by twentieth-century critics—these useful accessories complete
                        the volume. The critical essays, I should add, are adequate, if predictable,
                        including contributions by Northrop Frye, Jean Hagstrum, David Erdman, and
                        Harold Bloom, among others. T. S. Eliot’s "William Blake"
                        and Irene Tayler’s "The Woman Scaly," however, come as
                        pleasant surprises. Eliot introduces a dissenting voice in what threatens to
                        be a chorus of unqualified approval; Tayler takes on one of the most
                        important and least understood issues in Blake—his treatment of the
                        sex roles and sexuality.</p>
          <p>No book is perfect, not even this one. While Blake’s Marginalia is a
                        welcome addition to a book of this kind, the editors’ omission of the
                        passages <pb id="p14-216" n="216"/> to which he is reacting robs many of his
                        statements of their humor, force, and truth. A sentence like "Execution
                        is the Chariot of Genius" sounds like an odd exercise in
                        hyperbole—unless one has been reading Reynolds on execution and
                        genius. The editors rightly note that "Blake could have been a
                        masterful controversialist, or even a heckler," but their presentation
                        of his annotations won’t allow students to discover why. Although the
                        critical essays do not ignore Blake’s drawings—in fact,
                        Hagstrum and Erdman devote a great deal of attention to them—they
                        nevertheless reflect the interests of the literary critics who write them.
                        An essay by an art historian might have placed Blake in art history and
                        revealed what attracts visual artists to his work. Even more importantly, a
                        fuller discussion of Blake’s methods as an engraver would have been
                        useful. Familiarity with these techniques allows us to see Blake’s
                        critical ideas as he saw them—as practical principles anchored in his
                        everyday life as an artist. Finally, many of the critical essays contain
                        page references to Keynes and Erdman which will force the student to get
                        another book or go digging through this one. When possible, the editors
                        should have correlated these references with citations to their own
                        edition.</p>
          <p>But these are minor problems. The highest tribute one can pay to a book like
                        this is to use it, and I plan to in the next undergraduate course I teach on
                        Blake. Or so I dare to hope, for declining enrollments in upper-level
                        literature classes have made such courses rare. Textbooks like this one are
                        consequently in danger of disappearing with small colleges, tenure-track
                        contracts, and other relics of an earlier day. In "Choosing
                        Textbooks" (1976), Johnson could write that "more and more people
                        are preparing to teach Blake for the first time, or teach more of Blake than
                        they did last year, to a growing audience of new readers." Today some
                        of us are hoping to teach him one more time.</p>
          <p>Of course literature textbooks are still published but, I would suspect, at a
                        slower rate. And even many of those books that do see print reflect the
                        limited functions that they now serve. If tested by the needs of students,
                            <hi rend="i">The Oxford Anthology of English Literature: Romantic Poetry
                            and Prose</hi>, for example, would probably fail. Harold Bloom’s
                        introduction explains that "the major Romantic questers, whether we see
                        these as the poets themselves or as the quasi-autobiographical heroes of
                        their poems, are all engaged in the extraordinary enterprise of seeking to
                        re-beget their own selves, as though through the imagination a man might
                        hope to become his own father, or at least his own heroic precursor."
                        The headnote to the section on Wordsworth similarly describes modern poetry
                        as "the poetry of the growing inner self." Although that self
                        "was a Protestant creation," "before Luther it was prefigured
                        in Catholic thinkers as diverse as the furious reformer Savonarola and the
                        meditative Thomas à Kempis, who wrote <hi rend="i">The Imitation of
                            Christ.</hi>" Blake, too, "was primarily an intellectual
                        revisionist, even as Nietszche, Marx, Freud, in the longest perspective,
                        seem most important as revisionists of the European Enlightenment."</p>
          <p>Whatever their other merits, I agree with Johnson that these statements seem
                        out of place in a textbook. Instead of enlightening students, Bloom’s
                        over-writing deepens their suspicion that they are missing out on some
                        mystery that no one will explain—some "extraordinary"
                        affair involving men trying to become their own fathers,
                        "daemonic" intellectual revisionists, and "furious"
                        fifteenth-century Italian monks (the strongest students have looked up
                        Savonarola in their Random House Dictionary). One can imagine the
                        frustration of these students when they confront so many unexplained terms
                        and names—or, more precisely, one has to imagine it because in the
                        absence of courses on Romanticism, <hi rend="i">The Oxford Anthology</hi>
                        never faces this kind of test. Isolation from a classroom audience may
                        explain why so few readers have objected to the book’s insularity.
                        These readers have become professional critics and the book another episode
                        in Bloom’s criticism.</p>
          <p>Constructed with the needs of non-specialists in mind, <hi rend="i">Blake’s Poetry and Designs</hi> is a welcome exception to the
                        trend I have been describing. Either the marketplace is flexible enough to
                        allow the publication of seemingly obsolete books, or this kind of textbook
                        is not yet obsolete. I hope that both possibilities are true. In either
                        case, Grant and Johnson have made it easier (if not easy) for us to teach
                        Blake’s poetry and prose.</p>

          <p>As author of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> and as
                        visionary artist Blake has had a fair amount of attention in Sweden, and
                        individual short poems have been translated. As visionary poet he is less
                        well known outside academic circles, and even <hi rend="i">intra muros</hi>
                        he is certainly not a familiar name to most students. In these days of
                        soaring book prices and some diffidence on the part of publishers it is
                        pleasing that a comparatively small but enterprising firm, Messrs. Bromberq
                        of Uppsala, should have ventured to bring out, beautifully produced, a
                        Swedish translation with parallel English text of <hi rend="i">An Island in
                            the Moon.</hi> In a country with the firmest of beliefs in
                        specialization, it is equally pleasing that the translator-editor is not an
                        Eng. Lit. man but a professor of sinology. Göran Malmqvist of the
                        University of Stockholm is widely known not only as a scholar but also as an
                        assiduous translator of Chinese verse and prose. As these things will
                        sometimes happen, his interest in Blake is said to have been aroused during
                        a visit to Peking.</p>
          <p>For this volume—which includes some well-chosen black-and-white
                        illustrations—Professor Malmqvist provides a lengthy introduction
                        where, with obvious zest and an entirely convincing knowledge of the period
                        concerned and of Blake scholarship, he outlines the intellectual and social
                        background of Blake’s burlesque. It is to be regretted that he did
                        not take time—or perhaps was not granted the space—to say a
                        little more about Blake as poet and artist, the more so since <hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon</hi> provides more than one early glimpse into
                        Blake’s firmly held tenets and, of course, presents not only the
                        way-wardly burlesque songs but also three of the <hi rend="i">Songs of
                            Innocence.</hi> How one wishes that the volume could also have contained
                        the text and translation of, for instance, <hi rend="i">The Marriage of
                            Heaven and Hell</hi>; the Swedish reading public would then have had
                        more of an introduction to Blake’s thought and genius. However, there
                        is every reason to be grateful to Professor Malmqvist, the more so because
                        as translator of an often intriguing text he succeeds excellently, even with
                        those difficult, bafflingly allusive songs.</p>
          <p>He offers an independent, conjectural interpretation of the enigmatic word
                        "wickly" (in Chapter 5) which he translates as if it were a
                        deliberate corruption of "videlicet." It has much to say for his
                        skill as translator that the only passage that leaves him resourceless is
                        Blake’s elaborate pre-Joycean pun, "An Easy of Huming
                        Understanding, by John Lockye, Gent."</p>
          <p>A mock-serious appendix by the translator is one large joke at the expense of
                        the government-imposed <pb id="p14-218" n="218"/> leveling-down tendencies
                        in the Swedish educational system of these latter days. However, as a Swede
                        one feels a slight consolation after having listened to a lecture at the
                        recent I.A.U.P.E. conference in Aberdeen, where Professor George S. Rousseau
                        of UCLA gave his somber view on the lack of interest taken in
                        eighteenth-century literature by American university students. Some of his
                        colleagues from both sides of the Atlantic chimed in, but all showed
                        determination to do something about it. The academic world everywhere is in
                        sore need of daring enthusiasts; Göran Malmqvist is certainly one of
                        them.</p>

          <p>The rise of watercolor painting as an independent art form is intimately
                        connected with the character and fortunes of British art in the decades
                        around 1800. An impressive number of the finest painters of the
                        time—such as John Robert Cozens, Thomas Girtin and John Sell
                        Cotman—chose it as their principal medium. Many other major
                        artists—notably William Blake and J. M. W. Turner—used it
                        frequently and with great originality. In view of this it might be expected
                        that the subject would be given an important place in any study of British
                        Romantic art. Yet on the whole it has tended to be treated as a theme apart,
                        relegated to specialists, most of whom approach it from the viewpoint of the
                        connoisseur. Such commentaries have of course been invaluable in building up
                        our knowledge of the indentity of individual practitioners and for charting
                        the history of the organizations that grew up as the practice of watercolor
                        painting expanded. But they have tended to be less informative about the
                        broader context. There is little treatment of the question of why watercolor
                        should step from its modest position as an ancillary sketching medium (as
                        which it had been used by great masters of all countries since the middle
                        ages) to that of a method suitable for finished pictures. The change
                        involved the development of new attitudes to the study of natural effects,
                        spontaneity and the interest in local scenery, all of which are connected
                        with the emergent Romantic movement. There are social questions as well.
                        Watercolor was a favored medium of amateurs and drawings masters. Not all of
                        these were insignificant figures. John Ruskin is a distinguished example of
                        the former and John Sell Cotman of the latter. But more important than this
                        from a historical point of view is the fact that watercolorists were active
                        in social groups where oil painters had little purchase. Often they cut
                        quite a figure. Thackeray talks of "gay, smart, watercolour
                        painters"; and there are examples in contemporary novels of the impact
                        they could have in the homes of gentlemen.</p>
          <p>Andrew Wilton’s book—which covers the heyday of the British
                        watercolorists—is to some extent aware of these wider issues.
                        However, he is principally concerned with providing a clear and readable
                        account of the leading lights of the school. <pb id="p14-219" n="219"/> The
                        book is based on a series of lectures, and the chapters appear to follow
                        these closely. Each is centered on a major artist (though incorporating
                        thumbnail sketches of associates) and each is of similar length. There is,
                        of course, nothing remiss in publishing lectures. Some of the most
                        attractive and memorable books have been formed in this way. Mr.
                        Wilton’s work has certainly retrained much of the engaging atmosphere
                        of a successful lecture series. But I cannot help wishing that he had made a
                        few more concessions to the more enduring format that his text has now
                        achieved. In particular an introduction would have been welcomed. As it is
                        we are plunged straight into the work of Paul Sandby, "the father of
                        English watercolour," without any preliminaries. At the other end of
                        the book we emerge with Turner and a sharp vertiginous vista of abstractions
                        to come in the twentieth century. An epilogue or conclusion of some kind
                        would, I feel, have been preferable.</p>
          <p>Perhaps Mr. Wilton felt that such formalities could be dispensed with because
                        his perspective on the subject was essentially traditional. Certainly his
                        handling of this viewpoint is an accomplished one. His experiences as a
                        museum curator have been put to very good use in his description of the
                        techniques of individual painters—particularly those who produced
                        landscapes. The author is perhaps best known for the studies he has made
                        into the watercolors of Turner, and the essay in this book provides a fine
                        and concise summation of his views on this topic.</p>
          <p>Mr. Wilton is less at home when dealing with the figurative tradition, and
                        appears to avoid it where he can. We are not reminded of the attempts to
                        make watercolor a vehicle for history painting, although these—as can
                        be seen in the works of Joshua Cristall—were not always disgraceful.
                        When Bonington is discussed, more interest is shown in his landscapes than
                        in his historical sketches. Most of the figurative work
                        discussed—such as that by Rowlandson and John Frederick
                        Lewis—can be fitted into the general theme of the observation of
                        nature and interest in topography. There is only one who
                        cannot—William Blake.</p>
          <p>Blake is hardly likely to fit comfortably into any general survey of British
                        art of the Romantic era. Here he stands out, not only because his subject
                        matter is so radically different from that of the other watercolorists, but
                        also because his view of watercolor itself seems to be different. He
                        certainly used watercolor a lot—more, in fact, than any other
                        painting medium—but he is definitely not within the British
                        watercolor tradition. For him it was principally a designing medium, as it
                        had been for the great European masters before him. He produced many
                        beautiful works treated in a highly original manner, most notably the Dante
                        illustrations with their touches of pure color. But he would rather have
                        been at work on frescos, if circumstances had allowed. Despite this Wilton
                        tries to make watercolor the focus of his career, even going so far as to
                        characterize his color printing as "another manifestation of his
                        inventive use of watercolour."</p>
          <p>Blake’s position does pinpoint a problem within the book as a
                        whole—the degree of commitment to watercolor as a medium felt by the
                        artists under discussion. Some made it their career, some used it
                        sporadically for convenience or as a means of making preparatory studies.
                        Wilton treats both categories equally without discussing the distinction.
                        Thus Constable—who was no enthusiastic watercolorist—is given
                        the same billing as such masters of the medium as Girtin, Cotman and Turner.
                        This also leads to the discussion of much material that seems extraneous to
                        the history of watercolor in the case of those artists for whom the
                        technique was not a ruling passion.</p>
          <p>There is, however, much that is attractive about the book. Apart from the
                        readability of the text, there is also the selection of plates. This is far
                        from being a simple rerun of classics—although some of the most
                        breathtaking examples (such as Girtin’s "White House") have
                        properly been included. It brings to light many little known
                        gems—such as W. H. Hunt’s "Little Girl Reading." The
                        biographies of the artists and notes on the plates are highly informative.
                        So much so, in fact, that it seems a shame that this section could not have
                        been extended, and a broader introduction provided by the main text.</p>

          <p>In about 1810, Blake called upon "Englishmen" to "rouze
                        yourselves from the fatal Slumber into which Booksellers &amp; Trading
                        Dealers have thrown you Under the artfully propagated pretence that a
                        Translation or a Copy of any kind can be as honourable to a Nation as An
                            Original."<ref target="n104" type="note">1</ref> This appeal has
                        been so thoroughly answered by twentieth-century collectors, connoisseurs,
                        and curators as to overthrow completely the aesthetic of the last two
                        centuries which highly valued reproductive graphics. The triumph of original
                        printmaking has transformed our sense of what to value in prints and, less
                        happily, has tended to obscure the importance of copy engraving as the
                        predominant form of the craft throughout Blake’s lifetime. The recent
                        exhibition, <hi rend="i">Painters and Engraving</hi>, at the Yale Center for
                        British Art was a worthy and generally successful attempt to restore a more
                        balanced historical view and investigate—but not necessarily
                        advocate—the values of the reproductive print. <note id="n104"><hi rend="s">1</hi> "Public Address" in David V. Erdman, ed.,
                                <hi rend="i">The Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi> (Garden
                            City, New York: Doubleday, 1965), p. 565.</note></p>
          <p>The 150 works in the exhibition, including a few paintings accompanied by
                        their graphic translations, were displayed with appropriate restraint on the
                        third floor of the handsome new Yale Center. All the prints were fine, early
                        impressions and for the most part in excellent condition. Many of these
                        works were originally intended for the collector’s portfolio or
                        display in intimate domestic settings, and thus I had to compensate for the
                        public and institutional context of the exhibit by moving from print to
                        print and studying each at close range. Rich burr, mossy tints, and clean
                        strokes must be appreciated at a distance not to exceed twenty inches. A
                        scholarly exhibit of this type never draws the crowds swarming over the MOMA
                        Picasso fiesta on the same weekend I visited the Center. Left frequently
                        alone, except for an occasional guard who feared I was fogging up the
                        glazing, I could study the prints with considerable convenience. Three
                        visits of about two hours each made for a calm and decorous experience with
                        a proper eighteenth-century balance of delight and instruction.</p>
          <p>The exhibition had a narrow focus, for it dealt not with the full range of
                        reproductive printmaking in England from c. 1720 to c. 1830 (as the
                        sub-title implies), but rather with the specific field of prints copied
                        after paintings executed as finished works in their own right. Further,
                        almost all of the prints were based on eighteenth or early
                        nineteenth-century British paintings, and book illustrations were generally
                        excluded. This field was in turn divided into fourteen sections. Reciting
                        them is a bit tedious, but an efficient way of giving a sense of the
                        exhibit’s contents and an outline of the history of
                        eighteenth-century English copy engravings after paintings. <list type="ordered"><item><p><label>1.</label> Hogarth and His Predecessors (Le Blon, J. B.

                        for rendering oil paintings into repeatable images, dominated the exhibit.
                        All were highly competent and representative examples, but the long rows of
                        mezzotint portraits and genre scenes showed how regularity and the extreme
                        of high finish can grow into monotony. The more exciting mezzotints were
                        those after paintings with Caravaggesque light effects, such as Philip
                        Dawe’s plate of 1768 after Henry Robert Morland’s "The
                        Ballad Singer" (both painting and print exhibited) and the great plates
                        by Green, Earlom, and Pether after Wright of Derby’s "A
                        Philosopher Shewing an Experiment on the Air Pump," "The
                        Blacksmith’s Shop," and "The Farrier’s Shop."
                        For one as lodged in Blake and his circle as I, it was a slight
                        disappointment not to find in the exhibit some of the striking mezzotints
                        after Fuseli, such as J. R. Smith’s "Belisane &amp; Percival
                        under the Enchantment of Urma" (1782) and "The Weird Sisters"
                        (1785).</p>
          <p>Although no works by or after Blake were in the show, it did offer an
                        excellent chance for experiencing at first-hand the context of styles and
                        techniques in which, and often against which, Blake pursued his own unique
                        course as a printmaker. Blake’s natural allies were Woollett and
                        Strange, the great practitioners of traditional line engraving who opposed
                        the newer schools of mezzotint, crayon manner, stipple, and aquatint. That
                        he attacked these two men, at least in his private <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> jottings of c. 1810, and set his own career within an
                        older tradition of original graphics, shows the extent of his
                        dissatisfaction with the aesthetics and economics of the printmaking
                        industry represented in this exhibit. In his earlier years, Blake seems to
                        have been more willing to channel his talents into conventional copywork.
                        His major source of employment throughout his career was book illustration,
                        but some of his separate plates would have fitted comfortably into the Yale
                        exhibit. Blake’s two plates of 1782 after Watteau, "Morning

                            cotta,<ref target="n106" type="note">3</ref> are typical of the stipple
                        plates presented in section 8 of the exhibit. Ryland’s
                        "Maria" after Angelica Kauffmann (no. 76 in the exhibition
                        catalogue) and Bartolozzi’s "Presentation of King John of France
                        to Edward III" (no. 84) are very close to Blake’s work. If the
                        two extant productions ("Zephyrus and Flora" and
                        "Calisto," both after Stothard) by the partnership of Blake and
                        Parker are representative of their intentions, then in 1784 the two former
                        apprentices of James Basire were attempting to produce and market prints
                        that met the contemporary demand for delicately stippled "fancy"
                        prints. A few years later, Blake even became involved in the highly popular
                        business of producing stipple prints after George Morland’s
                        picturesque views of country life. "The Industrious Cottager" and
                        "The Idle Laundress," both originally published by J. R. Smith in
                        1788, are of the same genre as J. D. Soiron’s two plates after
                        Morland, "St. James’s Park" and "A Tea Garden" of
                        1790, exhibited at the Yale Center (nos. 85 and 86). Soiron’s plates,
                        like three extant impressions of Blake’s prints after Morland,<ref target="n107" type="note">4</ref> were printed in colors <hi rend="i">à la poupée</hi>—that is, with each color of ink
                        individually applied to the appropriate areas of the copperplate with a rag
                        dabber or stump brush and printed in one operation.<ref target="n108" type="note">5</ref> Blake’s own color printing of the illuminated
                        books appears to have been an extension of this technique to relief plates
                        and a substitution of opaque glue or gum-based pigments for colored inks.

          <p>The Yale exhibit included two important painter-printmakers, Barry and
                        Stubbs, whose work is legitimately a part of reproductive engraving, since
                        their prints were copied after paintings, but who are also in the tradition
                        of original graphics because the paintings they "copied" (and
                        frequently altered) were their own. Blake shared much with these artists who
                        also took singular approaches to the execution and publication of their
                        designs "without the intermediary of engraver and publisher."<ref target="n109" type="note">6</ref> In his early years Blake seems to have
                        had the intention of preparing a series of designs on subjects from British
                        history, and later on Biblical subjects, for eventual execution as
                        copperplate line engravings. From this resulted only the "Edward and
                        Elenor," "Job," and "Ezekiel" separate plates and
                        perhaps "The History of England, a small book of Engravings" known
                        only through their advertisement in the 1793 prospectus "To the
                            Public."<ref target="n110" type="note">7</ref> This pattern for an
                        artist-printmaker was established by Barry, whose "King Lear and
                        Cordelia" (nos. 102a and 102b in the exhibit) represents his energetic
                        approach to the copper. Prints on historical and literary subjects were the
                            <pb id="p14-222" n="222"/> most respected, having the same position in
                        graphics as the epic in the hierarchy of literary genres, and
                        eighteenth-century decorum called for their execution in traditional line
                        etching/engraving. Barry and Blake set their sights on this lofty field;
                        neither achieved the popular and financial successes of the painters West
                        and Reynolds or the copy engravers Woollett and Strange. Further, Barry
                        tended to experiment with inking and printing techniques to such an extent
                        that each impression is unique. This divergence from the uniform
                        repeatability sought by the established printmaking industry was carried to
                        an extreme in Blake’s relief etchings and color printed drawings.

          <p>Given his explicit admiration for Barry,<ref target="n111" type="note">8</ref> the parallels between Blake’s career (or at least his
                        early intentions for it) and his predecessor’s are not surprising.
                        The associations between Blake and Stubbs come less readily to mind,
                        particularly given the differences in the subjects of their prints other
                        than large felines. The Yale exhibit, however, makes their general
                        relationship clearer. Godfrey tells us in the catalogue that "no prints
                        are less spontaneously executed than those of Stubbs, whose delight it was
                        to patiently rework and rethink for the graphic medium an image that he had
                        already defined in paint, perhaps decades before" (p. 46).
                        Blake’s career after 1804 shows this same tendency, for he returned
                        to his early plates to revitalize "Job," "Ezekiel,"
                        "The Accusers," "Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of
                        Albion," and "Albion rose" with new cutting, burnishing, and
                        insciptions. And Blake seems to have fiddled with "Chaucers Canterbury
                        Pilgrims" and <hi rend="i">The Gates of Paradise</hi> into his last few
                            years.<ref target="n112" type="note">9</ref> The great <hi rend="i">Job</hi> plates have a very high finish in their central panels,
                        display some of the minute flick and stipple work to create rich and varied
                        textures so typical of Stubbs’ plates, and are reworkings of designs
                        Blake executed almost twenty years earlier for Thomas Butts. Like Barry and
                        Blake, Stubbs also "manifested to a remarkable degree that natural
                        delight in purposeful technical experiment."<ref target="n113" type="note">10</ref> When viewed from this special perspective offered
                        by the Yale exhibit and catalogue, one might even begin to speak of the
                        "School of Barry, Blake, and Stubbs." There are of course
                        significant differences among them, but all three artists struggled against
                        the modes of sensibility and production dominating late eighteenth-century
                        printmaking. Their works embody that unity of conception and execution so
                        much a part of Blake’s aesthetic and of our modern taste in graphics.
                        Certainly Blake’s major attempt at producing a large engraving after
                        one of his paintings, "Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims," would have
                        fitted nicely into the Stubbs and Barry section of the Yale exhibition. It
                        is surprising that the organizers did not take advantage of available
                        resources to do this: across the street at the Yale University Art Gallery
                        they would have found Blake’s original copperplate of the
                        "Canterbury" and an impression of the rare third state.<ref target="n114" type="note">11</ref> The Center itself has a good
                        impression of the second state and, for contrast and context, a fascinating
                        etched proof (yet with inscriptions and an imprint, dated 1 August 1810,
                        indicating it was published) of the Schiavonetti-Heath plate after
                        Stothard’s "Canterbury Pilgrims" painting. <note id="n111"><hi rend="s">8</hi> See the annotations to Reynolds (Erdman, pp.

          <p>A scholarly exhibition deserves a good catalogue to perpetuate its memory and
                        extend its impact beyond the lucky few who attended the show. Although the
                        physical appearance of the catalogue authored by Alexander and Godfrey is
                        not very promising, with few illustrations and typewriter typography, their
                        double-column text is packed with valuable information, some of it taken
                        from previously unpublished letters and engravers’ receipts. Although
                        not the focus of any one section of the catalogue, the class struggle
                        between engravers and painters—the latter always asserting their
                        superiority to the former yet desperately needing their talents—is
                        clearly documented. The conventional entries on individual works are
                        preceded by an introduction by Alexander, brief descriptions of printmaking
                        techniques by Godfrey, and a most informative overview by Alexander of how
                        eighteenth-century prints were published. The second of these sections
                        offers interesting material on the use of drypoint (hard to detect in
                        eighteenth-century plates because the burr was always removed before
                        printing) and on the sale of unfinished proofs, but also raises a few
                        doubts. Godfrey calls woodcut a "planographic process" (p. 8).
                        Surely it is relief; the first planographic technique was lithography, and
                        even that was a relief technique in its early history in England. Godfrey
                        also states that the etching ground was wax, the usual method of biting the
                        plate was to build a dike of wax around its edges and pour acid into the
                        shallow vessel formed thereby, and the most common mordant was dilute nitric
                        acid or the "Dutch Bath" of hydrochloric acid mixed with chlorate
                        of potash (p. 7). All three observations are subject to question. The
                        eighteenth-century etching manuals in French and English recommend the
                        "soft varnish" which indeed contained "virgin wax"
                        (i.e., purified beeswax) but also asphaltum and other substances.<ref target="n115" type="note">12</ref> Pure wax would be too soft and would
                        probably drip off the plate if one tried to smoke it with a candle. Blake
                        used the dike method for biting his relief plates; but the handbooks give
                        equal if not more attention to a slanted palette, with a trough at the
                        bottom, on which the plate was placed and acid poured over it, and to the
                        "Cochin Rocker"—an acid-filled tray in which the plate was
                        gently rocked back and forth to keep the acid moving and thereby prevent
                        bubbles that cause underbiting and lifting of the ground. To support his
                        reference to the dike method, Godfrey refers to item 9 in the exhibit, a
                        print from <hi rend="i">The Universal Magazine</hi> of October, 1748,
                        showing (among other printmaking activities) a copperplate resting in an
                        acid bath tended by a young boy with a feather to whisk away bubbles. This
                        scene is even more disconcerting to me than it should have been to Godfrey,
                        for I have never found an eighteenth-century description of etching that
                        recommends this procedure, now standard in an age without cheap apprentice
                        labor to pour acid or rock trays. Perhaps it is only a Cochin Rocker
                        temporarily at rest and the boy a lazy apprentice. Finally, the standard
                        mordant was probably Abraham Bosse’s so-called <hi rend="i">aquafortis</hi>, a mixture of vinegar, sal-amoniac, sea salt, and
                        verdigris. Only Dossie (II, 146-50) objects noisily to this mordant and
                        writes that true <hi rend="i">aquafortis</hi> is nitric acid. None of the
                        manuals I have seen says anything of the Dutch Bath, although Bosse’s
                        formula has a similar combination of acids and salts and in my experience
                        bites copper in a <pb id="p14-223" n="223"/> similarly gentle, non-bubbling
                        manner. But these technical matters seem to be subject to endless dispute,
                        and I suspect that neither Godfrey nor I have heard the end of it. <note id="n115"><hi rend="s">12</hi> See William Faithorne, <hi rend="i">The

          <p>The catalogue, like the exhibition itself, is worthy of its institutional
                        sponsor. I hope that the Yale Center and its guardian angel, Mr. Paul
                        Mellon, will continue to serve scholars in specialized fields, such as
                        English copy engraving, where few other museums or libraries can afford to
                        labor. These efforts will surely add to Yale’s reputation as a center
                        for the study of British art and culture.</p>

                        of human desire and its vicissitudes, Romanticism would seem to demand
                        exactly the kind of illumination a psychoanalytic approach offers. On the
                        other hand, perhaps nothing is more effectively and meaningfully hostile to
                        the idealizations of Romanticism than the characteristic demythologizing
                        force of Freudian analysis; the psychoanalytic description of the neurotic
                        is often a telling negative portrayal of the Romantic hero. Indeed,
                        Freud’s work can easily be seen as both the culmination of a century
                        of Romanticism and a reaction against it. For the literary critic who finds
                        psychoanalytic models valid and compelling and who is at the same time
                        intellectually and emotionally sympathetic to Romanticism, the problem is to
                        bring Romanticism and psychoanalysis together in a way that respects both.
                        Such a project, exemplified in the work of Harold Bloom, Thomas Weiskel,
                        Richard Onorato, and others, seems to me the most important recent
                        development in Romantic studies.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Blake, the problem is especially difficult. First, Blake
                        offers an abundance of diverse Romantic attitudes; his characters include
                        both "good" and "bad" Romantics: the Sunflower, Thel,
                        Orc, Oothoon, Los, the Devil of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>, the
                        poet’s own persona at different moments, even Urizen constitute
                        together a virtual encyclopedia of Romanticism. Blake’s poetic
                        universe is powered and pervaded by a general Romanticism, a desire for
                        paradise; and his on-going poetic adventure centers upon his attempts to
                        refine and shape that desire. It is easy for psychoanalysis to help Blake
                        criticize the negative Romanticism, but how is it to handle the positive?
                        Second, Blake’s own systematic charting of the psyche, precisely
                        because it has numerous points of similarity to Freud’s, is a
                        formidable defense against attempts to apply psychoanalytic models to his
                        work. And sure enough, most psychoanalytic references in Blake studies show
                        how Blake embodies or anticipates Freud’s theories, rather than how
                        psychoanalytic techniques of interpretation can open up an unconscious
                        dimension in Blake’s own words. A third difficulty is that Blake does
                        not lay himself bare, like Wordsworth, who virtually begs to be analyzed. As
                        compatible as Blake may be thematically with an ethic of subjectivity and
                        self-expression, poetically he belongs primarily to an older, more openly
                        literary tradition; he is a writer of calculated guises, of ironies and
                        dramatizations.</p>
          <p>Simon Stuart’s <hi rend="i">New Phoenix Wings</hi> is a psychoanalytic
                        study of literature that respects poetic idealization (customarily
                        identifying idealization with sentimentality and falsification, the author
                        writes, we tend "to pass over that area in which an idealised view can
                        penetrate an essential reality") and that includes an extensive chapter
                        on Blake. Stuart’s approach is based on the striking and <pb id="p14-225" n="225"/> controversial work of Melanie Klein, whose
                        theories have been highly influential in England, more so than in the United
                        States. Klein believed that infants in their first six months experience
                        toward the object that dominates their lives, the breast, not only positive
                        feelings but also intense feelings of aggression, and she identified these
                        sadistic impulses with the death-instinct. Culminating during the experience
                        of weaning, the aggression is expressed primarily in unconscious destructive
                        fantasies (the derivatives of which can be observed later) toward the
                        internalized image of the breast, as well as the internalized image of both
                        parents. Furthermore, in his fantasies of hatred and assault, the infant
                        fears that the object of his fury will retaliate in kind. This is the
                        paranoid-schizoid stage, schizoid because of the conflict between the
                        satisfying, pleasure-giving image of the breast and the frustrating, hostile
                        image of the breast. It is the persecuting inner object, rather than actual
                        parental discipline, that for Klein is the source of the Superego.</p>
          <p>Tormented by fears both of his own aggressive impulses and of the persecuting
                        enemy those impulses have created, the infant enters a stage of severe
                        depression, in which he is dominated by a sense of loss. But the depression
                        is countered by the growing realization that the external parents do not
                        behave like the internal fantasy parents, that despite his own aggression
                        and the sadism of the internal parents, the external ones still remain
                        loving. The infant is then moved to rebuild his inner world, which has been
                        shattered by sadism, and he passes into a stage of reparation, dominated by
                        fantasies of healing the damaged parents. This impulse of reparation, Stuart
                        emphasizes, is the source of art; to create is to recreate, to rebuild the
                        lost or fragmented internal object.</p>
          <p>Crucial to the process of reparation is a new ability to form symbols,
                        substitutes for what the infant has lost. In Klein’s treatment of
                        sublimation, when the image of the breast becomes over-whelmingly fraught
                        with conflict and anxiety, the infant forms a symbolic substitute for it;
                        the anxieties of the depressive stage thus drive the subject to sublimations
                        which, ideally, resolve the anxieties, leading to new interests and
                        activities. In this way, the death-instinct becomes the power behind the
                        creation of "life-enhancing, life-preserving activities." The
                        alternative to reparation and symbol-formation is stultification,
                        pathological withdrawal, impotence of all types; "We must construct our
                        symbols," writes Stuart, "or die."</p>
          <p>Stuart examines these issues in the work of a mythopoeic poet, Blake; a
                        subjective, confessional poet, Wordsworth; a novelist, Dostoevsky; and a
                        dramatist, Shakespeare. But first he explores Kleinian patterns in less
                        sophisticated forms, in nursery rhymes and in compositions written by his
                        own sixth-form students. This chapter—for me, the best part of the
                        book—features an engaging discussion of his method of teaching
                        "Goosey, goosey gander." From the innocence of children’s
                        literature, he moves to Blakean Innocence and Experience, juxtaposing
                        "A Little Boy Lost" to a student fantasia about a homosexual rape
                        on an altar by a father-priest, to show the Oedipal intricacies within
                        Blake’s theme of religious and social oppression. But where is the
                        reparation in this poem? It appears, Stuart claims, in the spectrum of
                        colors surrounding the poem on Blake’s illuminated plate, a
                        covenantal rainbow, which both recalls the lost oneness at the source of the
                        spectrum and also is emblematic of the restitution made by aesthetic form
                        itself. The latter point becomes a major theme in the book. Whereas comic
                        literature manifests reparation in both content and form, tragic literature
                        does so purely in form. For Freud, the formal properties of literature offer
                        a kind of forepleasure, which bribes us to accept the author’s
                        fantasy. For Bloom, concentrating on the writer, rather than the audience,
                        formal properties, as ratios of misreading, are aggressive transformations
                        of a prior text. For Stuart, we experience a feeling of reparation in our
                        appreciation of rhyme, meter, sound, and verbal patterning. Successful
                        poetry doesn’t incite us to fulfill the forbidden impulses it takes
                        as its subject matter but transports us to a state of Thomistic
                        contemplation of aesthetic wholeness and universal meaning. For Stuart,
                        formal elements embody the Ego’s ordering of "crude Id
                        impulses"; but he typically underplays the magical fantasy involved in
                        that ordering. Formal elements can often be seen as rooted in primal
                        experiences and impulses; the Thomistic stasis can be regarded as a
                        reincarnation of the infant’s experience of the good object; it may
                        also be that some need for obstacle, resistance, or counter-pressure enters
                        into the artist’s own experience of form: witness Frost and his
                        tennis net. In different ways, Vico, Buber, and Northrop Frye have pointed
                        out that magic, fantasy, and, in effect, Id impulses play a part in the
                        process of poetic structuring, as well as in the material to be structured.
                        In any event, Stuart does not convince me that "A Little Boy Lost"
                        is not, in the terms of Stephen Dedalus’ Thomistic aesthetic,
                        primarily a pornographic poem, one which is calculated to incite us to
                        outrage, one in which the function of aesthetic form is to sharpen the
                        point.</p>
          <p>Stuart’s major section on Blake begins with a reading of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> Night VIIa as an account of the origins of the
                        creative imagination. The Night opens with the Oedipal entanglements of Orc
                        and Urizen, in which it becomes clear that no hope for redemption can any
                        longer be expected from the Id, hero of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> but
                        now as crippled as the Superego that oppresses it. The world of Orc and
                        Urizen is the paranoid-schizoid world, ruled by the death-instinct. A way
                        out can be found only through Los, or the Ego, but only if the Ego accepts
                        the annihilation of its current, limited concept of itself as a wholly
                        conscious, rational entity by acknowledging its own "forgotten, denied,
                        split off, despised aspect," and especially its envy and jealousy,
                        prime Kleinian effects in the early phases. The Spectre of Urthona, who both
                        represents the despised aspect and argues for its acceptance, receives a
                        more favorable presentation in Stuart than I have seen elsewhere. Once Los
                        is inwardly healed, he turns with Enitharmon to the reparative work of
                        creating "embodied semblances," or symbols, <pb id="p14-226" n="226"/> for the other spectres of the fallen world; that is, Los and
                        Enitharmon become the good internalized parents cooperating in the process
                        of creation, rebuilding the world shattered by Orc and Urizen and by their
                        own depressive anxieties, and the world of symbols they build is Golgonooza.
                        In the vision of the Lamb of God clothed in Luvah’s robes of blood
                        that enteres the episode at the end and that Anne Mellor has attacked as a
                        conventional religious intrusion, Stuart sees an effective symbol of the
                        process of reparation, in which the dead spectres, the shattered pieces of
                        the world, are reborn; the Lamb is, in effect, a culminating symbol of the
                        process of symbol-formation itself.</p>
          <p>All this may sound somewhat formulaic, but it is much less so in
                        Stuart’s text than in my synopsis, and so far I find it a fine
                        reading. At this point, however, Stuart makes the claim that Blake himself
                        fails to achieve in the poetic form of VIIa the embodied semblance, the
                        process of giving structure to the broken, that in his narrative is
                        presented as the triumph of the life-instincts. Indeed, he relates
                        Blake’s epic style to the infant’s sense of omnipotence,
                        which, as a manic defense against depression, is an obstacle to true
                        reparation. In <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, he concludes, Blakean form
                        becomes even looser and more narcissistic; and he similarly censures <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> for its embodiment of a
                        world-view and a poetics dominated by mere magic and an exaggerated sense of
                        the worth of all the individual’s products. Blake is at his best, by
                        contrast, in the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, where he is writing in tight,
                        traditional forms, shaping his impulses in the terms of a larger, anterior
                        enterprise (he calls "A Little Boy Lost" a "great
                        poem"). This is a stunningly retrogressive point, and T. S.
                        Eliot’s strictures on Blake, as well as his general aesthetic, are
                        brought back to life to support it. Working with categories of Ernst Kris,
                        Stuart develops opposed concepts of the artist as craftsman and as magician,
                        the latter equated with the "bad artist" and the neurotic, and
                        writes that the presence of the Romantic, inspired, and prophetic Bard
                        "vitiates" many Blakean passages. At such times Blake lacks
                        "classical impersonality."</p>
          <p>Stuart’s aesthetic categories and sympathies are remote from his
                        Blakean material. Organic form has its abuses and failures—so too
                        does classical or "traditional" form, as Blake was fond of
                        pointing out—and Blake did not entirely escape such failures; but I
                        doubt if Stuart’s argument will give much pause for reconsideration
                        to anyone who is convinced that Blake’s epic style was a conscious,
                        artful expansion of form accompanying and even necessitated by an expansion
                        and deepening of statement and vision. More important, Stuart’s sense
                        of tradition is limited, for the epic style is indeed quite traditional; it
                        belongs to a tradition of prophetic poetry, which has its own formal
                        features and which includes the Bible and <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>,
                        Blake’s favorite books. There are references in Stuart that imply a
                        partial acknowledgment that Blake’s epic style is traditional in its
                        own way; but if a psychology of art is truly required by its principles to
                        reject an entire tradition of style that writers themselves have found
                        useful throughout the history of literature, then the psychology needs to be
                        revised. We may accept that certain powerful and skillful works of art
                        exemplify narcissistic, omnipotent, and magical conceptions of the self and
                        the world—however, we then might question not whether such art is
                        therefore rendered invalid but, as Bloom has done, whether poetic excellence
                        is the same thing as the wisdom of daily life. Romantic magic and
                        imagination and the character of the Romantic poet-prophet require a cooler
                        psychological analysis than Stuart gives them.</p>
          <p>Stuart proceeds to analyze the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> as successful embodied
                        semblances. He reads the "Introduction" to <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> attractively as a poem that represents the poetic
                        process in terms of conception (piping down the valleys wild), gestation
                        (from piping to singing to writing), and birth (the child, at first inside
                        the piper, with the cloud above his head as both a placenta and a
                        thought-bubble, vanishes when the song is externalized in a book).
                        Procreation and poetic process are identified with incarnation, since the
                        child, the song, the song’s subject (the lamb), Innocence, and, by
                        implication, Jesus are jointly conceived and brought into the world in the
                        poem. In "The Little Boy Lost" and "The Little Boy
                        Found," dew and mire represent both the material world, into which, in
                        a Neoplatonic reading, the soul descends, and also the urine and feces of
                        the child’s assault against the parents. Losing involves destroying.
                        But the real parents, as opposed to the inner ones, continue to be ever nigh
                        and caring, and reparation is achieved. It would appear that since the new
                        father is a sublime one (God) the concept of reparation needs to be
                        supplemented here by the concept of Family Romance.</p>
          <p>"The Chimney Sweeper" of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> receives the
                        most provocative of these readings. The essence of the poem for Stuart is
                        not its social protest but its portrayal of the inner experience of
                        oppression. The shaving of Tom’s head is castration; cleaning
                        chimneys and sleeping in soot is an "anal diversion" opposed to
                        the genital strivings expressed in the dream of rising to the clouds. Tom
                        learns to endure temporarily an onslaught of the death-instinct without
                        being emotionally destroyed by it; his genital potency remains inviolate
                        despite the attacks on it. But a fuller reading would have to account for
                        the element of pathetic rationalization in the poem, as well as the fact
                        that the sweeps’ entering the chimneys implies active homosexuality,
                        not passive like the altar fantasia to which Stuart compares the poem. We
                        can expand upon Stuart’s reading as follows. First, the poem begins
                        with the death of the mother; that is, when the child is weaned, he enters a
                        state of persecution. The poem ends with the promise of phallic liberation;
                        in the meantime, the child under-goes a severe detainment at the anal stage.
                        Second, while cleaning other people’s chimneys might well be,
                        symbolically, the nadir of humiliation, it could also represent a
                        destructive homosexual assault against the father; latent aggression appears
                        within the portrayal of helpless suffering. Third, in Klein the child is
                        fascinated by the contents of the mother’s body, which in his
                        fantasies include other children, penises, and excreta (in the paired poem
                        the child himself is "a little black thing," a piece of soot), and
                        the anus is frequently in the child’s fantasies the place of birth;
                        the sweeps thus enact <pb id="p14-227" n="227"/> the epistomophilic and
                        destructive fantasy of entering the mother’s body, exploring it, and
                        robbing (liberating) its contents, while they also suffer the retaliatory
                        fantasy of being swallowed and destroyed by that body, assimilated to the
                        fragments of dirt within it, locked in coffins of black. But the liberation
                        of the sweeps, the resurrection of the dead, is also a bringing forth of
                        life from excrement, which Irvine Schiffer in <hi rend="i">The Trauma of
                            Time</hi> describes as one of the radical fantasies of the artistic
                        process. The poem thus gives us a comprehensive vision of psychic conflict
                        in the mode of anality; but it goes even further to merge psychology and
                        social criticism, suggesting how a concept of reparation can be exploited
                        and how symbol-formation, in the transcendent genital paradise, can be
                        overly drastic. If the child behaves well under the oppressive regime, he
                        will be rewarded after death. In this poem, the life-instinct, having
                        transformed the death-instinct, is then subtly co-opted by its
                        adversary.</p>
          <p>For Stuart, Innocence and Experience represent not childhood and maturity but
                        the idealized breast and the persecuting breast, "the two contrary
                        states of the human soul." While the <hi rend="i">Songs of
                            Innocence</hi> are set in the stage of depressive anxiety and typically
                        conclude in reparation, the <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi>
                        paradoxically focus on the earlier paranoid-schizoid stage, which does not
                        contain the potentiality of reparation; here the life-instinct, with its
                        conversion of disintegration into beauty, is present in poetic form alone.
                        In "The Sunflower" Stuart sees the obverse of the successful
                        process of creation he discerns in "Piping down the valleys wild."
                        He reconciles the apparently contradictory impulses dramatized in the poem
                        toward sexual fulfillment and transcendence by arguing that sexual desire is
                        treated in Blake as the "symbolic enactment of a quest which supersedes
                        it . . . erection [is the image] of resurrection." He expands upon this
                        by reference to Donne’s "The Ecstasy," in which, as Stuart
                        has it, a psychosexual reality appears behind the concepts of Platonic Ideal
                        and Christian Incarnation and in which soul and body find a saving
                        reciprocity; in Stuart’s reading, "as the physical uses the . .
                        . immaterial for physical ends, so the immaterial must use the physical for
                        ends transcending the physical." "The Sunflower" records a
                        failure to understand the relation of the physical to the spiritual, a
                        failure, then, of symbol-formation, of incarnation. This is a good reading,
                        but to understand the uniquely Blakean treatment of the relationship between
                        the physical and the spiritual, one would have to take into account, first,
                        Blake’s theme that the visionary is not a separate realm from the
                        bodily (as in Plato and orthodox Christianity) but an expansion of the
                        bodily, and, second, a psychological, as opposed to thematic, analysis of
                        Blake’s deeply complex attitudes toward sexuality, woman, and
                        nature.</p>
          <p>Stuart’s Wordsworth chapter is clearer and smoother than his Blake
                        section, not only because the material is more readily amenable to his
                        approach but even more because his discussion here actually begins with a
                        psychological analysis of the poet’s text rather than with a concept
                        of the poet’s work (the transcendent Blake) to which a psychological
                        analysis is, in effect, adapted. Chiefly interested in the way Wordsworth
                        can "transform the substance of despair into creativity," Stuart
                        asks how the poet can claim that such traumatic Oedipal episodes as the
                        stolen boat scene in <hi rend="i">The Prelude</hi>, Book I, ultimately
                        contribute to his growth and sense of well-being. Onorato’s answer
                        (still the best one for me) is that Wordsworth’s imagination is
                        driven by a need to deny traumatic effect, specifically that caused by his
                        parents’ deaths; but according to Stuart, Wordsworth’s
                        earliest experience, his pre-Oedipal innocence, his internalization of the
                        good parents, is so firm and positive that the later conflicts of Experience
                        can be not only survived but used to enriching effect. "So feeling
                        comes in aid / Of feeling . . . if but once we have been strong." It is
                        in this way that looking back at the past restores us. What also helps
                        Wordsworth survive the depressive stage is his genius for symbol-formation.
                        In his treatment of the Spot of Time in which Wordsworth visits the
                        murderer’s gibbet, Stuart shows how anxiety drives the poet from
                        symbol to symbol in a series of sublimating equations—from the
                        visionary dreariness of the childhood landscape to the golden glow perceived
                        by the adult returning to the scene, for example, or from the letters of the
                        murderer’s name (torn bits of the mother’s body) to the girl
                        with the pitcher to "the loved one by my side." The capacity to
                        fabricate embodied semblances in this way resolves the anxiety and leads to
                        authentic growth.</p>
          <p>Stuart also compares "Tintern Abbey" and the "Intimations
                        Ode" as, respectively, an unconvincing and a successful attempt to
                        resolve depressive anxiety over the loss of the good object. In
                        "Tintern Abbey" anxiety and aggression are magically denied; the
                        sense of persecution that emerges in other depressive passages—in,
                        for example, Wordsworth’s reflections on the Reign of
                        Terror—is smothered beneath "The still, sad music of
                        humanity." In the Ode, however, the source of depression is faced: the
                        child perversely destroys his own happiness and integrity; we "provoke
                        . . . the inevitable yoke." Such an acknowledgment validates the
                        poem’s movement from depression (the thought of grief, forgetfulness)
                        to reparation (the timely utterance, remembrance).</p>
          <p>In the final chapter it becomes apparent that Stuart’s ultimate
                        purpose is the forging of a synthesis of psychoanalysis, art, and religion,
                        and it is on the third term that he now concentrates. Apparently sharing the
                        yearning of Eliot for rites and symbols that are grounded in human reality
                        and psychologically developing that desire, he looks through Christian myth
                        and ritual to its pagan roots and, beyond, to the inner events of depressive
                        mourning for the lost object and restitution, "an eternal rhythm of
                        death and resurgence, impotence and potency, destruction and
                        reparation." Both art and, in its symbolic rather than magical aspect,
                        religion embody "the struggle of the life-instincts to find forms to
                        celebrate their ever recurrent mourning of what is lost and rediscovery
                        thereby of new life." He analyzes structures of rebirth in <hi rend="i">Crime and Punishment</hi> (studying the relation between Raskolnikov
                        and Svidrigailov) and <hi rend="i">Much Ado About Nothing</hi>, adding, in
                        the latter case, a touch here <pb id="p14-228" n="228"/> and there to
                        previous discussions of rebirth in Shakespearean comedy: Hero is the
                        destroyed and restored object; Don John manifests the infant’s
                        envious wish to spoil the power and greatness of the good object; the
                        renunciation of self-sufficiency and superiority that brings Beatrice and
                        Benedick together has its roots in the infant’s relinquishing of the
                        breast, a renunciation that is the basis of enriching sublimations. But the
                        center of the chapter remains the quest for an effective symbol, "a
                        hyper-verbal communication [that] may resort to words," as the soul
                        does to the body in Donne, but that is finally a transcendent reality.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">New Phoenix Wings</hi> demonstrates that the important work of
                        Melanie Klein is worth the attention of students of literature; and Stuart
                        is not a mere mechanical adapter of her theories but a reader whose approach
                        to literature does show fineness and subtlety. His style, however, despite
                        some eloquent passages is too often an obstacle: for example,
                        "‘Introduction’ with ‘Earth’s
                        Answer’ <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>, like Coleridge’s <hi rend="i">Dejection</hi> or Wordsworth in <hi rend="i">The Prelude</hi>
                        I, records the disjunction of that bisexual process without the temporary
                        conjunction of which the record could not exist." In his argument
                        Stuart does not, in my view, use psychoanalytic criticism to maximal effect,
                        tending to use it to open up a writer’s vision of humanity and to
                        demonstrate in general terms the Creative Process at work rather than to
                        open up our vision of the particular sensibility constituted by the
                        writer’s words. Did the creative process have precisely the same
                        meaning for both Blake and Shakespeare? Are the anxieties and the implicit
                        attitudes toward parental images revealed in their texts identical? Except
                        in the case of the openly subjective Wordsworth texts, I miss a sense of the
                        individual inflection of the universal process.</p>
          <p>It may be that different followers of Freud bear a special relationship to
                        different authors. Ferenczi seems close to Wordsworth, for example, and the
                        heretical Jung has been successfully used in conjunction with many writers
                        in the romance mode. In Klein, the handling of aggression and its conversion
                        into creativity is central. I would like to see Kleinian analyses of writers
                        as divergent as Pope—with his aggressive satire, his virtually
                        magical concern with form and craft, and perhaps his enemy-parents, Dulness
                        and Tibbald-Cibber—and Shelley—with his massive
                        transformations of aggression and his Prometheus devastating the world
                        through Jupiter and then rebuilding it. As for Blake, anger and aggression
                        certainly figure saliently in both his style and his poetic situations. But
                        because of Stuart’s bias against the epic work, <hi rend="i">New
                            Phoenix Wings</hi> doesn’t fully answer the question of
                        Klein’s relevance. What about the study of jealousy and the battle
                        against the death-instinct (Covering Cherub, Selfhood, Error, Satan) in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>? What about the bringing together of the parents
                        (Milton and Ololon, Albion and Jerusalem) that dominates both <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>? Here, far more than in the
                            <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, would come the test of Klein as a guide to
                        Blake. I am grateful to Stuart for provoking such questions, and I do think
                        his book makes a contribution to Blake studies. Still, it is important to
                        observe how psychoanalysis can be used merely to give formidable authority
                        to anterior aesthetic judgments. Here, surrounded by references to Eliot and
                        Donne and by a Thomistic concept of form, Blake is subsumed into a poetic
                        and religious tradition alien to his own, with predictable results in terms
                        of aesthetic evaluation. Stuart has brought Blake and psychoanalysis
                        together by taking him out of the Romantic, visionary line of English
                        literature; more than analyzing Blake’s Romanticism, he has
                        eliminated it.</p>
          <p>A broader issue is the exact nature of the voyage from impulse and experience
                        to symbol and art. In Freud, that voyage involves a sacrifice; this is
                        reaffirmed by Lacan. In Bloom, art is not a reparation for aggression, but
                        aggression itself is at the source of the creative process; and in Bloom,
                        too, denials and defenses are generators of the poetic imagination. Does
                        poetry start with a reparation for a catastrophe or with the catastrophe
                        itself? Throughout <hi rend="i">New Phoenix Wings</hi> Stuart stresses that
                        in reparation the internal parents are recreated and brought together in
                        sexual union; artistic creation involves an internally bisexual process, in
                        which male and female elements, father and mother, are married. We might say
                        that while in the paranoid-schizoid stage the infant suicidally destroys his
                        own creators, in reparation he recreates himself by affirming his origins;
                        he inwardly repeats his own creation. This is Coleridge’s Primary
                        Imagination, the "repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of
                        creation in the infinite I AM." <hi rend="i">New Phoenix Wings</hi> has
                        much to offer on this phase of the poetic process. What it lacks is a vivid
                        complementary account of the Secondary Imagination, which "dissolves,
                        diffuses, dissipates, in order to recreate," in which aggression plays
                        a role and the subject seeks not to repeat his origins but to remake them,
                        even, in the most highly Romantic formulations, to be his own creator. For
                        such an account, we would have to pass from reparation to the Oedipus
                        Complex and the Family Romance.</p>

                            and the Sublime</hi>, a major loan exhibition exploring the relationship
                        of J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851) to theories of the sublime, will open at the
                        Yale Center for British Art on Wednesday, 11 February 1981.</p>
          <p>The sublime as an aesthetic concept has been discussed by numerous writers,
                        and Turner’s own interest in the theory, as propounded in the
                        eighteenth century by Edmund Burke and others, has often been noted. But
                        Turner, far from being bound by any theoretical conceptions, used these as
                        the starting point for a whole series of technical and artistic innovations.
                        In pursuit of the sublime, Turner made many very large watercolors which
                        emulated the grandeur and importance of oil paintings. Several of these,
                        together with their no less impressive full-scale preparatory studies, will
                        be included in this exhibition, some being shown for the first time. The
                        most significant of Turner’s paintings in the genre of the sublime
                        will be represented by fine impressions of prints, often engraved under the
                        close supervision of Turner himself.</p>
          <p>This exhibition, the first to examine a specific aspect of Turner’s
                        art, will include 123 watercolors, prints and drawings executed between 1793
                        and 1845. Of these works, sixty constitute an unprecedented loan from the
                        resources of the Turner Bequest, deposited in the British Museum in London;
                        in addition, a sizable number of works come from the Center’s own
                        holdings, and others from private collections.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Turner and the Sublime</hi> has already received considerable
                        attention at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto where it opened on 1
                        November 1980. After closing in New Haven on 19 April 1981, it will travel
                        to the British Museum in London where it will be on view from 15 May through
                        20 September 1981.</p>
          <p>The 192-page catalogue accompanying the exhibition, published by British
                        Museum Publications and available at the Center’s Sales Desk,
                        includes 32 color plates and 108 black and white reproductions. Written by
                        Andrew Wilton, a leading authority on Turner watercolors and Curator of
                        Prints and Drawings through December 1980, the catalogue discusses
                        Turner’s training and early career in the light of traditional
                        attitudes to the sublime and considers the mature Turner’s use of
                        them for his own needs.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Shakespeare and British Art</hi>, an exhibition bringing
                        together for the first time the University’s extensive holdings of
                        Shakespearean art, will open at the Yale Center for British Art on Thursday,
                        23 April and remain on view through Sunday, 5 July 1981.</p>
          <p>William Shakespeare was one of the most important literary inspirations for
                        British artists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Nearly 1400
                        works based upon scenes or characters in his plays were shown at the Royal
                        Academy exhibitions between 1769 and 1900. One of the most significant
                        events in the development of an English School of history painting was
                        Josiah Boydell’s <hi rend="i">Shakespeare Gallery</hi>, a group of
                        paintings, illustrating the plays of Shakespeare, which were commissioned in
                        the last quarter of the eighteenth century and engraved for subscription.
                        Illustrated editions of Shakespeare’s works proliferated, especially
                        during the nineteenth century when over three hundred were in print.</p>
          <p>This exhibition surveys the literary and visual sources of Shakespearean
                        illustration, from the first illustrated edition of 1709 to Victorian
                        interpretations of this theme. It draws on the large collection of
                        Shakespearean material in the British Art Center, including a number of
                        paintings from the Boydell <hi rend="i">Shakspeare Gallery</hi> and others
                        of important eighteeth century actors in major roles, such as Benjamin
                        Wilson’s <hi rend="i">David Garrick and George Anne Bellamy as Romeo
                            and Juliet</hi> and Pieter Van Bleeck’s <hi rend="i">Mrs. Cibber
                            as Cordelia.</hi> Nearly thirty paintings and over 120 drawings and
                        prints from the Center’s collection will be on view. Among the
                        artists represented by important drawings and watercolors are Francis
                        Hayman, George Romney, Henry Fuseli, Richard Parkes Bonington, Francis Danby
                        and Frederic Lord Leighton. The Lewis Walpole Library in Farmington,
                        Connecticut will be lending five watercolor drawings by H. W. Bunbury as
                        well as fifteen engravings. Finally, a number of prints and rare,
                        illustrated editions of Shakespeare from the collections of Beinecke Rare
                        Book and Manuscript Library and Sterling Memorial Library will be on
                        display.</p>
          <p>The exhibition has been organized by Geoffrey Ashton, Librarian of the
                        Garrick Club and former resident fellow of the British Art Center, who is a
                        specialist in theatrical and Shakespearean art. It will be accompanied by a
                        catalogue with 110 illustrations and detailed entries on all 190 objects in
                        the exhibition.</p>
          <p>In conjunction with <hi rend="i">Shakespeare and British Art</hi>, the Center
                        will offer a range of special programs. On Friday, 24 April at 4 p.m., The
                        Lord Annan, Vice-Chancellor the the University of London, will deliver a
                        lecture, sponsored by the British Studies Program, entitled "How Should
                        We Produce Shakespeare?" On Saturday, 25 April from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30
                        p.m., there will be a symposium, <hi rend="i">Shakespeare in the Eighteenth
                            and Nineteenth Centuries.</hi> Topics under discussion will include: the
                        relationship of Shakespeare’s plays to visual depictions of them, the
                        importance of Shakespearean drama as a subject for art, and performances of
                        the bard’s works during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The
                        program will feature the following talks:</p>

              <hi rend="b">"BLAKE AND THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY" AT THE 1980
                                MLA</hi>
            </title>
          </head>
          <p>That the 1980 MLA Special Session on "Blake and the Eighteenth
                        Century" was probably the longest such meeting of the convention does
                        not alone explain the fact that the audience seemed to increase rather than
                        diminish in numbers during the presentation of the four papers and a
                        response. This was an eternity in love indeed with its temporal productions.
                        Leo Damrosch, Jr. spoke first on "Blake and the Recovery of the
                        Lyric," arguing that Blake "recovers" the lyric through poems
                        "totally committed to meaning in its deepest sense" and that the
                        fullness of this commitment is what separates Blake most decisively from the
                        tentative lyric poetry of the eighteenth century. But at the same time, it
                        is this "total moral commitment to works of art that point beyond
                        themselves" that leads to Blake’s later work and its concern
                        with "the gap between what art claims and what it can perform."
                        Jim Borck offered an illuminated discussion of "Blake and the
                        Topography of the Human Imagination," and suggested that
                        "Blake’s interest in London corresponds to other contemporary
                        interests in anatomy texts and cartographic developments during his
                        life." Blake "must transform the landscape from which his map has
                        been drawn, an external re-mapping which will cause distinctly new interior
                        maps to spring forth"—in particular, the London that Blake
                        "wishes to re-construct is an artistically remapped London based upon
                        anatomical details." Jim’s illustrations pointed to
                        Vesalius’ <hi rend="i">Fabrica</hi>, an important anatomical text, as
                        a source for the poses of some Blake figures. In "UnLocking
                        Blake’s Crystal CabiNet," Tom Vogler related some of the
                        significant details and the poetic argument of that poem to Blake’s
                        understanding and detestation of Lockean epistemology and metaphysics.
                        Referring to Barker’s famous Panorama of 1787 and to Bentham’s
                        proposed Panopticon, Tom characterized the speaker of the poem as one who
                        has entered "the tower of observation, or the Lockean stage of
                        self-reflection, in which he can see himself seeing, while we see him seeing
                        himself and describing what he sees." Here, however, "the power of
                        observation does not unlock the epistemological prison but rather
                        constitutes it and expands it." The speaker’s attempt to
                        "‘seize the inmost Form’ reveals that there is <hi rend="i">nothing</hi> there that can be seized, perceived, or
                        comprehended by natural vision." In his remarks on "Classical Line
                        and Romantic Identity," Morris Eaves argued against the recent tendency
                        to use Blake’s favorite aesthetic opposition—line vs.
                        color—to align him with artistic neoclassicsm and eighteenth-century
                        attitudes toward art. For Morris,
                        "Blake—characteristically—reestablishes Enlightenment
                        principles on romantic grounds. In the case of artistic line, he shears off
                        certain conventional associations (of line with reason and nature, for
                        instance), retains others (of line with intellect), and adds still others
                        (of line with imagination). The result is a thoroughly romantic cluster of
                        metaphors." The Session closed with a response in the spirit of true
                        friendship from Stephen Carr; addressing each of the preceding papers,
                        Steve’s meta-critical effort attended to some characteristic problems
                        of placing Blake within standard categories and sequences of literary
                        history. "Reading Blake forces us to explore, to question, and in <pb id="p14-231" n="231"/> some sense to deconstruct received categories and
                        methods of literary history and criticism . . . consequently a first stage
                        or gesture in approaching this topic is to subject ourselves to a much more
                        rigorous scrutiny than is usually the case." As the four papers and the
                        response wonderfully demonstrate, we still have much to learn about Blake
                        and the eighteenth century.</p>

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>In his review of G. P. Tyson’s book on Joseph Johnson G. E. Bentley
                        noted that the publication of a list of Johnson’s imprints would be
                        of value to Blake Scholars.</p>
          <p>Readers may be interested in knowing that such a list has been completed by
                        Leslie F. Chard, Professor of English at the University of Cincinnati.
                        Professor Chard describes the list as follows. The list contains over 2800
                        imprints (4800 separate entries when counting multiple editions) by some
                        1100 authors. Many of these imprints and authors probably influenced Blake;
                        many of course are already known to have done so. More broadly, the list
                        will help us understand more clearly the intellectual climate in which Blake
                        worked.</p>
          <p>The list has also been computer analyzed, so that students of the book trade
                        in Blake’s time can learn a good deal of firm information about the
                        intricacies of publishing. This, too, should shed some light on Blake,
                        notably in his dealings with publishers as an engraver.</p>
          <p>If any of the readers of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> would like to make
                        preliminary inquiries about the contents of the list before it is published,
                        Professor Chard would be happy to assist them.</p>
