        <p>Joseph Holland, formerly of New York, Los Angeles, and Santa Fe, died on December 28, 1994. With his friend Vincent Newton, Joe formed a small but impressive collection of original prints and drawings by Blake, supplemented with standard bibliographies, editions, and criticism. Both men attended the legendary A. E. Newton auction in 1941, where Joe purchased a color-printed and richly hand-colored impression of <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> pl. 22 from copy B of <hi rend="i">A Small Book of Designs</hi> (illus. 2) and one of only four known impressions of the tailpiece (pl. a) for <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience.</hi> Other treasures in the collection included a good, uncolored impression of <hi rend="i">Little Tom the Sailor</hi>, once in the W. E. Moss collection, and two Visionary Heads. A fine Shakespearean actor, a founding member of the Mercury Theatre with Orson Welles, and a true lover of Blake, Joe Holland will be deeply missed by all those fortunate enough to have known him.</p>
        <p>The sale of the Newton collection was handled by John Windle Books of San Francisco, now the world’s leading dealer in Blake and Blakeana. The resulting catalogue 26, issued in December 1995 as a memorial to Joe Holland and entitled <hi rend="i">The Blake Collection of Joseph Holland &amp; Vincent Newton</hi>, is the most impressive Blake sales catalogue issued by a book or art dealer (as distinct from an auction house) since the Quaritch Blake lists of 1885-86. The catalogue also includes many volumes and a few prints from sources other than the Holland collection and a retrospective listing of important works by Blake acquired by Windle for private clients over the last few years. All the lots of original Blake materials actually offered for sale are included in the listings below.</p>
        <p>To have the Holland color print of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> come on the market is a signal event. To have two further prints also from copy B of <hi rend="i">A Small Book of Designs</hi> become available in the same year is enough to make a Blake collector’s head spin. The design only from <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> pl. 3, color printed and delicately hand tinted, appeared on the auction block at Christie’s London on 25 April (illus. 1). My own pre-sale guess was that the print would fetch bids well beyond the estimate range of £30,000-50,000 and would very probably be won by the American private collector who, over the last 15 years, has amassed an outstanding collection of Blake’s illuminated prints (for a tentative handlist, see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 27 [1994]: 104). I was wrong as to both price and purchaser. Although this anonymous collector knew of the sale, she/he failed to bid. Indeed, there seems to have been only one bidder in the room—Windle, acting on behalf of the artist and author Maurice Sendak. Windle apparently bid only against the reserve—that is, the price (in this instance, probably £25,000) beneath which a lot will not be sold—and won the print at just £28,000 (with the addition of the purchaser’s premium, £32,200).</p>
        <p>The third color print from the <hi rend="i">Small Book</hi> copy B, the Leviathan from <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> pl. 20, appeared at Sotheby’s London less than three months later (illus. 3-5). Windle was once again the winning bidder at £32,000 on an estimate of £20,000-30,000. But this time, Windle was acting for Essick rather than Sendak. The underbidder (that is, the party with the bid just prior to the winning bid) was an anonymous presence on the telephone. The long captions to illus. 2 and 3 offer some speculations about how these and other prints in the <hi rend="i">Small Book of Designs</hi> were produced. The captions to illus. 3-4 record the sad history of the Leviathan’s mistreatment over the years; illus. 5 presents its restoration.</p>
        <p>The sale of all three prints from either the <hi rend="i">Small</hi> or <hi rend="i">Large</hi> books of designs still possessed by individual collectors—excluding three still in the Keynes Family Trust, but destined for the Fitzwilliam Museum—prompted me to make a rough survey of all original Blakes remaining in private ownership. Absent a deaccession by an art museum or institutional library, only such works, plus new discoveries, are likely to come on the market. I have of course excluded commercial book illustrations and such relatively common prints as the Job, Dante, and Canterbury Pilgrims engravings, but I have included all drawings and paintings, illuminated prints, manuscripts, texts first printed in letterpress in Blake’s lifetime, and the rarer separate prints designed and executed by Blake. These I have grouped by medium and genre, in accord with the perceptions of the market as to the relative value of (for example) paintings versus pencil sketches, or prints versus water colors.</p>
        <p>The Visionary Heads constitute by far the largest category of Blake’s work still in private ownership. All 50 sheets still in the Larger Sketchbook are privately owned, along with 20 sheets from the dismembered and dispersed Smaller Sketchbook and 28 miscellaneous sheets, for a total of 98 examples. Some of these are counterproofs and many are rather faint or slight. Barring the discovery of a large cache of unrecorded works by Blake, the Visionary Heads should appear on the market more frequently than anything else of interest to Blake collectors and scholars.</p>
        <p>If we exclude the Visionary Heads, the list of drawings in private hands shrinks dramatically: 30 pencil sketches, four in pen and ink, 30 monochrome wash drawings, and 30 water colors (including 10 from the great series of Bible illustrations Blake sold to Thomas Butts). Tempera paintings are rarer still, with only nine still privately owned. We should also expect a few of the once-recorded but now untraced drawings and paintings—in all, 184 listed by Butlin—to turn up over the decades and eventually make their way to the marketplace.</p>
        <p>There are 32 privately-owned detached leaves from Blake’s illuminated books, but only 19 complete (or near-complete) copies printed by Blake himself. Posthumously-printed copies are rarer, with only four still owned privately. The “untraced” category again offers the collector some hope: eight copies printed by Blake, two posthumous, and 38 individual leaves.</p>
        <p>Separate prints must be divided into several different categories. As previously mentioned, there are only three privately-owned prints from the <hi rend="i">Small Book of Designs</hi> copy B. There are three further illuminated-book plates probably printed as separate prints by Blake (as distinct from those printed for inclusion in books) and still in private hands. All but three of the

Collection of Maurice Sendak. For comments on this impression, and reasons for believing that it is the second of three pulls from the plate, see Martin Butlin, “Another Rediscovered Color Print by William Blake,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 27 (1993/94): 68 (verso drawing reproduced, with an enlargement of the print reproduced on the journal’s cover). The breast, visible beneath the left shoulder and apparently gendering the figure as female, was not printed but added during hand coloring.<lb/><lb/>
The illustration presented here began as a 4 × 5 inch color transparency. This was digitalized at the Huntington Library and printed as a black and white glossy image. Those interested in the relationship between purely photographic and photo/electronic media may wish to compare this illustration with the two accompanying Butlin’s essay. For some general observations on the production history of <hi rend="i">A Small Book of Designs</hi>, copy B, see the captions to illus. 2 and 3.

large color prints, conceived and first executed in 1795, are in institutional collections. (Scholars interested in Blake and numerology should begin working at once on the numbers three and 30). Uncolored but important separate plates are rare: three impressions of “Joseph of Arimathea Among the Rocks of Albion” (all second state) still privately owned, two impressions of the “Enoch” lithograph, one of two traced impressions of “The Chaining of Orc,” one of two known impressions of the “Laocoön,” six second-state prints of “The Man Sweeping the Interpreter’s Parlour,” and nine impressions of “George Cumberland’s Card.” The unique impressions of “The Man Sweeping” (first state), “Deaths Door” etched by Blake himself in white line, and the relief etching of four Virgil illustrations remain in private ownership.</p>
        <p>Only six of Blake’s letters are still privately owned, but there are some 37 once recorded but now untraced. It is difficult to count other sorts of Blake manuscripts; all but one (the Riddle Manuscript) among those in private collections are inscriptions on drawings or prints included in the accountings above. Ironically, the rarest genre of all is Blake’s writings printed in conventional type during his lifetime—just one copy of <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi>, plus one untraced.</p>
        <p>My survey prompts a few general conclusions. A good deal of original Blake materials will appear on the market for years to come. We will see for sale more Visionary Heads than any other type of drawings or paintings, other sorts of drawings more than important individual prints, individual prints and single plates from the illuminated books more than complete books, and illuminated books more than lifetime letterpress volumes. Parts of this declining scale of potential availability are the reverse of what one would normally expect of an artist/poet—for example, that drawings are much more common than lifetime letterpress publications. Only a very few examples of Blake’s finest work—the kinds of things we can all see in the Tate or Fitzwilliam or Huntington—will be within the reach of future collectors, no matter how wealthy.</p>
        <p>Besides Windle’s most impressive contribution, two further dealers’ catalogues devoted to Blake and his circle deserve special notice. Adam Mills Rare Books continued its recent interest in Blake with a June “Occasional List” devoted to eight Muir facsimiles (including <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> executed completely by hand without a lithographic base), the 1877 Pearson uncolored facsimile of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (mis-identified as an Andrew Chatto publication), the hand-colored issue of the E. J. Ellis 1893 facsimile of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>, and a few odds and ends. Prices were steep, with the Pearson facsimile offered at £800 and Ellis’s production at £1250. I believe that all these volumes emerged from the same private British collection. In the listing under “Muir” below, I have provided information on copy numbers and paper types not recorded in Mills’s catalogue.</p>
        <p>In July, The Antique &amp; Book Collector (Marlborough, Wiltshire) exhibited and offered for sale a group of Blake’s commercial book illustrations detached from their volumes, three 
<pb id="p29-110" n="110"/>
prints from posthumous copy o of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> (probably in partnership with N. W. Lott), some Job and Virgil prints, and a selection of prints by Calvert, Palmer, and a few twentieth-century artists influenced by the Blake followers. The handlist for the exhibition, which doubled as a sales catalogue, is remarkable for its lack of scholarship (hardly any information on states, paper, editions, etc.) and its extremely high prices for Blake’s copy engravings. All these materials are listed under the appropriate sections below.</p>
        <p>I have made one change in the format of the following sales lists. In past versions, I have included Blake’s engravings extracted from typographic books in the section headed “Separate Plates and Plates in Series.” My rationale was that the print market treats such extracts as, indeed, separate (or at least separated) plates. But as one of my most loyal readers, Jerry Bentley, has suggested, it would make more sense, from the scholar’s perspective, to group these extracts under the books from which they were removed in the section headed “Letterpress Books with Engravings by and after Blake.” This new arrangement is used here, with of course explicit indications when extracted plates rather than whole volumes were on offer.</p>
        <p>The year of all sales and catalogues in the following lists is 1995 unless indicated otherwise. The auction houses add their purchaser’s premium to the hammer price in their price lists. These net amounts are given here, following the official price lists. The value added tax levied against the buyer’s surcharge in England is not included. Late 1995 sales will be covered in the 1996 review. I am grateful for help in compiling this review to Candace J. Adelson, G. E. Bentley, Jr., Warren Cariou (who can find Blakes even in Wiltshire), Andrew Clayton-Payne of Christie’s London, D. W. Dörrbecker (once again, my Continental spy), Morris Eaves, Jenijoy La Belle, Thomas V. Lange, Nicholas Lott, Jerome J. McGann, Adam Mills, Jane Munro, Vincent Newton, Lawrence Salander, Justin Schiller, Maurice Sendak, John Trotter, Joseph Viscomi (for several helpful suggestions about Blake’s techniques and their dating), Mark Watters, David Weinglass, Henry Wemyss of Sotheby’s London, John Windle, and Andrew Wyld of Agnew’s. Once again, Patricia Neill’s editorial assistance has been invaluable. For digital imaging at the Huntington Library, I thank John Sullivan, whose learning-curve in hyperspace is steeper than mine.</p>

According to provenance records of individual plates (see Bentley 358), this hypothetical volume must have been broken up no later than 1831.<lb/><lb/>
The innermost of the four framing lines on the print reproduced here is contiguous with the margin of the central image; there is a pale blue wash between the second and third framing lines. This same style of framing, including light washes between the second and third of four framing lines, appears in <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> copy V, printed on paper with an 1818 watermark (Bentley 369) in 1821 (according to Joseph Viscomi, <hi rend="i">Blake and the Idea of the Book</hi> [Princeton: Princeton UP, 1993] 380). Thus it seems probable that the framing lines and the inscription in the same black ink were added to this <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> print c. 1818 or later. At that time, the central image may have also been touched up. For further observations on the production history of <hi rend="i">A Small Book of Designs</hi>, copy B, see the caption to illus. 3. For color illus. of this print, see A. Edward Newton, <hi rend="i">A Magnificent Farce and Other Diversions of a Book-Collector</hi> (Boston: Atlantic Monthly, P, 1921) frontispiece, and the cover of John Windle’s catalogue 26 of Dec. 1995.</figDesc>

John Windle, Dec. cat. 26, #2, from the Joseph Holland collection, with a color illus. of the Holland bookplate made from the original (price on inquiry; acquired by Justin Schiller). One of only 4 known impressions; the others are in <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> copies B (British Museum), C (Library of Congress), and D (private American collection). The examples included in these copies of the combined <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> are printed in yellow ochre or raw sienna ink, probably in the same print-run in 1794. The etching borders are not printed in copies B and C; I have not been able to inspect copy D, but it too is probably printed without borders, given Blake’s typical practice in the mid-1790s. The Holland impression is in a distinctly different ink color and the etching borders are boldly printed.</p>
            <p>Joseph Viscomi has suggested that pl. a was one of Blake’s early experiments in relief etching—see Viscomi, <hi rend="i">Blake and the Idea of the Book</hi> (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1993) 194-95. Let me add to Viscomi’s dating the speculation that the pl. may have originally been executed for <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi>, series b, but rejected. The plate size is right for that book, and the design (an adult male, assisted by winged putti, ascending heavenward) would make a fitting visualization for the second half of Blake’s concluding epigram: “God becomes as we are, that we may be as he is” (pl. b12).</p>

              <figDesc>Before Restoration; see illus. 5 for the restored print. Image 5.5 × 10.5 cm. on a sheet trimmed to 13 × 18.9 cm., with a lower portion of the sheet, 2.5 × 18.9 cm., bearing part of the outermost framing line and Blake’s caption (““O revolving serpent”/ “O the Ocean of Time &amp; Space””), retained and pasted to the verso (see illus. 4) of the backing cardboard mat (17.9 × 23.1 cm). Inscribed “16” by Blake, upper right recto. First described and reproduced in Martin Butlin, “A New Color Print from the Small Book of Designs,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 26 (1992): 19-21. Provenance: John Varley; Adam White, the gift of Mrs. John Varley, 1856; the artist Sir Joseph Noel Paton; by descent from Paton to the vendor at Sotheby’s on 13 July 1995; Essick collection.<lb/><lb/>
Blake seems to have taken advantage of the commission from Ozias Humphry for the copy of <hi rend="i">A Small Book of Designs</hi> now in the British Museum to pull one or two additional impressions of most or all of the images printed for his patron. From these impressions, plus some prints not in the copy printed for Humphry, Blake created a second copy of the book of designs from his illuminated books without the accompanying texts. Subsequent trimming of the sheets has obscured much valuable evidence, but a few reasonable suppositions can be gleaned from those not trimmed to the very edge of the image. The leaves, relative to the size of the prints, may have been quite large, as demonstrated by the 26.5 × 18.5 cm. sheet bearing <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> pl. 1. It is of course also possible that the sheets were never uniform in size. At a much later date, probably not before 1818 (see caption to illus. 2), he returned to this still-unsold second copy, drew multiple black-ink framing lines around the images, and inscribed most or all with captions in the same black ink. At some time prior to 1831, at least five of the prints were bound, as indicated by stab holes (see caption to illus. 2); five prints still bear numbers in Blake’s hand in the top right corner. The resulting album or series of numbered prints, with its original captions, might be thought of as constituting a new illuminated book, with printed designs and manuscipt texts, worthy of study as such.<lb/><lb/>
Each line of the extant one- or two-line inscriptions in Blake’s hand is placed, rather unconventionally for the time, within double quotation marks. Although Erdman believes that some of these double-quotation inscriptions are not by Blake (see E890), I think that all those within the double quotation marks are in his hand. The verso inscriptions on <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> pls. 3 and 12 lack the double quotation marks. Butlin notes that these verso inscriptions are not in Blake’s hand (#261.4, 261.10), but they may have been quoted or paraphrased from Blake’s inscriptions now trimmed off. An inquiry from Dawson Turner about the book produced for Humphry, to which Blake replied on 9 June 1818 (E771), may have prompted Blake to return to and dress up the prints he still owned. The impression from <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> pl. 20 reproduced here has been treated in cavalier fashion, but it has <hi rend="i">not</hi> been trimmed to the image (as claimed in Butlin’s essay cited above and in Sotheby’s sale catalogue). Almost certainly after the work left Blake’s hands, someone cut the sheet and pasted the two pieces to the recto and verso (illus. 4) of the backing mat, as described above. Apparently a cover mat with a window to show the image was then pasted over the backing cardboard. This cover mat was unfortunately discarded just prior to Sotheby’s auction, but its existence is indicated by the old paste used to attach it to the recto of the backing mat and now making such a mess in the illustration.<lb/><lb/>
These injuries are explainable, although certainly lamentable. It is more difficult to account for the oddest feature of the work. Blake’s sheet bears on its recto three fragments of thin, light pink paper. One fragment, upper right, obscures part of the inscribed number and outer framing line. The fragment on the left also covers a small portion of the outer framing line. The largest fragment, approx. 8 × 13 cm., surrounds Blake’s image. Its outer margin is ragged, but the window cut in it to reveal the image was carefully sized to the margins of the image. Apparently this pink paper at one time covered all or a good portion of Blake’s sheet of paper, including the framing lines and number and excluding only the image itself, and then was partly ripped off. It seems improbable that Blake would have covered up his work in this way and left disfiguring fragments behind.<lb/><lb/>
The pink-paper frame surrounding the image bears, along all four inner edges, dull grey washes. These match the color of Blake’s print along the lower margin, but do not match colors in other areas (e.g., the reddish-brown in the print upper left). These washes were added after the paper frame was glued to Blake’s print, as indicated by very slight strips of gray wash along the bottom margin, right center margin, and top left margin of Blake’s image. It thus seems probable that the pink paper was pasted over Blake’s sheet to protect it while making the margins of the image slightly more even. Yet this would hardly seem worth the trouble; the added washes are clearly visible only under magnification and do little to change the margins. This additional work on the image might have been undertaken by Paton—see the inscription tentatively attributed to him and recorded in the caption to illus. 4.<lb/><lb/>
Other than the slight touches at the edges, I can see no evidence that Blake’s work has been compromised by any other additions by another hand. The glue used to paste down the pink paper appears to be different from that used for the cover mat, and thus the application of the pink paper may have been prior to the addition of the back and front mat boards described above. By matting the print to the edge of the image, the framer had no reason to remove the remaining fragments of pink paper.</figDesc>

              <head>4 <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, pl. 20, verso of the backing mat before restoration.</head>
              <figDesc>See illus. 3 for the unrestored recto and illus. 5 for the restored recto. The strip containing Blake’s inscription and one of his framing lines, originally part of the recto of the print, has been pasted to the lower portion of the backing cardboard mat. In addition to Blake’s inscription (““O revolving serpent”. . .”), the lower portion of this sheet bears, in 3 different hands, the number “8623” (lower left, probably just a lot or inventory number written by a dealer or former owner), “Drawing of Blake’s given to A[dam] White by M<hi rend="s">rs</hi> [John] Varley March 31 1856” (left side of lower margin, probably written by White), and “evidently printed in oil [sic] &amp; touched with colour afterwards” (right side of lower margin, perhaps written by Paton, according to Sotheby’s auction catalogue—see provenance in caption to illus. 3). “Touched with colour afterwards” is probably a reference to Blake’s own procedure of adding water colors and pen and ink work to color-printed designs; but these words might refer to the very small areas of wash added to the margins of the image by another hand, possibly Paton himself, as described in the caption to illus. 3. Sadly, all these inscriptions not by Blake were lost during the heavy cleaning of the paper strip necessary for preserving it from further decay and returning its color to match the portion of the sheet bearing Blake’s print. I hope that the reproduction here will serve as a permanent record of the existence of these now-vanished inscriptions.<lb/><lb/>
The larger piece of paper on the verso, pasted above the clipping from Blake’s print, contains yet another inscription: “Original Drawing by Blake / See Rossetti’s [i.e., Gilchrist’s?] “Life and Works of Blake [lacking closing quotation mark and period].” This unattributed inscription has been preserved.</figDesc>

              <figDesc>After Restoration; see also illus. 3 and 4 (both before restoration) and the captions thereto for discussion. The detached bottom portion of the sheet has been restored and the pink paper window around the central image removed and preserved. The two other pink paper fragments (also preserved) and all glue have been removed to reveal Blake’s framing lines and number. The pink paper frame had totally obscured the second of four framing lines. As in <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> pl. 22 (illus. 2), the innermost framing line is contiguous with the margins of the image—except that, in this print, the framing line along the left margin is about 1 mm. inside the image (perhaps just a slip on Blake’s part?). I believe that the restored work now bears only Blake’s own work—except for the slight marginal washes described in the caption to illus. 4—unmasked from several stages of mistreatment by later owners, restorers, or framers.</figDesc>

            <p>Blair, <hi rend="i">The Grave.</hi> William Reese, Jan. cat. 141, #107, 1808 quarto, scattered foxing, full russia rebacked and slightly worn ($1000). Charles Parkhurst Books, April Los Angeles Book Fair, the pls. as in the 1808 folio issue and on the same laid paper, lacking the text of the poem but bound with a trimmed copy of “Of the Designs” and the prospectus for Stothard’s Canterbury Pilgrims pl., both letterpress texts from the 1808 quarto printing as indicated by the signatures (“F” on the first leaf of “Of the Designs” rather than the “K” of the folio; no signature on the first leaf of the prospectus rather than the “L” of the folio), the pls. trimmed tall and narrow (43.6 × 29.7 cm.), contemporary (or at least near-contemporary) quarter calf over marbled boards rebacked ($1600 to R. Essick). Swann, 20 April, #45, 1808 quarto, uncut in “original boards” (Hirsch, $1840); same copy, Daniel Hirsch, Oct. Santa Monica Book Fair, 1808 “folio” (actually the quarto), uncut in “original boards” (actually fairly new replacement boards), “original spine label” (the original printed label appears on the front cover, not the spine), new endpapers, internally very fine condition ($3900). When informed of these problems, Mr. Hirsch withdrew the vol. from the market and will try to return it to Swann. Pickering &amp; Chatto, May cat. 730, #15, 1813 quarto, slightly later German binding (as issued in Germany?), a copy with this dealer for about 2 years, pl. 11 illus. ($1750). Chapel Hill Rare Books, Oct. cat. 99, #141, 1808 quarto, contemporary boards rebacked with half calf, worn (“was $2,000, now $1,750”).

Kane Antiquarian Auction, Pottstown, PA, 1 Oct., #68, 1808 “folio” (but probably the quarto), some foxing, later calf in cloth case ($800). Swann, 19 Oct., #44, 1808 quarto, offsetting and foxing, half sheep rebacked and worn (not sold; estimate too high at $800-1200). SNY, 1 Nov., #40, 1808 folio, light marginal soiling and foxing, contemporary morocco, pl. 5 illus. ($3737 on an estimate of $1500-2000). BBA, 16 Nov., #161, 1808 quarto, 1 pl. missing, foxed, modern half morocco (Besley, £92). John Windle, Dec. cat. 26, #7, pls. only on sheets of the same laid paper used for the pls. in the 1808 folio, 50.8 × 34.9 cm., 2 or 3 edges showing deckle, the trimmed and bent inner edges on all sheets indicating that the pls. were once bound, the engraved title page in a previously unrecorded proof st. before imprint and “Proof Copy” inscription,
<pb id="p29-115" n="115"/><figure><head><hi rend="i">6 Little Tom the Sailor</hi>, text by William Hayley, etched in relief and white line by Blake.</head><figDesc>Printed in black ink, uncolored. Reproduced here are the tailpiece (11.2 × 16 cm.) in white-line etching and the colophon in relief etching. “Woodcut on Pewter,” as described by Blake in his Notebook (E694), would seem to be the predominant technique in both the headpiece and tailpiece. The poem and the colophon (the latter printed from its own plate, 3.5 × 12 cm.) were almost certainly etched on copper; the two design plates might have been pewter (although the “Woodcut on Pewter” process can be applied to other metals, including copper). In the impression reproduced here, the full sheet of wove paper without watermark measures 51.5 × 18.7 cm. The text of the colophon was step-etched, as revealed in this copy by the lower edge of the step that caught the surface of the inking ball and printed as a fine shadow line (perhaps just barely visible in this reproduction). Provenance: W. E. Moss (his collection stamp on the cloth portfolio still with this copy); Moss sale, Sotheby’s London, 2 March 1937, #191 (“Withdrawn” according to the printed price list, but “mislaid” and thus not sold according to Geoffrey Keynes, <hi rend="i">Blake Studies</hi>, 2nd ed. [Oxford: Clarendon P, 1971] 108); offered again at Sotheby’s London, 20 Dec. 1938, #458 (Robinson, £48), and then by the London dealer Robinson in Dec. 1939 (£84), according to Keynes as cited above; apparently acquired by the Scribner Book Store of New York, as indicated by an undated and unpriced typescript advertisement retained with this copy; Parke-Bernet Gallery auction, New York, 9 Dec. 1952, #87 (Joseph Holland, $130, according to the Parke-Bernet invoice retained with this copy); inherited from Holland by Vincent Newton, Jan. 1995; the San Francisco dealer John Windle, offered in his “Blake” cat. of Nov. 1995, # 3; R. Essick.</figDesc></figure>
all other pls. in the 1st published sts. found in the 1808 folio issue, modern cloth portfolio, from the Joseph Holland collection, pl. 12 illus. (price on inquiry; acquired by R. Essick); #17, 1808 quarto, cut down, later half calf worn, from the Joseph Holland collection ($375).</p>
            <p>A note on 1808 issues of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>: The sets listed above of the pls. in the 1808 folio “Proof” sts. now in my collection, both lacking the text of the poem, suggest that Blake’s designs may have been issued by Cromek in 1808 as a suite of pls. A purchaser of such a set of pls. may have also been given the opportunity to acquire a pamphlet-like copy of “Of the Designs” to accompany the prints. The fact that the description of the designs in the copy I acquired from Parkhurst, along with the Chaucer prospectus printed as part of the same gathering, are from the 1808 quarto printing makes this scenario possible. If the copy of the pls. without the poem was extracted, at a later
<pb id="p29-116" n="116"/><figure><head><hi rend="i">The Illustrated Book of Songs for Children</hi>, London, Edinburgh, and New York, T. Nelson and Sons, preface dated August 1863.</head><figDesc>Opening showing pp. 128-29, containing Blake’s “The Chimney Sweeper” from <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> with a musical score beneath which the first verse is printed. With the poem’s title changed to “Chimney Sweeper’s Song,” the word “left” added after “I was” in the first line, other startling alterations in wording in the first and third verses, and “Tom Dacre” changed to “Tom Teddy” in the second verse. As far as I can determine, this is the first published musical setting for the poem, perhaps even the first for any work by Blake (nothing earlier listed in Donald Fitch, <hi rend="i">Blake Set to Music: A Bibliography of Musical Settings of the Poems and Prose of William Blake</hi> [Berkeley: U of California P, 1990]). Essick collection.</figDesc></figure>
date, from the 1808 folio issue of the poem, then yet a second copy of the book, an 1808 quarto, must have been cannibalized to make up the copy recorded here. Finding two damaged or incomplete copies from which to retrieve the requisite parts, or destroying two complete copies of the 1808 ed., seems either extremely serendipitous or financially stupid. The final verso of the quarto pamphlet is worn and a bit dirty, as though it had once been unbound and rubbed against a surface other than the leaf (the back of the frontispiece portrait of Blake) it faces in the present binding. However, heavy indentations from the pamphlet into contiguous leaves indicate that it has been bound in its present position for many decades. At least the unique proof st. of the engraved title page in the disbound set of pls. acquired from Windle is very unlikely to have been extracted from an uncut copy of the 1808 folio. We know that the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> pls. were issued in portfolio without a text of the poem on at least two other occasions (1870, 1926); the pls., printed on laid India paper, may have also been issued separately in 1813.</p>
            <p>Bryant, <hi rend="i">New System . . . of Ancient Mythology</hi>, 2nd ed., 1775-77. P &amp; P Books, Jan. cat. L10, #23, 3 vols., full calf ornately gilt, some splitting of joints (£425).</p>

Santa Monica Book Fair. John Windle, Dec. cat. 26, #204, frontispiece only (Perry after Blake), from the Keynes collection ($1250).</p>
            <p>Cumberland, <hi rend="i">Thoughts on Outline</hi>, 1796. Ken Spelman, May cat. 30, #22, some light foxing, uncut in original limp boards, pl. 2 illus. (£850). Phillip Pirages, July cat. 34, #199, some foxing, “from the author” inscribed on leaf before title page, uncut and unopened in original boards rebacked ($2250).</p>

John Windle, Dec. cat. 26, #28, 2nd ed. of Part 1, 3rd of Part 2, the only large-paper copy of these eds. I have ever seen, early quarter calf over marbled boards, amateurishly rebacked with the original spine laid down, from the Joseph Holland collection ($650).</p>
            <p>A note on large-paper copies of <hi rend="i">The Botanic Garden</hi>: Large-paper copies of both the 1st and 2nd eds. of Part 1 can be distinguished on the basis of paper type as well as size. Small-paper copies are printed on an unwatermarked wove paper with a distinctive checkered pattern (when viewed in a backing light) created by a bold wire mesh used in the paper mold(s). Large-paper copies are printed on a heavier wove paper lacking the checkered pattern and showing, in at least a few gatherings, an “E &amp; P” (Edmeads and Pine) watermark.</p>

              <figDesc>Pen and ink, brown and gray washes, 62.5 × 96 cm. (Fuseli’s largest known drawing), dated to c. 1772. The design illustrates Act 3, scene 4, of Shakespeare’s <hi rend="i">King Lear.</hi> Edgar’s gigantic proportions, perspectivally out of scale with the distance (indicated by the landscape) between him and the group of three on the right, approaches Blake’s technique of representing figures of vastly different sizes apparently at the same distance from the viewer.

              <figDesc>Oil on canvas, 60.3 × 75.5 cm. Inscribed in Greek on the lining canvas and frame, probably repeating a now-covered inscription on the original canvas, “Women? Nay, never women! Gorgons more” (from Aeschylus, <hi rend="i">Eumenides</hi>). The auction catalogue entry claims that these witches are men, whereas in all other versions by Fuseli (including the 1785 mezzotint by J. R. Smith), they are women. I fail to see how these figures are more masculine than other versions, particularly since Fuseli’s point would seem to be the transgression of gender boundaries in accord with Shakespeare’s text: “You should be women,/ And yet your beards forbid me to interpret/ That you are so” (<hi rend="i">Macbeth</hi>, Act I, scene 3).

Essick). Locker has written in pencil, just left of the entry for the Linnell set of the Job water colors in W. M. Rossetti’s catalogue printed in Gilchrist’s vol. 2, “? This is mine FL” (2:214). Two vertical pencil lines suggest that Locker is referring only to <hi rend="i">Satan Pouring Disease on Job</hi> (Butlin #551.6, entitled <hi rend="i">Satan Smiting Job with Boils</hi>). A pencil inscription on the verso of the front free flyleaf of vol. 2, also in Locker’s hand, reads as follows: “See P. 214 I exchanged it for 3 Books with Sir C[harles Wentworth] Dilke.” This could not be correct since the Linnell set was not sold by the Linnell family until 1918. Locker must be referring to the tempera of this subject, recorded by Butlin #807 as having been in both the Locker and Dilke collections.</p>

<q>
. . .Your reasons for the upright position of the Bible [in a preliminary drawing for Blake’s pl. of “A Sketch of the Monument . . . In Memory of William Cowper” in Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Life of Cowper</hi>], the task [i.e., a copy of Cowper’s <hi rend="i">The Task</hi>] leaning against it and supported by it, and for the introduction of a Palm branch of Victory, are abundantly convincing and satisfactory. I am well pleased with the whole group of Hieroglyphics &amp; I shall endeavour to execute your drawing punctually &amp; exactly in such a manner, that the execution may reflect no disgrace upon the Idea;<lb/>
When I raised an objection in a former letter it was not to the symbols or their Composition but as a workman I saw that a drawing which looked light &amp; beautiful on paper when translated into marble under the restrictions of basreliefs in a situation which requires the round objects must produce a flat &amp; meagre effect: I shall be much obliged to Mr. Blake, Yourself or any friend, who will take the trouble to suggest a good Idea or correct a faulty one of mine, to Mr. Blake I have been indebted for hints &amp; criticisms which I found it my interest to adopt. I would at any times rather work upon a fine design by another, than one inferior of my own, &amp; I only take the liberty of submitting doubts when the reputation of My Friend &amp; myself are at stake by an oversight:<lb/>
Concerning the price of the Monument it will be 45 Guineas, for the Palm branch near 4 feet long will require considerable labour to be intirely [sic] relieved; the expence of packing, Carriage, &amp; Travelling charges of the Mason who goes to set it up, will be seperate [sic], these may be about 15£ more, besides which if any fee is required for the place in Dereham Church that must be paid by Lady Hesketh;<lb/>
The last Epitaph written for our departed friend is certainly more Sublime in thought &amp; pathetic in expression than the former &amp; is therefore to be preferred[.] Nancy unites unites [sic] in love to Yourself &amp; Mr. &amp; Mrs.: Blake with,<lb/>
Dear Friend<lb/>
Your affectionate &amp; obliged<lb/>

                <figDesc>Pencil and gray wash, 10.9 × 6.4 cm., datable to c. 1828 when Sherman was working with Samuel Palmer and George Richmond. Signed in cartouche, bottom center, “W S F” (Welby Sherman <hi rend="i">fecit</hi>) or perhaps “W S P” (Welby Sherman <hi rend="i">pinxit</hi>). Essick collection. Formerly pasted into a notebook in which “W Sherman” was inscribed (by Richmond?) on the backing leaf just beneath the drawing. The notebook passed by inheritance from Richmond to his great granddaughter, Miriam Hartley, who removed the drawing in the 1970s and sold it to a private British collector. Another drawing attributed to Sherman was sold in London by Sotheby’s in 1967, but I have not been able to trace its present ownership or find any further drawings or paintings by Sherman. Although in many academic respects awkward, the design and its miniaturistic detail captures much of the spirit of the youthful “Ancients” when most under the spell of Blake and their own “visionary” imaginations. The cartouche and signature (particularly if the last letter is “F”) suggest that the drawing was executed as a preliminary for an engraving. For a color illus. and insightful comments, see Raymond Lister, <hi rend="i">British Romantic Painting</hi> (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1989) no. 59.</figDesc>

            <p>“Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims,” 4th st., pp. 68-70. Another impression of the rare 4th st., with the scratched inscriptions left and right of the title, is in the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester, Rochester, New York. According to Candace J. Adelson, Curator of European Art, the sheet of laid paper measures 35.6 × 95.9 cm. Formerly folded in half, the print also has several repaired tears. The scratched inscriptions are very light (hardly visible in a photograph). Given to the Gallery in 1983 by a local collector.</p>
            <p>“Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims,” pp. 70-71, impression 5GG. For the sale of this impression by John Windle to a private Chicago collector, see “Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims” under Separate Plates, above.</p>
            <p>“Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims,” pp. 85-86. The astute print dealer N. W. Lott has found some internal evidence for determining the printing history of the 5th (final) st. In an impression presently (Feb. 1995) in his possession, there are several scratches and other defects that do not appear in impressions of earlier sts. and appear only as slight shadows, if at all, in what are almost certainly Colnaghi (beginning c. 1881) and Sessler (1941) impressions. The most evident of these flaws are a horizontal scratch through the head, eye and nose of the Cook; scratches or corrosion in a horizontal band on the right shoulder and just above the right breast of the Lady Abbess; a similar blemish on the rump of the Knight’s horse just left of his saddle; and a vertical scar on the head of the Knight’s horse extending from the top of his bridle to his mane. Lott’s impression is on heavy wove paper and is very probably earlier than impressions that show only minimal evidence of these defects. Perhaps Colnaghi repaired these accidental defects that occurred between the 4th st. impressions (probably lifetime) and 1881. Since only very slight indications of some of these flaws appear on impressions on thin laid paper with prominent chain lines, I can no longer claim that they may be among the earliest 5th st. impressions.</p>
            <p>“George Cumberland’s Card,” p. 113, impression 1M. For the recent history of this impression, see under “Separate Plates,” above.</p>
            <p>“Calisto,” pp. 142-43. For a newly-recorded impression, see under “Separate Plates,” above. The fact that the new impression in brown ink on laid paper is in the 2nd st. makes it probable that impression F (Keynes Collection, Fitzwilliam Museum), lacking the title and imprint but in a similar ink on laid paper, is also in the 2nd st.</p>
            <p>“Fall of Rosamond,” p. 134, impression 1B. Acquired by the Connecticut print dealer N. W. Lott in Aug. 1995 and sold in the same month to R. Essick.</p>
            <p>“The Right Honourable Earl Spencer,” pp. 181-82. According to Peter Ackroyd, <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> (London: Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995) 307, “The publisher [Robert] Bowyer . . . helped to arrange his [Blake’s] work on an engraving from Thomas Phillips’s portrait of Earl Spencer.” Ackroyd offers no source for this information or any further explanation. His comments may be based on nothing more than Bowyer’s letter of 20 June 1810 to Earl Spencer about Blake’s Chaucer engraving—see G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Records Supplement</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1988) 132-33.</p>
            <p>“Wilson Lowry,” pp. 201-03. 3rd st. on laid India, with an impression between the 3rd and 4th st. also on laid India, acquired by N. W. Lott in Aug. 1995 and sold in the same month to R. Essick. For a description of the these impressions and the intermediate st., not listed in <hi rend="i">Separate Plates</hi>, see Essick, “A Supplement to <hi rend="i">The Separate Plates of William Blake: A Catalogue</hi>,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 17 (1984): 143.</p>

            <p>P. 23. For yet another issue of <hi rend="i">The Whole Genuine and Complete Works of Flavius Josephus</hi>, published by J. Cooke, see Josephus under “Letterpress Books with Engravings by and After Blake,” above. D. W. Dörrbecker suggests to me that the designer of pls. 1 and 3, signed by “C. M. Metz” as at least the delineator (“delin.”), may be Caroline M. Metz, not Conrad Martin Metz. The former was a painter, the latter principally an engraver.</p>
            <p>P. 24, 2nd st. of Kimpton and Josephus, pl. 1. D. W. Dörrbecker has pointed out to me that the pl. is signed “<hi rend="i">Metz delin.</hi>,” not “<hi rend="i">Metz Delin.</hi>”</p>
            <p>P. 48, Darwin, <hi rend="i">Botanic Garden</hi>, pl. 6 (“Tornado”). The proof listed in Raymond Lister’s collection, lacking finishing work in the image but with all letters, was acquired in Aug. by N. W. Lott.</p>
            <p>P. 90, Hayley, <hi rend="i">Life of Cowper</hi>, pl. 6. Early in March 1802, Hayley sent John Flaxman a revised drawing for this plate. In his newly-recorded reply of 19 March 1802, Flaxman thanks Hayley and Blake for their suggestions and names a price of 45 guineas for the execution of the monument in marble. For a partial transcription of this letter, apparently including all references to Blake, see under Flaxman, above.</p>

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>This division is organized by individual (say, William Hayley or John Flaxman), listing works by and about Blake’s friends and patrons, living individuals with whom he had significant direct and demonstrable contact. It will include Thomas Butts, Thomas Hartley Cromek, George Cum-berland, John Flaxman and his family, Henry Fuseli, Thomas and William Hayley, John Linnell and his family, Samuel Palmer, James Parker, George Richmond, Thomas Stothard, and John Varley. It does <hi rend="i">not</hi> include important contemporaries with whom Blake’s contact was negligible or non-existent such as John Constable and William Wordsworth and Edmund Burke; such major figures are dealt with more comprehensively elsewhere, and the light they throw upon Blake is very dim.</p>
          <p>Reviews listed here are only for books which are substantially about Blake, not for those with only, say, a chapter on Blake. These reviews are listed under the book reviewed; the authors of the reviews may be recovered from the index.</p>
          <p>“Blake and His Circle” serves in part as an addendum to <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (1977) and to <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> (1995). I take <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> and its <hi rend="i">Supplement, faute de mieux</hi>, to be the standard bibliographical authorities on Blake<ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> and have noted significant differences from them. <note id="n2"><hi rend="s">2</hi> Except for the states of the plates for Blake’s commercial book engravings, where the standard authority is R. N. Essick, <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations</hi> (1991).</note></p>
          <p>In general, Keiko Aoyama is responsible for works in Japanese, and I am greatly indebted to her for her meticulous accuracy and her patience in translating the words and conventions of Japan into our very different context.</p>
          <p>I am grateful to many kind assistants, especially to Freda Ablett, Keiko Aoyama, Julia Bentley, Martin Butlin, Cambridge University Press, R. F. J. Dewhurst, D. W.

Poole (of the Fitzwilliam Museum), Princeton University Press, Dennis Read, Michael Tolley, Joseph Viscomi, Stephen Wagner (of the Pforzheimer Collection), and particularly to Dr. E. B. Bentley.</p>

          <p>The records here of Blake discovery and scholarship are somewhat slighter than for previous years. Most notable among the books are the magisterial editions of <hi rend="i">The Continental Prophecies</hi> edited by D. W. Dörrbecker and of <hi rend="i">The Urizen Books</hi> edited by David Worrall, the biography by Peter Ackroyd, and the collection of essays on Blake’s art by Christopher Heppner. Each is a very notable publication which is likely to be widely and deservedly consulted.</p>
          <p>The languages in which Blake studies are published continues to be dauntingly diverse; those recorded for this year alone include Danish, English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Polish, and Swedish, and doubtless some have been overlooked, particularly in Italian, Spanish, and Russian.</p>

Essick (see illus. 1-3), the Receipt of 5 July 1805 to John Windle, and <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> pl. a to Justin Schiller.</p>
              <p>Perhaps more surprising is the identification of the obscure nineteenth-century landscape artist James Ferguson as a major Blake collector with a Blake collection rivaling in size all but those of the richest of his contemporaries.</p>
              <p>And most tantalizing of all is the previously unknown extensive manuscript containing translations with learned notes of plays by Sophocles and the repeated signature of William Blake. Nothing remotely like this Sophocles Manuscript is known in the Blake canon—but then, nothing remotely like the poem and drawing by Blake on the drinking glass known as The Felpham Rummer was known before its discovery in 1982, and the Felpham Rummer is now accepted as genuine. The Sophocles Manuscript will be a major new resource for Blake studies if its connection with Blake can be firmly established.</p>

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>A surprising number of comparatively trifling editions of Blake’s poetry were published in 1995, including <hi rend="i">Blake’s Selected Poems</hi>, ed. David &amp; Virginia Erdman, <hi rend="i">Holes in the Texture of Time, Jerusalem</hi> [i.e., the lyric from <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>], with wood engravings by Linda Anne Landers, <hi rend="i">Poems of William Blake</hi>, ed. Peter Ackroyd, <hi rend="i">Selected Poems</hi> (N.Y.: Gramercy Books, 1995), <hi rend="i">Selected Poems</hi> (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics) (1994; 1995), <hi rend="i">Selected Works</hi>, ed. David Stevens, and <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> (Penguin). None of these pretends to advance knowledge, but the Stevens edition may be useful for “students in schools and colleges,” with its suggestions for “Activities and approaches,” and the Jerusalem lyric from <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> is a pretty little shaped “book.”</p>
          <pb id="p29-133" n="133"/>
          <p>Of enormously greater importance and beauty are the last of the volumes in the new Blake Trust series of reproductions called Blake’s Illuminated Books: <hi rend="i">The Continental Prophecies</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Urizen Books.</hi> The whole of the new series (1991-95) is a triumph, serving quite a difference audience from the original Blake Trust series of facsimiles (1951-87), at far more modest prices, using more advanced and often better technology, and mustering a far more impressive and sophisticated range of scholarship in support of the reproductions than was attempted in the first series of Blake Trust facsimiles. Now, at the cost of the cheapest trans-Atlantic plane flight or a washing machine or half a computer, one may obtain not only first-class reproductions in color of one copy of each of Blake’s works in Illuminated Printing but also the best scholarship and the most sophisticated criticism of them.</p>
          <p>One of the virtues of the series is that the copies reproduced have sometimes not been reproduced at all or adequately before. <hi rend="i">America</hi> (H) has not previously been reproduced, <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (B) was reproduced in 1978 only in black-and-white and in 1990 in reduced size, and <hi rend="i">Song of Los</hi> (A) was only somewhat approximately reproduced in 1890 and in black-and-white in 1978. <hi rend="i">The Continental Prophecies</hi> thus exhibits forms of Blake’s works scarcely accessible otherwise save in the originals. Similarly, for <hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen</hi> (D), <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi> (A), and <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> (A) in <hi rend="i">The Urizen Books, Urizen</hi> (D) was previously reproduced in 1876 only in black-and-white, <hi rend="i">Ahania</hi> (A) in 1892, 1973, 1974 (in black-and-white), and 1978 (in black-and-white), and <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> (A) in 1974 (in black-and-white), 1976, and 1978 (in black-and-white). (<hi rend="i">Ahania</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> survive in only one copy each.) <hi rend="i">The Urizen Books</hi> reproduced here are all color-printed, a medium notoriously difficult to reproduce, and these new reproductions are notably satisfactory in this respect.</p>
          <p>Equally impressive is the quality of scholarship which accompanies the reproductions. D. W. Dörrbecker and David Worrall have assembled a formidable mass of information and presented it deftly and effectively. Indeed, so substantial is the apparatus which they provide that what was originally intended to be presented within the covers of one volume had to be separated into two substantial quarto volumes totaling almost 600 pages. This editorial apparatus is extremely valuable and should be made accessible as widely as possible. It would be desirable to reprint the whole series in two different formats, one with only the color facsimiles and the other with typeset text and this extraordinary apparatus to accompany it.</p>
          <p>An indication of the value justly attached to the Blake Trust facsimiles is the fact that they have repeatedly been reproduced, often silently and somewhat approximately, in reproductions of facsimiles. An example is the edition of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> published in Vienna and Lana with some plates in color and most in black-and-white. This is the sincerest kind of flattery, particularly when, as here, the relationship is honestly acknowledged.</p>

            <p>The most notable publication reproducing Blake’s art is the selective reprinting of illustrations from the great Keynes and Binyon edition of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> designs published by the Pierpont Morgan Library in 1935. Now that the Keynes and Binyon edition is (more or less) out of copyright, about half of the designs published there have been reproduced by Dover, though without the accompanying text. If one has no access to the Morgan edition of that or the Blake Trust in 1987, this Dover publication may be useful as providing reproductions of reproductions.</p>

              </title>
            </head>
            <p>Several of the catalogues of Blake published in 1995 were surprisingly ambitious, and two of the minor ones are quite useful. Doubtless the most frivolous exhibition catalogue associated with Blake in 1995 or perhaps in any other year is the one called <hi rend="i">The Genitals Are Beauty</hi> (London: House of William Blake), printed on a small brown paper bag. All the rest at least have serious intellectual pretensions. Robin Hamlyn’s small Tate exhibition called <hi rend="i">William Blake and Patronage</hi> has useful information particularly on Blake’s early patron John Hawkins and on the neighborhood of Thomas Butts, and D. W. Dörrbecker, <hi rend="i">“In Cambridge &amp; in Oxford, places of Thought”:</hi> Blake in British Theses 1950-1994, records a surprising number of Blake theses which had not previously appeared in Blake bibliographies. One of the most impressive Blake sale catalogues for many years, perhaps in this century, was that of John Windle in <hi rend="i">The Blake Collection of Joseph Holland &amp; Vincent Newton</hi>, with admirable descriptions and reproductions—and prices sometimes too searing to be committed to print. The most ambitious Blake bibliography was G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi>, which covers the years from the completion of <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (1975) until 1993, using the same standards and conventions.</p>

          <p>Two new journals concerning Blake have begun publication. The first is <hi rend="i">Urthona</hi>, for which “Blake is, as it were, the guiding spirit,” with even stronger Buddhist overtones. Thus far, Blake has been only occasionally the explicit subject of <hi rend="i">Urthona.</hi> For the <hi rend="i">Journal of the Blake Society at St James</hi>, on the other hand, Blake is the only subject, though in a somewhat eclectic fasion, with stories for children and poems and reflections on Blake by an industrialist. It sometimes takes its readers somewhat surprisingly into the world of sex and commerce. For instance, the assertion by a former director of British Rail that Blake “has proved to be, for me, the revelation of revelations” prompted an irreverent contributor to the <hi rend="i">Times Literary Supplement</hi> to comment: “So, in the late 1970s and early 80s, British Rail was effectively run by William Blake? This surely explains a lot.”<ref target="n17" type="note">17</ref><note id="n17"><hi rend="s">17</hi> D. S., “NB,” <hi rend="i">TLS</hi>, 23 June 1995, p. 16.</note></p>

          <p>As has been the case for half a century and more, there is a great deal of writing about Blake by Japanese scholars and in Japanese. I ignore here most works in Japanese because I cannot confidently read this major language of Blake criticism, though more is published on Blake in Japanese than in all other non-English languages combined. Among the most energetic and promising of these are the essays of Keiko Aoyama, Toru Endo, and Rikyu Kono. Note also the collection of Blake essays in English in <hi rend="i">Centre and Circumference:</hi> Essays in English Romanticism [by members of the] Association of English Romanticism in Japan, edited by Kenkichi Kamijima, particularly those by Eiko Endo and Shigeru Taniguchi.</p>

              <hi rend="b">Blake Biography</hi>
            </title>
          </head>
          <p>The most important and influential book about Blake published in 1995 was Peter Ackroyd’s ambitious and comprehensive biography called <hi rend="i">Blake.</hi> It is admirably up-to-date, with biographical details from the latest articles, but it rarely attempts to take the reader much beyond the best information previously available. And when it does attempt such novelty, it is not always very reliable.<ref target="n18" type="note">18</ref> Chapters with biographical details are interspersed with sections on what Blake was writing at the time (usually fairly conventionally described) and on what he was drawing (much more rewarding). In particular, there is a consistent attempt to depict Blake in his London setting and to characterize him as a Cockney, which apparently here means one who loves London rather than someone born within the sound of Bow Bells who drops his “h”s. Ackroyd’s account of Blake is careful and loving and is probably the best biography of the poet published since those by Alexander Gilchrist (1863) and Mona Wilson (1927). <note id="n18"><hi rend="s">18</hi> See, for instance, the claims that Blake engraved for <hi rend="i">The Conjuror’s Magazine</hi> (see below under Engravings) and that the Gordon Rioters of 1780 surged past Blake’s house in Broad Street; the Broad Street infested by the Gordon Rioters was in the City, near St. Paul’s, not in Westminster where Blake lived.</note></p>
          <p>Two other scholars have made significant contributions to our understanding of Blake’s life and biographical context. Joseph Viscomi discovered that Blake’s patron Thomas Butts was married twice and consequently that there is some uncertainty as to the identity of the intended recipient (which “Mrs Butts”?) of Blake’s poem called “The Phoenix.”<ref target="n19" type="note">19</ref> This extraordinary discovery has wide-ranging implications for the ownership of many of Blake’s most important works in the nineteenth century. And Aileen Ward has assembled strong evidence to show that Blake’s favorite brother Robert was born, not in August 1767, as <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> had suggested, but in June 1762, as Gilchrist and all other earlier biographers had asserted.<ref target="n20" type="note">20</ref><note id="n19"><hi rend="s">19</hi> Joseph Viscomi, “William Blake’s ‘The Phoenix / to Mrs Butts’ Redux,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, XXIX, 12-15. See also his essay on “Blake in the Marketplace 1852: Thomas Butts, Jr. and Other Unknown Nineteenth-Century Blake Collectors,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, XXIX, 40-68.</note><note id="n20"><hi rend="s">20</hi> Aileen Ward, “Who Was Robert Blake?” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, XXVIII, 84-89.</note></p>
          <p>Michael Phillips has revised a number of his bibliographical essays on <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> and <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> which have been translated into French as <hi rend="i">William Blake:</hi> Recherches pour une Biographie: Six Etudes.</p>
          <p>And Marsha Keith Schuchard has presented yet more evidence of the strange magical, Masonic and Swedenborgian worlds which Blake may—or may not—have participated in.<ref target="n21" type="note">21</ref><note id="n21"><hi rend="s">21</hi> Marsha Keith Schuchard, “William Blake and the Promiscuous Baboons: A Cagliostroan Séance Gone Awry,” <hi rend="i">British Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies</hi>, XVIII (1995), 185-200.</note></p>

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>Christopher Heppner’s <hi rend="i">Reading Blake’s Designs</hi> is the most important book about Blake’s art published for some years. It incorporates six of his previously-published essays concentrating particularly upon Blake’s work as a History Painter, the aspect of his work which Blake would have thought to be most valuable. Probably the most rewarding section is the one on that perennial enigma, The Arlington Court Picture, which Heppner has analyzed more persuasively than any of his predecessors—though uncertainties yet remain.</p>
          <p>Similar close reading is displayed with remarkable learning by Irene Chayes, in examining the image in Blake, Edward Young, and his predecessors of a bust or statue of Mercury used as a finger-post at the roadside.<ref target="n22" type="note">22</ref><note id="n22"><hi rend="s">22</hi> Irene Chayes, “<hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> 273 and ‘Mercury at the Cross-roads’: Constructing Blake’s Quarrels with Young,” <hi rend="i">Colby Quarterly</hi>, XXXI (1995), 123-41.

          <p>A number of books on Blake have been published dealing
<pb id="p29-135" n="135"/>
with both recondite and fashionable subjects in a workman-like way. Danièle Chauvin’s <hi rend="i">L’oeuvre de William Blake:</hi> Apocalypse et transfiguration is a “mythocritique” study of images and structures, and Jules van Lieshout’s <hi rend="i">Within and Without Eternity:</hi> The Dynamics of Interaction in William Blake’s Myth and Poetry is a revised dissertation concentrating on a “state of criticality” (187) in the <hi rend="i">Marriage, Urizen, Vala, Milton</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> Eugenie R. Freed, <hi rend="i">“A Portion of His Life”:</hi> William Blake’s Miltonic Vision of Woman concludes rather unconventionally that Blake creates “a concept of gender that was remarkable for its time in its sensitivity to female sexuality, and its breaking down of sexual stereotypes” (122, 126, 125). Peter J. Sorensen, <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Recreation of Gnostic Myth:</hi> Resolving the Apparent Incongruities approaches another subject of perennial fascination and difficulty. Sheila Spector has returned to the Kabbala in the context of Blake and Milton,<ref target="n23" type="note">23</ref> and Tilottoma Rajan has written challengingly about “the reading-function within the text [<hi rend="i">which</hi>] results in a discursive function that is characteristically romantic.<ref target="n24" type="note">24</ref><note id="n23"><hi rend="s">23</hi> Sheila A.

          <p>As usual, the solidest scholarly work relating to Blake’s writings and art is provided by Robert N. Essick; in 1995 this consists of his magisterial “Blake in the Marketplace, 1994” in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, XXVIII.

            <p>Relatively little has been published on Blake’s confined circle (except for Thomas Butts mentioned above).

(6) Acquired before 1980 (when the new ownership is recorded in <hi rend="i">The Letters of William Blake</hi>, ed. Geoffrey Keynes [1980], 198) by <hi rend="i">Charles Ryskamp.</hi><note id="n33"><hi rend="s">33</hi> In her Preface to Alexander Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi> (1880), Anne Gilchrist thanks “Mr. Kirby” for his “courtesy” in allowing her to print several unidentified letters sold in 1878. Presumably Kirby bought all the letters acquired at the 1878 sale by Waller (listed above), all of which were later sold by Joseph Mayer at Sotheby’s, 19 July 1887. All the other letters from the 1878 sale printed in the 1880 Gilchrist come from the collections in the British Museum Library (1), Frederick Locker-Lampson (5), and Macmillan (9).

The letters of 12 March, 2, 27 April, 28 September 1804 were printed in Gilchrist (1880), but that of 31 March 1804 acquired by Waller and presumably by Kirby is not given by Gilchrist, perhaps because it is concerned merely with business.</p><p>J.

                <p>?1829 Catherine Blake to James Ferguson in Tynemouth History: (1) About 1829<ref target="n34" type="note">34</ref> Catherine Blake sent to the artist James Ferguson<ref target="n35" type="note">35</ref> of Tynemouth “a List of Works by Blake, offered for sale by his widow”;<ref target="n36" type="note">36</ref> (2) Untraced. <note id="n34"><hi rend="s">34</hi> The date may be about 11 April 1829 when Tatham wrote to an anonymous patron “In behalf of the widow of the late William Blake” with a list of “works for sale” (the works are not detailed in the only known MS of the letter) (<hi rend="i">Blake Records Supplement</hi> [1988], 90). It is possible that the letter to Ferguson was written on behalf of Catherine Blake (like this one by Tatham) rather than by her.</note><note id="n35"><hi rend="s">35</hi> Ferguson “took three or four of the Engraved Books” (according to Alexander Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake, “Pictor Ignotus”</hi> [1863] I, 366), perhaps including “<hi rend="i">A work called Outhoon. 12 Plates, 6 inches more or less</hi>” which was offered to him (II, 262). <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> guesses this to be <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> (N) but does not notice that Ferguson also owned two or three other unnamed books.
                                        <p>Apparently W.M. Rossetti asked Tatham to reconstruct the list of seven color-prints offered to Ferguson, and Tatham replied a little uncertainly on 9 Nov 1862:
<q><hi rend="i">Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was one [<hi rend="i">Butlin #302 or 304</hi>]; <hi rend="i">Pity like a New-born Babe</hi> [<hi rend="i">#311 or 312</hi>], <hi rend="i">Newton</hi> [<hi rend="i">#307</hi>]; <hi rend="i">The Saviour</hi> [“<hi rend="i">Christ Appearing to the Apostles after the Resurrection #326 or 327</hi>] another, <hi rend="i">Eve with the Serpent</hi> [“<hi rend="i">Satan Exulting Over Eve #292</hi>] another, <hi rend="i">Elijah in the Chariot</hi> [“<hi rend="i">God Judging Adam #295 or 296</hi>] another; and the seventh I do not remember .... [<hi rend="i">Rossetti Papers 1862-1876</hi>, ed. W. M. Rossetti (1903), 16-17]

                <p>Binding: (1) The design from the bottom of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> pl. 20 was color-printed about 1796 onto a leaf at least 18.9 × 15.5 cm;<ref target="n37" type="note">37</ref> (2) Perhaps about 1818,<ref target="n38" type="note">38</ref> Blake took up the print again, drew four black framing lines round the design, wrote “16” in the top right corner, and inscribed it in the same black ink:
<q>
“O revolving serpent”<lb/>
“O the Ocean of Time &amp; Space”
</q><note id="n37"><hi rend="s">37</hi> The size is a combination of the present dimensions of the separated print-leaf (18.9 × 13 cm) with those of the fragment with the inscription once pasted to its verso (18.9 × 2.5 cm).</note><note id="n38"><hi rend="s">38</hi> In his letter of 9 June 1818 to Dawson Turner, Blake mentioned the copy of the Small Book of Designs (A) which he had made in 1796 for Ozias Humphry and which Turner had apparently seen in the collection of Humphry’s son William Upcott who was, like Turner, a keen autograph collector. Perhaps in 1818 Blake took up again the prints for Small Book (B).</note></p>
                <p>(3) A ragged-edged pink masking-leaf c. 16.5 × 12.2 cm with a window exactly the size of the print was pasted to the print-leaf, and the print was touched up with washes of the same colors as the print, some of the color lapping over and disfiguring the ragged-edged pink masking-leaf;<ref target="n39" type="note">39</ref> (4) A card-board backing was pasted to the verso of the print; (5) A strip 2.5 × 18.9 cm bearing the inscription and the outer two framinglines was cut off the bottom of the print-leaf and pasted to the bottom of the verso of the carboard backing; (6) Apparently a leaf with a window exactly the size of the print was pasted to the recto of the print-leaf, presumably to obscure the coloring which laps outside the print-area onto the ragged-edged pink masking-leaf and which would have obscured the inscription had it not been trimmed off and pasted to the verso; (7) The (hypothetical) outer window was removed from the ragged-edged pink masking-leaf (leaving behind a good deal of disfiguring paste) and discarded; (8) In 1995, the paper strip was heavily cleaned<ref target="n40" type="note">40</ref> in order to return its color to match the portion of the sheet bearing Blake’s print, the strip was re-attached to the print, the ragged-edged pink masking-leaf and the two other fragments of pink paper were removed (and preserved)<ref target="n41" type="note">41</ref>—see Essick, illus. 3 (recto before restoration), 4 (verso before restoration), and 5 (design only, after restoration). <note id="n39"><hi rend="s">39</hi> This ragged-edged pink masking-leaf seems to be an expendable device to keep the margins of the print neat; presumably it was to be discarded, as were similar windows (if they were used) in all other cases. Its preservation here must be an accident.</note><note id="n40"><hi rend="s">40</hi> In the process of cleaning, the inscriptions in three non-Blakean hands—“8623,” “Drawing of Blake’s given to A[dam] White by M<hi rend="s">rs</hi> Varley March 31 1856,” and “evidently printed in oil &amp; touched with colour afterwards” were lost, though they are visible in Plate 4 above.</note><note id="n41"><hi rend="s">41</hi> For almost all the information and deductions here, I am indebted to correspondence with Robert Essick and to drafts of “Blake in the Marketplace, 1995” for <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> (1996). The 1818 date and even parts of the sequence here are particularly hypothetical.</note></p>

                <p>Spectacles, Blake’s</p>
                <p>Description: A pair of iron-framed round spectacles (11.5 cm wide to the hinges, 10.6 cm for the ear-pieces), right lens −3.25 Diopter Spheres, left −3.50 DS, indicates that the wearer could see nearby objects well but that for objects beyond arm’s length he would need spectacles (see illus. 1).<ref target="n48" type="note">48</ref><note id="n48"><hi rend="s">48</hi> For all the information here, I am indebted to Miss J. E. Poole, Senior Assistant Keeper, Department of Applied Art, Fitzwilliam Museum, and to R.L. Judge (optician) whose analysis she generously solicited.
                                        <p>The description in David Bindman, <hi rend="i">William Blake: Catalogue of the Collection in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge</hi> (1970), 60, based on the examination of Dr H.L. Backhouse, is:
<q>
Temple support for side pieces. Right eye: −2.75 dioptre sphere; left eye:−2.5 dioptre sphere. Ground on inner surface, plano-convex; diameter 30 mm. There is no correction for astigmatism; this was apparently not possible in the early nineteenth century.
</q></p><p>According to Alexander Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake, ‘Pictor Ignotus’</hi> (1863), I, 315, “He wore glasses only occasionally.” No contemporary representation of Blake shows him wearing spectacles (Geoffrey Keynes, <hi rend="i">The Complete Portraiture of William &amp; Catherine Blake</hi> [1977]), and there is some evidence that about 1815 he wore half-lens spectacles, which must have been replaced by the Fitzwilliam pair.</p></note></p>
                <p>The very worn, dark brown cardboard case (12.9 × 4.5 cm) which has accompanied them at least since 1937 (see below) is 
<pb id="p29-141" n="141"/>
rectangular with rounded ends; it is stamped or moulded with panels containing a stylized flowerhead. When one end is pulled away from the other it reveals a green area, and the interior of that lower or left part is blue; the interior of the upper or right part is uncolored.</p>
                <p>History: (1) Acquired from Mrs. Blake (according to the 1937 catalogue below) by (2) Samuel Palmer, from whom they passed to his son (3) A. H. Palmer;<ref target="n49" type="note">49</ref> (4) Acquired by Lt. Col. W. E. Moss, who sold them at Sotheby’s, 2 March 1937, Lot 283 (with “an old cardboard case”); (5) Acquired by Lord Rothschild, who gave them in 1948 to (6) The Fitzwilliam Museum (M.9.1948). <note id="n49"><hi rend="s">49</hi> A. H. Palmer wrote in a note still accompanying them: “These spectacles were once the property of William Blake; &amp; were much valued by his friend and disciple Samuel Palmer. <hi rend="i">A.H.

<q>
By the next vessel you shall have some Enfield’s Speaker &amp; a few other articles, the elegant plates which accompany this work give it so decided a preference, independant of the accuracy with which it is printed over every other edition which has been printed upon me that you cannot fail having a large demand for it[.]<ref target="n51" type="note">51</ref><note id="n51"><hi rend="s">51</hi> Quoted, like the other Joseph Johnson correspondence here, from office transcripts in the newly-discovered Joseph Johnson Letter-Book now in the The Carl H.

The Letter-Book was copied in approximately chronological order.</note></q><pb id="p29-144" n="144"/>
And six weeks later, on 10 October, he wrote again:
<q>
When the drawback is deducted the price of Enfield’s Speaker &amp; Exercises is reduced to 2/4 which I apprehend they would cost you, without the plates, if you were to print &amp; bind them yourself indeed my profit is small but I do expect a considerable demand for them from you; these books are universally used in schools here, of the Exercises we use about one half of what we sell of the Speaker.

              <p>When John Murray, the chief publisher of the first edition of Lavater’s <hi rend="i">Essays on Physiognomy</hi> (1789-98), died in 1793, the business was left to his under-age son in partnership with Highly, and the accounts for the Lavater book were left in some disarray.<ref target="n54" type="note">54</ref> The other partners in the venture clearly asked Joseph Johnson to speak for them, and his office Letter-Book contains numerous letters on the subject, to the engraver Thomas Holloway (23 July 1799); B. Dugdale (Dublin, 13 Oct 1800); Mr Highly (19 and 31 Dec 1800); Mr Mayne (Star Office, 28 Aug 1801); Gentlemen (5 Sept 1801 for Hen. Hunter [the translator of the work], J. Johnson, Tho Holloway, apparently “the Proprietors of the English Lavater”); Exec of M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Murray (23 Sept 1801); and B. Dugdale (Dublin, 19 Nov 1801). These letters deal particularly with monies not yet distributed by Murray to the other Proprietors of the English Lavater<ref target="n55" type="note">55</ref> and with heavy charges of Thomas Holloway for supervising all
<pb id="p29-145" n="145"/>
the engravings. For instance, Johnson wrote to
<q>
M.<hi rend="s">r</hi> Highly<lb/><lb/>
There is, certainly, no provision made for M.<hi rend="s">r</hi> Holloway’s extra charges, indeed they could not then have been foreseen. the necessity &amp; difficulty of obtaining facsimilies soon appeared as essential to the work, but elegance only was at first thought of. At our meetings M.<hi rend="s">r</hi> H was continually reminding us of the difficulty he found with all the engravers, and that he could not get a facsimile from any of them, he told us he was obliged to work himself on every plate to make it what it should be, and we certainly were prepared, &amp; in his absence frequently mentioned it, for a large extra demand on this account. After what has passed &amp; our knowing that he devoted all most [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] of his whole time to the work, &amp; having acquited himself so well, I think it would be not only illiberal but unjust to bind him to the agreement. How executors may feel, or think themselves empowered to act, is not for me to say. The extra charges are certainly very great. I shall concur in any mode of adjusting this business which shall promise liberal justice to M.<hi rend="s">r</hi> Holloway.<lb/>

And on 28 August 1801 he wrote to Mr. Mayne, Star Office:
<q>
it appears that a very large proportion of the subscr:<hi rend="s">rs</hi> have not completed their sets . . . a very considerable part of expected profit will be lost if so many numbers are left upon our hands, and it may be fairly presumed that many who have taken three parts would upon a proper application take the remaining fourth.

              <p>When Stedman’s book was going through the press in 1796, its irrascible author not only went to London to interfere in the printing of the work, and as he wrote in his Journal for January and February 1796:
<q>
I sent besides to London Hansard [<hi rend="i">the printer, all the preliminaries for the book, index, etc.</hi>] . . . I charged hansard not to trust the above papers with Johnson who I would now not Save from the gallows[,] with only one of them so cruelly was I treated—and I declare him a Scound[<hi rend="i">r</hi>]ell without he gives me Satisfaction .... Johnson, the demon of hell, again torments me by altering the dedication to the Prince of Wales &amp;c., &amp;c., he being a d-mn’d eternal [<hi rend="i">infernal?</hi>] Jacobin scoundrel.<ref target="n56" type="note">56</ref><note id="n56"><hi rend="s">56</hi><hi rend="i"> Blake Records</hi> (1969), 50-51.</note></q></p>
              <p>After Stedman’s death in 1797, the Jacobin scoundrel wrote on 25 October 1799 to Stedman’s widow in Tiverton, Devon:
<q>
Dear Madam<lb/>
I wish to consult y.<hi rend="s">e</hi> executors upon the following proposal[:]<lb/>
The edition of y.<hi rend="s">e</hi> Colonel’s book being nearly sold I think there is a prospect of another smaller ed.<hi rend="s">n</hi> going off at a cheaper price, &amp; if it meet with your approbation &amp; theirs I will print one at my own risque &amp; expense, &amp; share with you whatever profit may arise from it.<lb/>
J.J.
</q></p>
              <p>Mrs. Stedman was clearly as suspicious of Johnson as her paranoid husband had been, she thought that Johnson owed money for the book, and she put the matter into the hands of an agent. Nine months later, Johnson wrote to
<q>
N Dennis Esq<hi rend="s">r</hi> Tiverton July 9. 1800<lb/>
I have received, copied I suppose from Mr Stedmans book, a long account between him &amp; me, of which I can make nothing. There can be no account between us but what arose out of y<hi rend="s">e</hi> agreement for his Ms. 1 The payment of £300 by me can easily be proved. 2 He was to receive 10/6 every Sub.<hi rend="s">n</hi> of 21/. which he procured. 3 he procured by his own account 200 for which he owes me 100 g.<hi rend="s">s</hi> 3 [<hi rend="i">i.e., 4</hi>] He was to be allowed his own necessary[?] expenses occured [<hi rend="i">?i.e.</hi>, incurred] in y.<hi rend="s">e</hi> printing of ye work which I understood to be occasional postage &amp; carriage of parcels but he has charged £42 for his stay in Lond[<hi rend="i">on</hi>] which was totally unnecessary &amp; put me to an enormous expense in reprinting part of y.<hi rend="s">e</hi> work from mere caprice, &amp; he makes a charge of £3.9.6 for expenses in Setting[?] his Ms—these two charges I object to, his other charges for letters &amp; parcels I agree to, but am ready to settle every difference by arbitr.<hi rend="s">n</hi> if you do not acquiesce with my statement.<lb/>

</q>
Mrs. Stedman seems to have put the matter then in the hands
<pb id="p29-146" n="146"/>
of a London agent, for Johnson then wrote to
<q>
    S.

</q></p>
              <p>It seems fairly plain from Johnson’s straightforward account that Stedman’s estate owed money to Johnson rather than vice versa. Perhaps the matter was dropped here, for there is no more correspondence about Stedman’s <hi rend="i">Narrative</hi> in Johnson’s Letter-Book. The matter was resolved at least to the extent that new editions were published in 1806 and 1813—and clearly the second edition would have been published much earlier but for the obstreperousness of Mrs. Stedman.</p>

              <p>In Blake, there are two contrary concepts of “Infinity.” One is “Eternity,” and the other is a negative concept expressed by such terms as “void,” “vacuum,” “non-entity,” “eternal death,” and “annihilation.”“Void” is directly connected with Newtonian “absolute space and absolute time” and is outside “the human existence.” In Blake’s text, on the contrary, there is “Infinite Space” which is filled with human forms, so that each moment becomes equal to “eternal.”</p>

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>A New Interdisciplinary Series from Macmillan (UK) and St. Martin’s (US)</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Romanticism in Perspective</hi> undertakes a new assessment of romanticism. Its scope is world-wide (European, British, American, African, Asian) and its goal is broad: “to capture the special spirit of Romanticism as conceived in its historical and contemporary contexts, the revivals, renewals, re-evaluations, the original, contentious, and unexplored.” Each volume will be a work of original research, not to exceed 80,000 words. For information, advice, or submissions, contact General Editor, Stephen Prickett (Regius Professor of Language and Literature), Department of English Literature, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, UK or the American Editor, Marilyn Gaull, Department of English, New York University, 19 University Place, Room 212, New York, NY 10003.</p>

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>A collection of over 700 books and other material on William Blake has recently been moved to the new purpose-built City of Westminster Archives Centre. The collection is known as the Preston Blake Library and is on view to the public. It was given to the City of Westminster in 1967 by the collector Kerrison Preston, and was originally housed at Westminster Reference Library. An official relaunch of the collection by the Lord Mayor of Westminster, with a lecture from Blake biographer Peter Ackroyd, is planned for June 1996. For further information on the collection, contact John Sargeant, City of Westminster Archives Centre at 0171 798 2180.</p>

            </title>
          </head>
          <p>Two performances of the opera <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> will be staged in Boulder, CO, in November 1996. The libretto corresponds to the portion of Blake’s story called, “The Bards Song.” It will be performed by acoustic and synthesized orchestral instruments to accompany a cast of vocalists. They will be visually surrounded by a virtual universe based on Blake’s artwork. Blake’s language of gestures will be incorporated into the choreography. The work has been in progress for two years and has a core staff of 13 members.</p>
          <p>Funding is needed to further stage this production and the rest of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> in the following years. This will include developing “Virtual Sets” based on Blake’s artwork and to finish scoring and staging the libretto. If you have any suggestions, and/or want more information, please contact Dana Harden, Golgonooza Productions, P.O. Box 19614, Boulder CO, 80308-2614, (tel) 303-530-7617.<lb/>
